The six coalitions here in Adoulin each require the help of pioneers in their own way to support the colonization effort. These tasks both directly and indirectly support the colonization effort.${prompt};Then let me take a moment to explain a bit more about what we do.${prompt}
We will, of course, pay appropriate recompense to those completing these assignments.

Further, the Twelve Orders will recognize your efforts as you continue to accomplish these goals, and may even provide you with more important duties as you begin to make a name for yourself.${prompt}
This, in turn, will enable the coalitions to increase the number and quality of the services they provide, thereby enabling them to contribute to the colonization project even more.${prompt};Perhaps more significantly, the influence of each coalition will expand as more pioneers fulfill these obligations, and the Twelve Orders will permit them to expand.${prompt}
Likewise, if one coalition does not receive enough pioneer support, it may shrink in scale, even if it had previously expanded. It is for this reason that we try to make our assignments as lucrative as feasible.${prompt};This, in turn, will enable the coalitions to increase the number and quality of the services they provide, thereby enabling them to contribute to the colonization project even more.${prompt}
However, we want to ensure that all pioneers are able to contribute equally. As such, the number of coalition assignments that can be undertaken each day is governed by a system comprised of imprimaturs.${prompt};Likewise, if one coalition does not receive enough pioneer support, it may shrink in scale, even if it had previously expanded.
