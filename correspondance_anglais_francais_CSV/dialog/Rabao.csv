It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt};You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis.
Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.;It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt};Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”;The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt};This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”
As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require.;To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt}

Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.;Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt};Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.;First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.${prompt};Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.

I'm not sure if this Uran-Mafran knows where to find the gate to the underworld, but we should probably prepare for the worst.${prompt};However, if he destroys the gate in the process, that might mean that we could never be reborn again!${prompt}
As such, it is imperative that we get there first and defend it from his evil plan.${prompt};I'm not sure if this Uran-Mafran knows where to find the gate to the underworld, but we should probably prepare for the worst.${prompt}
