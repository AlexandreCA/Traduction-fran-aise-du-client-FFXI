Wait! Just what kind of theory are we talking about here?${prompt};Finally, Garazu-Horeizu used up the lastaru of his magic and turned to his Maelstrom Theory, which was near completion by that point.${prompt}

Garazu-Horeizu believed that this source was the terrestrial avatar itself, and tried to link-wink it to the one found in Sarutabaruta.${prompt};However, if one were to know the source of their magic-wagic, it would definitely broaden their horizons.${prompt}
And then what happened?${prompt};Garazu-Horeizu believed that this source was the terrestrial avatar itself, and tried to link-wink it to the one found in Sarutabaruta.${prompt}

Rather than serving to augmentaru magical power, all of the magic contained within that area was lost, and there was nothing left for Gurebu-Ogurebu and Medada to do.${prompt};Well, the theory actually turned out to be wrong and it ended in abjectaru failure.${prompt}
