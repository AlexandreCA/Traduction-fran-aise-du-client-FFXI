Whaaat? Why!?${prompt};Yes, ma'am!${prompt}
Do you expect us to drag a kid out to battle?${prompt};You go home.${prompt}
And you.;Whaaat? Why!?${prompt}
You're an adventurer, right? Naja's got you under her thumb, doesn't she?${prompt};Do you expect us to drag a kid out to battle?${prompt}
And this ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman]. The Immortals are blue mages, and you have the nerve to bring one here! Simply revolting.${prompt};And you.
And you.;You're an adventurer, right? Naja's got you under her thumb, doesn't she?${prompt}
You're a mercenary, right? You're a lapdog of the Empire!${prompt};And this ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman]. The Immortals are blue mages, and you have the nerve to bring one here! Simply revolting.${prompt}
But ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] isn't a bad ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman]! ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] searched all over Whitegate just to find me!;And you.
Oh, come on... You just gotta let me join the Seagull Phratrie!${prompt};You're a mercenary, right? You're a lapdog of the Empire!${prompt}
Enough of this nonsense!;But ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] isn't a bad ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman]! ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] searched all over Whitegate just to find me!
Get out of here before Qultada sees you!${prompt};Oh, come on... You just gotta let me join the Seagull Phratrie!${prompt}
Come on, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady]... Can't you convince her to let us stay?${prompt};Enough of this nonsense!
You came here to become a corsair too, didn't you?${prompt};Get out of here before Qultada sees you!${prompt}
Do you want to become a corsair?;Come on, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady]... Can't you convince her to let us stay?${prompt}
${selection-lines};You came here to become a corsair too, didn't you?${prompt}
I do!;Do you want to become a corsair?
Not really.${prompt};${selection-lines}
Liar!${prompt};I do!
We do come across people like you occasionally.${prompt};Not really.${prompt}
But words will not get you into the Seagull Phratrie.${prompt};Liar!${prompt}
We favor action.${prompt};We do come across people like you occasionally.${prompt}
If you are serious, you must venture to the land where our ancestors, the corsairs, perished in times past, and bring us an item that proves your courage and resolution.${prompt};But words will not get you into the Seagull Phratrie.${prompt}
Then we can talk.${prompt};We favor action.${prompt}
Wasuhd...;If you are serious, you must venture to the land where our ancestors, the corsairs, perished in times past, and bring us an item that proves your courage and resolution.${prompt}
Are you serious about becoming a corsair?${prompt};Then we can talk.${prompt}
Of course!${prompt};Wasuhd...
Father's going to get angry with me all over again...${prompt};Are you serious about becoming a corsair?${prompt}
But so be it.;Of course!${prompt}
Anyway, you must first pass Zweeha's test.${prompt};Father's going to get angry with me all over again...${prompt}
The corsairs are a free assembly. Race and status mean nothing here. The only thing that matters is strength of will.${prompt};But so be it.
As long as you can prove your courage and resolution, they're sure to accept you as one of us.${prompt};Anyway, you must first pass Zweeha's test.${prompt}
The land where the corsairs perished... I think she may be referring to Talacca Cove.${prompt};The corsairs are a free assembly. Race and status mean nothing here. The only thing that matters is strength of will.${prompt}

I hope you are aware of what happens to trespassers.${prompt};Thanks!
${name-player}?;Who goes there?
It has been long since we last met.${prompt};I hope you are aware of what happens to trespassers.${prompt}
I was beginning to think you headed back to the Middle Lands because Aht Urhgan was too rough for you.${prompt};${name-player}?
Don't listen to her.;It has been long since we last met.${prompt}
She was worried sick about you.${prompt};I was beginning to think you headed back to the Middle Lands because Aht Urhgan was too rough for you.${prompt}
Aznahf, I hear the sharks are craving red-haired Elvaan as of late...${prompt};Don't listen to her.
P-please forgive me, Lady Zweeha!${prompt};She was worried sick about you.${prompt}
Frivolous chatter is forbidden in the Seagull Phratrie. You would do well to remember that too, ${name-player}.${prompt};Aznahf, I hear the sharks are craving red-haired Elvaan as of late...${prompt}
Then again...;P-please forgive me, Lady Zweeha!${prompt}
You have become quite the corsair, haven't you?${prompt};Frivolous chatter is forbidden in the Seagull Phratrie. You would do well to remember that too, ${name-player}.${prompt}
Perhaps Qultada was right about you after all...${prompt};Then again...
${name-player}, the scent of the sea is nothing new to you now... I think it's time for you to take the pledge.${prompt};You have become quite the corsair, haven't you?${prompt}
Take the pledge?;Perhaps Qultada was right about you after all...${prompt}
${selection-lines};${name-player}, the scent of the sea is nothing new to you now... I think it's time for you to take the pledge.${prompt}

No thanks.${prompt};${selection-lines}
How could you be a corsair this long without knowing about the pledge!?${prompt};What pledge?
How can you just refuse something you don't even understand?${prompt};No thanks.${prompt}
The corsair's pledge is...um...${prompt};How could you be a corsair this long without knowing about the pledge!?${prompt}
The pledge makes you an official member of the crew... It professes your loyalty to your shipmates and obedience to the captain, binding your fates together...${prompt};How can you just refuse something you don't even understand?${prompt}
Captain Qultada!${prompt};The corsair's pledge is...um...${prompt}
You swear an oath to the goddess that you will have the courage not to back down from any storm, no matter how rough.${prompt};The pledge makes you an official member of the crew... It professes your loyalty to your shipmates and obedience to the captain, binding your fates together...${prompt}
It is said that when a corsair has not taken the pledge, the goddess grows angry and the skies and seas grow tempestuous...${prompt};Captain Qultada!${prompt}
The bonds between crewmates and obedience to the captain are the pillars of the corsair's life on the perrrilous ocean. That's why it's so important to take the pledge and affirm your commitments!${prompt};You swear an oath to the goddess that you will have the courage not to back down from any storm, no matter how rough.${prompt}

A true corsair would never give up so easily.${prompt};And you can't even make one yourself without ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}...${prompt}
Where there is a will, there is a way. Now we must put forth all our effort into finding that way.${prompt};Surely you're not advising ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to give up before the battle has even begun. What kind of example would that make?${prompt}
Tell me, ${name-player}. You are from the Middle Lands, are you not?${prompt};A true corsair would never give up so easily.${prompt}
The auction houses of Aht Urhgan are linked with Jeuno.${prompt};Where there is a will, there is a way. Now we must put forth all our effort into finding that way.${prompt}

Our battles with the Empire raged day after day after day...${prompt};I was once the Crown Prince of Ephramad.${prompt}
And then during the course of a single night, the entire corsair fleet was annihilated at the hands of Lamiae as the ships slept in port--Lamiae under the control of the Imperial Army.${prompt};My kingdom was destroyed by the Empire of Aht Urhgan while I studied in distant lands...${prompt}

That is the story of my death...${prompt};Our battles with the Empire raged day after day after day...${prompt}
Just a moment.${prompt};And then during the course of a single night, the entire corsair fleet was annihilated at the hands of Lamiae as the ships slept in port--Lamiae under the control of the Imperial Army.${prompt}
Then you really are...dead? A ghost?${prompt};The Black Coffin--the only ship to escape the slaughter--was ambushed by Imperial war galleys and sent to the ocean floor...${prompt}
A ghost...;That is the story of my death...${prompt}
I suppose that I am.${prompt};Just a moment.${prompt}
But, you appear as a living being. Solid to the touch...${prompt};Then you really are...dead? A ghost?${prompt}
I don't think you could call this existence “living.”${prompt};A ghost...
What do you mean?${prompt};I suppose that I am.${prompt}
Even now, I am irrevocably chained to the underworld.${prompt};But, you appear as a living being. Solid to the touch...${prompt}
Does this have something to do with that shadow in Periqia?${prompt};I don't think you could call this existence “living.”${prompt}
The shadow?;What do you mean?${prompt}
Yes, that form will be my fate. As ordained by Odin, my immortal lord...${prompt};Even now, I am irrevocably chained to the underworld.${prompt}
The form of the Dark Rider...?;Does this have something to do with that shadow in Periqia?${prompt}
You miss little, I see.${prompt};The shadow?
As the violent throes of the battered Black Coffin threw me over the side and I sank into the dark, cold waters of oblivion, I made a plea to the dark god...${prompt};Yes, that form will be my fate. As ordained by Odin, my immortal lord...${prompt}
“Great Odin, guardian of the Kingdom of Ephramad, I beseech thee...${prompt};The form of the Dark Rider...?
“If it is but one swing of my blade, grant me the chance for revenge.”${prompt};You miss little, I see.${prompt}
It was then that Odin appeared before me.${prompt};As the violent throes of the battered Black Coffin threw me over the side and I sank into the dark, cold waters of oblivion, I made a plea to the dark god...${prompt}
!!!${prompt};“Great Odin, guardian of the Kingdom of Ephramad, I beseech thee...${prompt}
He spoke to me thus:;“If it is but one swing of my blade, grant me the chance for revenge.”${prompt}
“When the Age of Judgment draws near, I shall grant thy wish...${prompt};It was then that Odin appeared before me.${prompt}
“But once thy revenge is complete, thou shalt destroy mine enemy...Alexander.”${prompt};!!!${prompt}

I am aware of the legend.;“But once thy revenge is complete, thou shalt destroy mine enemy...Alexander.”${prompt}
It is the reason I forged this pact--the chance for revenge against the Empire. The desire consumed my very being...${prompt};Alexander...${prompt}
The next time I awoke, I found myself upon the deck of the Black Coffin, afloat at sea.${prompt};The legendary savior who will be reborn in the body of the iron giant in the hour of the Empire's greatest need...${prompt}
It was as if I had merely slept, albeit for long years...${prompt};I am aware of the legend.
Two hundred years...isn't that right?${prompt};It is the reason I forged this pact--the chance for revenge against the Empire. The desire consumed my very being...${prompt}
Yes.${prompt};The next time I awoke, I found myself upon the deck of the Black Coffin, afloat at sea.${prompt}
To prepare for my war against the Empire, I joined forces with the beastmen.${prompt};It was as if I had merely slept, albeit for long years...${prompt}
I then searched for the automatons--the keys to manipulating the iron giant.${prompt};Two hundred years...isn't that right?${prompt}
But I eventually realized, or should I say, was made to realize:${prompt};Yes.${prompt}
My seething wrath was for the emperor that destroyed my kingdom...${prompt};To prepare for my war against the Empire, I joined forces with the beastmen.${prompt}
...and the empire he ruled during my living years.${prompt};I then searched for the automatons--the keys to manipulating the iron giant.${prompt}
That empire no longer exists. And you, Aphmau, are not the one against whom I seek revenge.${prompt};But I eventually realized, or should I say, was made to realize:${prompt}
Am I not pitiful? A vengeful shade that has lost his taste for vengeance...${prompt};My seething wrath was for the emperor that destroyed my kingdom...${prompt}
You are pitiful...${prompt};...and the empire he ruled during my living years.${prompt}
What!?${prompt};That empire no longer exists. And you, Aphmau, are not the one against whom I seek revenge.${prompt}
You still have the chance to rebuild the Kingdom of Ephramad!${prompt};Am I not pitiful? A vengeful shade that has lost his taste for vengeance...${prompt}
But I...${prompt};You are pitiful...${prompt}
I learned a lot living in the temple.${prompt};What!?${prompt}
The descendants of Ephramad still yearn for the age when their kingdom yet flourished...${prompt};You still have the chance to rebuild the Kingdom of Ephramad!${prompt}
There are those who still fight for such a reality.${prompt};But I...${prompt}
You can help them find the path to the kingdom of their dreams.${prompt};I learned a lot living in the temple.${prompt}
The people of Ephramad...survived...${prompt};The descendants of Ephramad still yearn for the age when their kingdom yet flourished...${prompt}
But this path you speak of, will it not lead to conflict and bloodshed with the Empire, plunging all once again into the flames of war?${prompt};There are those who still fight for such a reality.${prompt}
Admiral. Prince Luzaf. Have you forgotten with whom you speak?${prompt};You can help them find the path to the kingdom of their dreams.${prompt}

Heh.;Admiral. Prince Luzaf. Have you forgotten with whom you speak?${prompt}
Hahaha. You are right.;!${prompt}
And I am still a corsair.;Leave the Empire to us!${prompt}
I will take a gamble on this fool's venture.${prompt};Heh.

You must undo this pact with Odin as soon as possible...${prompt};And I am still a corsair.
Yes...I must seek audience with my dark lord.${prompt};I will take a gamble on this fool's venture.${prompt}
Please, Boss. The tears won't stop.${prompt};That's the spirit!
Flit...${prompt};You must undo this pact with Odin as soon as possible...${prompt}
Giving up on the revenge business is your call.${prompt};Yes...I must seek audience with my dark lord.${prompt}
But your crew has been restored, and your ship raised from the ocean floor.${prompt};Please, Boss. The tears won't stop.${prompt}
The pact must be honored.${prompt};Flit...${prompt}
Your path lies in one direction only:${prompt};Giving up on the revenge business is your call.${prompt}
To Hazhalm, and an existence as the new Dark Rider, incarnation of the Great Odin.${prompt};But your crew has been restored, and your ship raised from the ocean floor.${prompt}

What a tragedy. A real shame, it is.;...${prompt}

Enough, Flit.${prompt};The poor little Empress floundering in the dark.${prompt}
Went a little bit far there, didn't I?;You spent so much energy playing the part of a puppetmaster, you never noticed the Grand Vizier pulling your strings.${prompt}
How about I make it up by teaching you about Hazhalm?${prompt};How dare you!${prompt}
It was the site for alchemical experiments that pushed the limits of reason.${prompt};Enough, Flit.${prompt}
The reckless fools eventually ripped the very fabric of reality, and opened a door into Odin's domain--without even knocking, I might add.${prompt};Went a little bit far there, didn't I?
Of course, we've been using that tear as a shortcut into this world.${prompt};How about I make it up by teaching you about Hazhalm?${prompt}

Did you find the pteraketos?${prompt};Kah.${prompt}
Well, that's definitely not the news we were hoping to hear.${prompt};The apkallu elder wants you to deliver a message to the Seagull Phratrie.
About what the apkallu elder said...;Hey, we've been waiting for you!
I had thought it was only just a legend.${prompt};Did you find the pteraketos?${prompt}
Huh? What legend is that?${prompt};Well, that's definitely not the news we were hoping to hear.${prompt}
It comes from the Kingdom of Ephramad.;About what the apkallu elder said...
“When the apkallu speaks, so does the ocean.;I had thought it was only just a legend.${prompt}
If you don't listen, the kingdom is doomed.”${prompt};Huh? What legend is that?${prompt}
Still, I never expected the likes of the Mamool Ja and Lamiae to be caught up in this matter too.${prompt};It comes from the Kingdom of Ephramad.
Wh-wh-what should we do?${prompt};“When the apkallu speaks, so does the ocean.
I know you were mad about the ship being destroyed, but it looks like the pteraketos lost something equally important.${prompt};If you don't listen, the kingdom is doomed.”${prompt}
Well, it's not like we can do anything about that now!${prompt};Still, I never expected the likes of the Mamool Ja and Lamiae to be caught up in this matter too.${prompt}

Yeah, I'd say the both of you are pretty much done for.${prompt};Well, it's not like we can do anything about that now!${prompt}
Okay now, let's stop scaring the lads, shall we?${prompt};If they find out that I was the one on that ship...${prompt}
${name-player}, these Mamool Ja with the fins and the Lamiae--they don't know about Mutihb or Aznahf, right?${prompt};Or if they find out that I own the ship...${prompt}
Well, that's one less thing to worry about.;Yeah, I'd say the both of you are pretty much done for.${prompt}
Actually, this could be a good opportunity for us.${prompt};Okay now, let's stop scaring the lads, shall we?${prompt}
Huh? What do you mean, Captain?${prompt};${name-player}, these Mamool Ja with the fins and the Lamiae--they don't know about Mutihb or Aznahf, right?${prompt}
If we can find one of these aeropearl things, we'll receive a magnificent treasure that no one's ever seen before!${prompt};Well, that's one less thing to worry about.
If we play this right, we can repair the Black Cradle and forget about the other ship.${prompt};Actually, this could be a good opportunity for us.${prompt}
I get it!;Huh? What do you mean, Captain?${prompt}
That's a great idea, Captain!${prompt};If we can find one of these aeropearl things, we'll receive a magnificent treasure that no one's ever seen before!${prompt}
Well, I've never heard of these aeropearls before.${prompt};If we play this right, we can repair the Black Cradle and forget about the other ship.${prompt}
How about you guys?${prompt};I get it!
In that case, we'll have to use every last pair of eyes, ears, hands, and feet that the Seagull Phratrie can muster in order to find the information we need.${prompt};That's a great idea, Captain!${prompt}
Besides, if it comes from the bottom of the sea, then it's nothing that us corsairs can't find.;Well, I've never heard of these aeropearls before.${prompt}
We'll find it eventually.${prompt};How about you guys?${prompt}
Let's go, everyone!;In that case, we'll have to use every last pair of eyes, ears, hands, and feet that the Seagull Phratrie can muster in order to find the information we need.${prompt}

And if it does, it's likely to crack open eventually and you know what will happen then!${prompt};“W-we can't allow such a terrible thing to come to pass.
Besides, I heard the Olduum staff lost its power.;Th-there are none who could defeat that beast.”${prompt}
That means there's nothing anyone can do about the matter.${prompt};What!? But if the pteraketos is unable to submerge with the egg, won't it float back up to the surface?${prompt}
