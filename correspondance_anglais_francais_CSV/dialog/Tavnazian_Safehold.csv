For example, say I was to attempt to alter the polymolecular makeup of this clam using the Xenomatter in question. As you know, this particular variety of clam only lives in the shallows of a certain tiny island far off the coast of southeastern Mindartia.;Let me explain further...
To find one of these specimens, not only would one have to be an expert on the clam's native habitat, but also be knowledgeable of their mating and feeding patterns, their reactions to the rise and fall of geothermal temperature levels, as well as their migratory tendencies, and how all these are affected by the varying seasonal lunar cycles.

After sealing the box with a cermopolymer compound (to prevent unnecessary carbo-oxidization), it is only a matter of minutes before a micronucleic reaction occurs and a minute quantity of fluoroplasm is released.${prompt};However, large quantities of this rare species of bivalve mollusk are crucial in order to procure enough reliable data to prove my hypotheses infallible.

I have come to the conclusion that the energy for this reaction comes from the calcitron particles concealed within the mucocide membranes located between the abdominal region of the clam and its shell.

Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.;It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt};Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”;The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!${prompt};This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”

You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically.;If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.${prompt}

Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt};From here, it becomes a race against the clock!
Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.;Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.${prompt}
First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt};Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task.
Next, you can begin to ${color: 5}feed fewell${color: 1} into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration.;First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.${prompt}
