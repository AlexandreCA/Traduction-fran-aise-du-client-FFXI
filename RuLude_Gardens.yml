    I got it, thanks, kupo!${prompt}
  6642: The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!${prompt}
  6643: You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!${prompt}
  6644: The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!${prompt}
  6645: You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!${prompt}
  6646: If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!${prompt}
  6647: You can send items and gil to your friends with the “Send” command, kupo!${prompt}
  6648: (Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the "Exclusive" attribute, kupo...!)${prompt}
  6649: Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!${prompt}

  6653: As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!${prompt}
  6654: This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...${prompt}
  6655: It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!${prompt}
  6656: If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!${prompt}
  6657: Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the “Layout” command, kupo!${prompt}
  6658: |-
    It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo!
    Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!${prompt}

  6660: You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!${prompt}

    I'll go wherever my master wills.♪${prompt}
  6672: |-
    Master!
    I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!${prompt}
  6673: But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select “Mog House” from the main menu and check, kupo!${prompt}
  6674: When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!${prompt}

  6695: |-
    At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you!
    Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!${prompt}

  6726: |-
    Oh, Master, look at this! I was poking around in the drawers of your ${item-singular: 3[2]}, when this ${item-singular: 4[2]} just popped out!

    Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!${prompt}
  6744: Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.${prompt}

    Select this song?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, this sounds splendid!
    No, I've changed my tune.${prompt}
  6791: This song cannot yet be played.
  6792: Hang on! I have an amazing announcement!${prompt}
  6793: |-
    The hallowed halls of your house are even more exciting!
    Why? Because now there's a second floor, kupo!${prompt}
  6794: But before you bash your way in, I've got a trifling task for you to tackle.${prompt}
  6795: Capricious Mithra cubs have cajoled critical information out of the M.H.M.U., and I want you to wrest it from them!${prompt}
  6796: Visit the three nations and question them, kupo!${prompt}
  6797: Now you know the nitty-gritty, so enjoy your new floor, kupo!${prompt}
  6798: Kupopo? You mean you already know?${prompt}
  6799: Magnificent and marvelous! Then proceed without delay!${prompt}
  6800: Enjoy extra space to store your sundries!${prompt}
  6801: Remodel your room to fit your finicky tastes!${prompt}
  6802: Incorporate ostentatious overseas objects! All this and more!${prompt}
  6803: But only on the second floor, kupo. I like the first floor as it is.${prompt}
  6804: And as for your potted plants--they only persevere on the ground, kupo.${prompt}
  6805: And moghancement effects only activate for furnishings fitted to the first floor.${prompt}
  6806: Wish we could help more, but we spend enormous amounts of energy on one floor already!${prompt}
  6807: Go forth and frolic in your new abode, kupo!${prompt}
  6808: You can access the antechambers from the front door. Enjoy!${prompt}
  6809: '${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 3[2]} might bring a certain je ne sais quoi to your Mog House, kupo!${prompt}'
  6810: |-
    What's this, then?
    Someone gave you this envelope, did they?${prompt}
  6811: Wh-what is this!?${prompt}
  6812: |-
    This rubbish does not fool me!
    I know a forgery when I see one.${prompt}
  6813: |-
    Most unpleasant.
    Do not speak to me of this matter again!${prompt}
  6814: You called for me, Your Majesty?${prompt}
  6815: |-
    Francmage?
    I was not expecting you so soon. Monarlais...tell him.${prompt}
  6816: Yes, sire.
  6817: Francmage, I've summoned you here today to talk about one thing--the Northlands investigation.${prompt}
  6818: Oh, yes, that. Those Bastoker Humes are causing no end of trouble--saying they want to investigate here, there, and the other place...${prompt}
  6819: It is true! The Humes are fools, and no better. Can they truly believe that some ancient power lies hidden in that forsaken wasteland?${prompt}
  6820: Hah! Do they hope to find the gates to eternal Paradise there, in that lair of fiends most uncouth? Preposterous!${prompt}
  6821: We must take control of this situation immediately. Still, we cannot let them walk about the Northlands freely. Who knows what they're plotting under the guise of this “investigation.”${prompt}
  6822: Francmage, listen. Go with the investigation party, and keep a close eye on what our foreign “friends” do. They are up to something, it is certain.${prompt}
  6823: I am sure nothing will come of this, but in case they do find something in that wasteland, do not let them take it. Understood?${prompt}
  6824: As you command, my lord. I would give the very blood that runs in my veins if it were to further the cause of our kingdom. You can rely on me.${prompt}
  6825: These foreigners are wily and faithless. Never let down your guard, and may the Goddess of the Dawn protect you in Her mercy.${prompt}
  6826: The king has taken a beautiful queen, and I think a splendid addition to the royal family is not far off. An heir, perhaps...${prompt}
  6827: We people of San d'Oria, too, must ever look to the future. The Elvaan must never fall behind foreigners, in power or faith.${prompt}
  6828: I understand, Your Grace.${prompt}
  6829: Very good. Do well, Francmage.${prompt}
  6830: Yes, sire! My life for the Kingdom!${prompt}
  6831: |-
    As I thought, there is nothing here...
    Only barren wastelands as far as the eye can see.${prompt}
  6832: |-
    But there is something wrong about this place, I can feel it.
    I don't think-wink we should leave Xarcabard yet.${prompt}
  6833: |-
    I agree. My nose has never failed me, but I don't smell anything. That's not normal.
    Something really terrrible must've happened here a long time ago.${prompt}
  6834: |-
    Ridiculous. We cannot base our decisions on your feelings alone.
    You can stay and look for whatever “terrible thing” is supposed to be here, but I--${prompt}
  6835: |-
    Help! Come quick!
    Raogrimm and Cornelia, they--${prompt}
  6836: Ulrich? What happened!?${prompt}
  6837: We were attacked by fiends, and Raogrimm and Cornelia fell down a crevice...${prompt}
  6838: Oh, no! Oh, no!${prompt}
  6839: Grr! Where!?${prompt}
  6840: 'This way!${wait-animation: 3}'
  6841: Raogrimm and Cornelia...where could they have gone?${prompt}
  6842: We have to assume the worrrst. If I can't find them, no one can.${prompt}
  6843: |-
    Why must Humes and Galka be so irresponsible!?
    It is their fault for wandering off without telling us!${prompt}
  6844: |-
    There are too few of us left to continue. I say we go back.
    Besides, we would find nothing even if we stayed.${prompt}
  6845: |-
    I second that.
    I've had enough of this crrreepy place anyway.${prompt}
  6846: B-but, there are still places we haven't looked--${prompt}
  6847: |-
    We have seen enough.
    There is nothing here but dust and ruins.${prompt}
  6848: We accomplished nothing but losing two members of our party and wasting an extraordinary amount of time...${prompt}
  6849: |-
    Yeah, you're right.
    This whole expedition was a failure. Let's head back tomorrow.${prompt}
  6850: |-
    Ulrich.
    Tell me something... Was it really an accident?${prompt}
  6851: What do you mean?${prompt}
  6852: Is it not true that there is some...shall we say, tension, between Humes and Galka in Bastok these days?${prompt}
  6853: Are you accusing me of something, Elvaan?${prompt}
  6854: Hah! Calm down. I do not care if it was an accident or not. I care even less about your little country's problems.${prompt}
  6855: |-
    Just...do not cause any more trouble with such trivial matters while I am around.
    That is all.${prompt}
  6856: '...${prompt}'
  6857: |-
    It is quite late to be up and about, Sir Francmage.
    Is something wrong?${wait-animation: 4}
  6858: |-
    Ah, Courisaille.
    It's nothing. I could not sleep, so I decided to take a walk.
    Leave me; I am fine.${wait-animation: 4}
  6859: 'Yes, sir.${wait-animation: 4}'
  6860: |-
    No! Not you...?
    Raogrimm? What do you mean!?
    He died in an accident! I know nothing!${prompt}
  6861: |-
    Sir Francmage?
    Are you all right, sir?${prompt}
  6862: |-
    Stop! Do not come any further!
    No, nooo--${prompt}

  10124: Mes sources me disent que les hommes-bêtes de Davoi, de Beadeaux et du château d’Oztroja conspirent pour le ramener à Vana'diel.${prompt}
  10125: Ils cherchent à le faire en exploitant le pouvoir de pierres mystérieuses appelées magicite.${prompt}
  10126: Pour mettre fin à leur plan infâme, je veux que vous vous rendiez à ces trois endroits et que vous vous empariez de cette magicite.${prompt}
  10127: 'Bien entendu, j’ai l’intention de vous récompenser pour une tâche de cette ampleur. J’émettrai ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} dès réception des trois magicites.${prompt}'
  10128: With it, you can swiftly travel home, or to any civilized land, for that matter.${prompt}
  10129: So they're after magicite, are they? I wonder what this means... Take extra special care. The thought of a world under the control of the beastmen makes me shudder.${prompt}
  10130: I bet the beastmen have traps waiting. First, you've got to find out as much as you can.${prompt}
  10131: Eald'narche speaks the truth. Start by finding out what you can in town. I'm counting on you!${prompt}
  10132: A moment, please.${prompt}
  10133: By the order of His Grace, we have decided to seek the assistance of the Tenshodo, the organization run by that Aldo fellow.${prompt}
  10134: This secret dispatch outlines our wishes. Would you be so kind as to deliver it to him?${prompt}
  10135: He is a man of many talents. It would be wise to seek his acquaintance. Good luck!${prompt}
  10136: Excellent work. How fares the archduke?${prompt}
  10137: He wants you to gather the magicite? I know nothing about objects of lore, but perhaps you should try learning more about Davoi, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja.${prompt}
  10138: At ease, soldier. So, how was the archduke?${prompt}
  10139: He wants you to gather magicite? That kind of thing is far beyond my expertise, so you should scour the land for clues on Davoi, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja.${prompt}
  10140: So, you saw the archduke... Well, how did it go?${prompt}
  10141: He wants you to gather magicite? I can't offer any advice on those. Maybe you can try learning about Davoi, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja...${prompt}
  10142: Magicite! Yes, these stones emit the same power as crystals. Though impure, that power is great indeed.${prompt}
  10143: Now it is clear why the beastmen gathered where they did. They were drawn to the magicite's great power!${prompt}
  10144: Yes, it is time to eradicate the beastman threat once and for all.${prompt}
  10145: 'I thank you for your service. Here is ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}. With it, you may travel to any nation you please.${prompt}'
  10146: 'For now, I thank you for your service. Since you already have ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}, please accept this instead. May you spend it wisely.${prompt}'
  10147: The three stones are incomplete, but with the powers of the fourth stone that rests deep beneath Castle Zvahl...${prompt}
  10148: Perhaps then the Shadow Lord will rise again.${prompt}
  10149: Of course, the talisman that seals Zvahl's inner depths was put in place over twenty years ago. It would stop any attempt.${prompt}
  10150: I've also read that the three keys to open the seal were kept safely by the three great nations...${prompt}
  10151: Your Grace!${prompt}
  10152: What is it?${prompt}
  10153: Dire news, Your Grace! The leaders of all three nations have been attacked!${prompt}
  10154: Attacked... By beastmen?${prompt}
  10155: Yes, Your Grace.${prompt}
  10156: Confound them! They're one step ahead of us.${prompt}
  10157: So, they seek to resurrect the Shadow Lord... Quite a lofty goal for beastmen.${prompt}
  10158: So be it, then. Perhaps you should return to your embassy.${prompt}
  10159: I will call for your aid again soon. Until then, be well.${prompt}
  10160: Hey, what's going on? Oh, you don't have to tell me.${prompt}
  10161: Oh, so you went to Castle Oztroja and met a girl named Verena there.${prompt}
  10162: And she gets along with the beastmen. Wow, so maybe we could get along.${prompt}
  10163: Hey, Wolfgang! Wolfie, you here?${prompt}
  10164: What would you ask of me, Lord Eald'narche?${prompt}
  10165: Could you find someone named Verena and bring her here? I heard she's Aldo's little sister.${prompt}
  10166: Of course, my lord. But may I ask why? She seems of...questionable intentions.${prompt}
  10167: I think she has some nifty powers, so I just want to play with her. That's all.${prompt}
  10168: Oh, and don't tell this to Kam'lanaut. I want to surprise him.${prompt}
  10169: As you wish, my lord.${prompt}
  10170: Heh. I can't wait!${prompt}
  10171: ${name-player}! At long last you return! Congratulations on your success!${prompt}
  10172: I regret you have no time for reprieve. Our beloved San d'Oria is in danger!${prompt}
  10173: Her Excellency is away, so please take this to the court in her stead. Take the airship! I will remain and do what I can.${prompt}
  10174: Make haste to San d'Oria! You can board the airship now, can you not? I will remain here and find out what I can.${prompt}
  10175: Well, I am relieved there was no danger. Our embassy is safe as well. For now, obey the court's commands.${prompt}
  10176: ${name-player}! You made it back in one piece!${prompt}
  10177: No time for R&R, soldier! Your country needs you!${prompt}
  10178: The ambassador's away, so you'll have to carry this back to the administration. Take the airship! I'll stay here to get to the bottom of this.${prompt}
  10179: Get on that airship to Bastok, soldier! I'll stay here and find out what I can.${prompt}
  10180: So, it's business as usual in Bastok, huh? Well, we have nothing special for you here, so try following the administration's directives.${prompt}
  10181: There you are! Great work, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  10182: I'm sorry, but you've got no time to rest! Our beloved Windurst is in grave danger!${prompt}
  10183: With the ambassador away, I want you to take this back to the motherland. Take the airship; it's faster. I'll find out what I can here.${prompt}
  10184: Hurry-scurry! Take the airship back to Windurst! I'll find out what I can here.${prompt}
  10185: As long as the Star Sibyl is safe, then all is well. We don't have any tasks for you here, so continue your service to your country.${prompt}
  10186: 'You don''t have ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  10187: Nobody sees the sovereign without an appointment!${prompt}
  10188: Stand down!${prompt}
  10189: 'Just a moment. I need to see your ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}...${prompt}'
  10190: Thank you. If the sovereign requests your audience, access to the chamber will be granted by the guards inside.${prompt}
  10191: 'I''m sorry, but you will need ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} to get in.${prompt}'
  10192: This the hall of the Ducal Guards. Only the finest warriors may join. Come to think of it, this is no place for civilians like you.${prompt}
  10193: Sir Wolfgang is our leader. He was selected not just for his skill at arms, but also for his unwavering determination.${prompt}
  10194: Who are you and what's your business!? Oh, you're an attaché... My apologies! I have to check everyone who passes through here.${prompt}
  10195: In this job, I assume everyone's guilty until proven innocent. I meant no offense.${prompt}
  10196: Welcome. This is the home of the archduke, so please conduct yourself accordingly.${prompt}
  10197: Lords Kam'lanaut and Eald'narche rarely make public appearances.${prompt}
  10198: And you need a special permit just to have an audience with them.${prompt}
  10199: Both have kept their youth through all these years. Perhaps some otherworldly power watches over them. Great prophets like them are few indeed!${prompt}
  10200: Say... You know Aldo, the guy who runs the organization called the Tenshodo?${prompt}
  10201: |-
    Do you know him?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  10202: The Tenshodo was founded by Aldo's father. They've done so well in trading abroad that they own the black market in these parts. Er, so I've heard...${prompt}
  10203: Aldo took over after his father died. I've heard all kinds of things about him, but they say he's a smart and honorable man.${prompt}
  10204: Oh, you're a Tenshodo member? I guess you know more than I do, then.${prompt}
  10205: You should do business with the Tenshodo, too. They supply us with hard-to-find goods now and then.${prompt}
  10206: Beyond us stands the peace monument, constructed after the war. The embassies were built around it.${prompt}
  10207: Lords Kam'lanaut and Eald'narche designed these gardens of Ru'Lude. One look is enough to see how much they treasure peace.${prompt}
  10208: These grounds are the domain of Lords Kam'lanaut and Eald'narche. Please conduct yourself properly.${prompt}
  10209: Have you ever met Lord Eald'narche? He's still a lad, but the archduke's brother is gifted with incredible talents.${prompt}
  10210: Jeuno is safe as long as it has Archduke Kam'lanaut and Lord Eald'narche.${prompt}
  10211: The three great nations preach friendship, but beneath the facade is a struggle for supremacy. Nobody can tell what will come of it.${prompt}
  10212: That is why we must focus on our duties. There is no guarantee that the reign of peace we enjoy now will last.${prompt}
  10213: Did you know that Lord Eald'narche wears an eye patch? He had an accident when he was little, but it hasn't fazed him! Bless his heart.${prompt}
  10214: In the chaos of war, the archduke had a brilliant plan. He believed that the three nations' only chance was to cast aside their squabbles and stand as one.${prompt}
  10215: Each nation had to shoulder an equal burden in the struggle against the beastmen. His strategy was truly brilliant!${prompt}
  10216: Without his guidance, this world would have turned to shadow under the domination of the beastmen.${prompt}
  10217: In the past, there was a terrible war. My father once told me how the earth, swept by furious winds, was soaked in the blood of the fallen.${prompt}
  10218: I heard his tales every time he drowned his sorrows in drink. Now his stories are etched in my mind.${prompt}
  10219: Sir Wolfgang's father was a famous soldier, too. He commanded Jeuno's forces in the Crystal War, and his exploits are legendary.${prompt}
  10220: After the war, he looked after the families of his fallen comrades. What a great man... There's more to being a soldier than just brute strength!${prompt}
  10221: Sometimes I see the darndest things here. One time, a rookie of ours got cursed in the necropolis of Eldieme, and I didn't know what to do.${prompt}
  10222: I bet things are brewing that are way too crazy for us to imagine.${prompt}
  10223: Once I took a new guy to the Eldieme Necropolis, and he got cursed there. He went berserk, and had this unstoppable craving for raw meat.${prompt}
  10224: Well, I gave it some thought... And you know those torches in the rooms made of stone? Well, I heard that spirits hate them...${prompt}
  10225: |-
    So, I figured it might help if I lit a lantern with those flames and brought it here.
    That's how we saved the guy.${prompt}
  10226: But, uh... I've also heard that some spirits actually like that kind of fire. So, it might not always be such a good idea.${prompt}
  10227: I guess we were lucky then. We had no idea what else to do, and just wanted to do what we could.${prompt}
  10228: If you want, we can lend you the lantern we used back then. What do you say?${prompt}
  10229: |-
    Do you want to borrow the lantern?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, please.
    Not now.${prompt}
  10230: Try and bring back the flames in this lantern. We don't know what else could help.${prompt}
  10231: I seem to remember there were four torches, and that you had to light them in the proper order.${prompt}
  10232: Yeah, that's right. I remember screwing that up. Too bad I forgot the real order, though. Well, I'm sure you can figure it out.${prompt}
  10233: Don't forget it's the stone-wrought room that you're after. The torches in the caverns are for something else, so don't mix them up.${prompt}
  10234: Oh, yeah? Well, you're free to use it any time.${prompt}
  10235: If you knew exactly which spirit is doing the possessing, then you can figure out how to exorcise it. But that's the last resort, you know?${prompt}
  10236: Oh, the flame thing didn't work, huh? Well, I'm just glad the spirit's gone!${prompt}
  10237: Yep, I knew it. You learn something every day. I'm gonna write this up in the Guardsman's Daily.${prompt}
  10238: I always wondered how someone of his height lit that lantern.${prompt}
  10239: The archduke hosts so many dignitaries, every night is a banquet. Composing original menus makes me fret!${prompt}
  10240: This is the archduke's chamber. Only here can he find refuge from his busy schedule...${prompt}
  10241: But he's always out, doing his best for the Duchy. We all look up to him so much. His deeds benefit not only Jeuno, but the entire world as well.${prompt}
  10242: All I can do in return is change his sheets and prepare hot soup.${prompt}
  10243: These works are part of Lord Eald'narche's collection. His Lordship is versed in history as well as art.${prompt}
  10244: The archduke and his brother often relax in this room. We always wait outside, but they do seem to get along quite well.${prompt}
  10245: I do not pry into their conversations, but their knowledge of politics, culture, and philosophy rivals that of scholars.${prompt}
  10246: Our job is to confront anyone suspicious. Why, if anything happened to the archduke, the repercussions would be felt around the world.${prompt}
  10247: This monument was built at the end of the war...as a reminder that nobody should suffer like that ever again.${prompt}
  10248: And now, people forget the mistakes of the past and quarrel all over again. I bet this is the only place where that promise is still remembered.${prompt}
  10249: I want somebody to take this map I got in the north and stave off impending disaster, but you don't look ready for such a task.${prompt}
  10250: 'Maybe you can take this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} I got in the north, and stave off impending disaster... Do you think you''ve got what it takes?${prompt}'
  10251: |-
    What do you say?
    ${selection-lines}
    I can do it.
    Not now.${prompt}
  10252: 'I knew you were the one! Now bring me ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and show me what you''re made of!${prompt}'
  10253: Well, that's a bummer. I thought you just might be the one!${prompt}
  10254: 'Bring me ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}. I''m counting on you!${prompt}'
  10255: Good job! I knew you could do it. But be on your guard.${prompt}
  10256: Don't forget our vow here. Remember how precious peace is.${prompt}
  10257: Mmm? You've already got one. Well, that's great--think of it as a farewell present.${prompt}
  10258: Good luck with the petition!${prompt}
  10259: Well, if they can tear down the clock tower, who knows what they'll do to the monument? Quick, where do I sign?${prompt}
  10260: Oh, dear... Did you lose your way? I didn't call for a cub like you.${prompt}
  10261: Well, well, well... You might have what it takes. Hear me out. You've got nothing to lose.${prompt}
  10262: |-
    Hear me out, okay?
    ${selection-lines}
    All right.
    No, thanks.${prompt}
  10263: Oh, what a pity. Goodbye.${prompt}
  10264: All right, look. The archduke's running low on food and gifts for all the foreign bigwigs he entertains.${prompt}
  10265: Don't you think something weird's going on? I mean, ambassadors from the three nations stop by all the time, and the train of delegates and caravans never stops.${prompt}
  10266: The reward is really something. It's a key the archduke himself found in the ruins. They say it makes things...automatically. Well? Wanna try it?${prompt}
  10267: |-
    Wanna try it?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  10268: Guess I was wrong about you. Bye.${prompt}
  10269: Oh, now you're talkin'. First, pick out what you're going to collect from this list here.${prompt}
  10270: |-

    Rare Herbs & Vegetables.
    Luxury Weapons and Armor.

  10272: 'Your reward will be ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}. Wanna see the others?${prompt}'
  10273: |-
    Do you want to see the others?
    ${selection-lines}
    You bet.
    Not now.${prompt}
  10274: Okay. So, good luck! You can only have one chip for each element. They break when you use them, so come back if you want more.${prompt}
  10275: What, you don't want to do it? All right. Just pick from this list, then.${prompt}
  10276: Okey-dokey. Not too shabby. This is for you!${prompt}
  10277: I don't know the details, but you're supposed to take it to the ruins underground and put some mineral called ada-something in it. Well, come back anytime!${prompt}
  10278: Now offering quick and easy delivery of packages to homes everywhere!${prompt}
  10279: Would you care to see a map of Greater Jeuno?${prompt}
  10280: |-

    Montrez-moi.
    Pas maintenant. ${prompt}
  10281: Nous sommes dans les jardins de Ru'Lude, au sommet de la superstructure de Jeuno.${prompt}
  10282: C'est un très beau palais. On dirait un château dans les nuages ! Je suis heureux d'avoir fait tout ce chemin pour le voir.
  10283: Oh, où est passée la femme ? Je suppose qu'elle se montrera si je reste ici. ${prompt}
  10284: J'ai la chair de poule en regardant depuis le bord. On se rend vraiment compte de l'altitude à laquelle on se trouve. ${prompt}
  10285: Je me demande comment ils ont réussi à construire cet endroit. Jeuno est pleine de mystères, comme les dirigeables ! Mais le plus grand de tous, c'est l'archiduc. Personne ne sait qui il est ni d'où il vient.${prompt}
  10286: Je vous déteste tous!${prompt}
  10287: Un de mes camarades de classe avait l'habitude de crier cela quand il grimpait sur des endroits élevés. Je me demande ce qu'il voulait dire... ${prompt}
  10288: Mon mari s'est égaré quelque part. Ru'Lude est si grand que je ferais mieux de l'attendre ici.

  10832: The Book of the Gods has taught me everything.${prompt}
  10833: It told me the meaning of the tower and the fountain. And it has taught me how to command the greatest of beasts.${prompt}
  10834: Stars of the heavens, tell me what to do!${prompt}
  10835: Tell me, Karaha-Baruha! Help me!${prompt}
  10836: What happened? Are you all right?${prompt}
  10837: So, thats what magicite looks like.${prompt}
  10838: What could they possibly want with it?${prompt}
  10839: What the...!?
  10840: |-
    You are too late...
    I have already awakened.${prompt}
  10841: Your anger, cowardice, envy, arrogance, and apathy...from these I will spread the bane that will destroy Vanadiel.${prompt}
  10842: Who are you!?${prompt}
  10843: Your kind has awakened me...and this time, you will be destroyed!${prompt}
  10844: |-
    You cannot stop me.
    Vanadiel will be the grave for you and all your kind!${wait-animation: 1}
  10845: |-
    Was that a phantom?
    An image...of the Shadow Lord?${prompt}
  10846: |-
    The Shadow Lord? It cant be!
    His powers cant have returned!${prompt}
  10847: |-
    Then it is true.
    The beastmen are trying to bring the Shadow Lord back.${prompt}
  10848: You be careful, too.${prompt}
  10849: Shoo! Shoo! Keep your grimy claws off of Windurst Orastery minister, Ajido-Marujido!
  10850: You are a fool for coming here to the throne room...alone.${prompt}
  10851: You say you are the Windurst Orastery minister, Ajido-Marujido?${prompt}
  10852: |-
    Gawk! Orastery minister? And I am Aviatory minister!
    How do we know what you speak is not lies? Gawk!${prompt}
  10853: I should cut you up and send you to Heavens Tower! Gawk! Gawk!${prompt}
  10854: |-
    Kahk! Silence...
    Our little friend came all the way from Windurst to greet us. Let us hear what he has to say.${prompt}
  10855: Kahk-ka-ka! You came all this way to ask about the Full Moon Fountain?${prompt}
  10856: Well, you Tartutaru have probably already realized why the Horutoto Ruins were built and why the Full Moon Fountain exists underneath them.${prompt}
  10857: Those ruins are evil.${prompt}
  10858: The towers sponge dry the areas around Sarutabaruta of all their magic.${prompt}
  10859: You think that we Yagudo are the cause of these wastelands, but you only have yourselves to thank. You--the Tarutaru that activated those towers!${prompt}
  10860: The towers are all damaged! How do you explain magic still being drained from the plains of Sarutabaruta?${prompt}
  10861: What about you Yagudo? What are those things that you continue digging? Those stones...maybe they are the cause of all this?${prompt}
  10862: Kahk-ka-ka...I commend you on your perceptiveness.${prompt}
  10863: But the reason Sarutabaruta is becoming a wasteland has nothing to do with those stones.${prompt}
  10864: That night, twenty years ago, when we were defeated by your armies, you made a grave mistake...${prompt}
  10865: Kahk! Kahk! You still do not understand?${prompt}
  10866: Make your way deep into the central tower of the Horutoto Ruins. There you will see first hand what the Star Sibyl and those summoners really did.${prompt}
  10867: The moon and the stars no longer smile upon Windurst. Now, the world shall kneel before the Yagudo!${prompt}
  10868: The bushins so old that hes losing his eyesight!?${prompt}
  10869: |-
    <Sigh>
    Well, it has been thirty years. Just look at me. Im not as young as I used to be.${prompt}
  10870: Ah, those were the days...${prompt}
  10871: |-
    Whats this? You want to know what would impress the bushin? Hmmm...
    Well, when I was still his disciple, I once presented him with ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}.${prompt}
  10872: |-
    He was so pleased that he didnt just let me see the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, he let me try it on!
    I could feel the weight of the souls of all the bushin that had worn it before me.${prompt}
  10873: But that weight was too great for me, and ever since that day, Ive been striving to improve my skills.${prompt}
  10874: But even now I dont think I could even grasp that belt with my own hands, let alone tie it around my waist. I still have much to learn...${prompt}
  10875: |-
    ...
    How many rounds have we gone now, ${name-player}...?${prompt}
  10876: |-
    I remember every single blow, every tiny shift of your stance.
    I cant tell you how much I look forward to our little matches, heh heh heh.${prompt}
  10877: But you know, I never imagined anyone would conquer all the challenges I set before ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]. Goes to show that even old Maat can be taught a thing or two!${prompt}
  10878: |-
    Now, I cant let such a great hero go home empty-handed.
    Ive decided to grant you any one wish you ask of me.
    Dont get too exotic, though. Im just an old man, not some Far Eastern genie!${prompt}
  10879: |-
    Come on, then. No need to be shy.
    Whats it to be?${prompt}
  10880: |-
    ...!
    Take off my hat!?
    Are you sure thats want you want? Not much exciting going on under an old mans cap!${prompt}
  10881: Its not too late to change your mind, you know.${prompt}
  10882: 'There must be something else you want. A lifetime supply of Goblin chocolate? Afternoon tea with Princess Claidie? ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, perhaps? Or maybe ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}?${prompt}'
  10883: |-
    No? Youve made up your mind, it seems.
    Young people these days--no imagination.${prompt}
  10884: |-
    But if thats what you really want, it makes things easy for me, I suppose.
    Ill give you one last chance to change your wish...${prompt}
  10885: Well, alrighty then.${prompt}
  10886: Are you ready?${prompt}
  10887: Try not to blink...${prompt}
  10888: |-
    Heh heh heh.
    Are you happy now? Bet youre thinking you shouldve changed your mind when you had the chance, huh?${prompt}
  10889: Aw, dont look so disappointed, ${name-player}. You think Id let you walk away with nothing but an eyeful of my wrinkled noggin?${prompt}
  10890: Even the mightiest oak will wither with the passing of time. Its vibrant leaves will fade to brown, and crumble into dust. I, too, will one day have to leave this garden behind for good.${prompt}
  10891: Do you understand what Im trying to say?${prompt}
  10892: |-
    When that time comes, I want you to take up this cap and become the mighty oak. Watch over the saplings as they reach towards the sky.
    I know youre up to the task, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10893: Do I have your word?${prompt}
  10894: Well, that takes a load off my mind.${prompt}
  10895: |-
    Ive got plenty of spark left in me, though, so dont go getting ahead of yourself!
    Ill be around whenever youre ready for another bout. Heh heh heh!${prompt}
  10896: No one is allowed to meet with the archduke or the ducal scientists unless it absolutely necessary.${prompt}
  10897: The officials have been extremely busy making arrangements for numerous expeditionary forces to be sent to various locations around Quon and Mindartia.${prompt}
  10898: If you have any business with the archduke or the ducal scientists, please leave your message with us and we will relay it to the proper authorities.${prompt}
  10899: However, we cannot guarantee that you will receive a hasty reply.${prompt}
  10900: There is a man from the Alchemists Guild who has been waiting to speak with the scientists for a number of days.${prompt}
  10901: I believe he is still waiting somewhere near the archdukes quarters. Pour soul...${prompt}
  10902: Did you hear? Some of the Telepoint crystals in Holla, Mea, and Dem have broken into a million pieces!${prompt}
  10903: So thats why Captain Wolfgang has been on edge lately... But what is really going on at those crags?${prompt}
  10904: I see you have begun to show some interest in the strange occurrences that have been taking place in the past few weeks.${prompt}
  10905: |-
    Let me tell you a little of what I have heard...
    Recently, the Duchy has been abuzz with strange tales of travelers being drawn into strange whirlpools located in the Valkurm Dunes and on Qufim Island...and never coming back.${prompt}
  10906: From what I gather, the ducal scientists believe this phenomenon has something to do with the shattered Telepoints at the Crags of Holla, Dem, and Mea.${prompt}
  10907: To collect data, a group of Ducal Guards is to be dispatched any day.${prompt}
  10908: |-
    Strange whirlpools in Valkurm and Qufim...
    Shattered Telepoints...
    What could it all mean?${prompt}
  10909: The investigatory report written by the Ducal Guards mentioned that the whirlpools in Valkurm and Qufim are made up of an unknown substance that they call the “Emptiness.”${prompt}
  10910: |-
    And now there are rumors stating that by jumping into these dark vortexes, people can instantly teleport themselves to the lost island of Tavnazia!
    I dont know about you, but I am staying right here where it is safe!${prompt}
  10911: Ive heard rumors that a bright light shot out of the sea somewhere to the north of Delkfutts Tower.${prompt}
  10912: An investigatory party is scheduled to search the area for clues, but theyll have their work cut out for them. The currents in the Sea of ShuMeyo are unpredictable and violent. Many a captain has lost his ship in those waters.${prompt}
  10913: Did you know there is a mysterious group of officials in Jeuno known as the “Armathrwn Society”?${prompt}
  10914: The last time I tried telling some of the new recruits about the group, Captain Wolfgang put me on latrine duty for nine and a half weeks!${prompt}
  10915: You, a scruffy adventurer, spoke with Sir Nagmolada!?${prompt}
  10916: Did you know that he was a high-ranking member of the prestigious Armathrwn Society--the advisors to Archduke Kamlanaut?${prompt}
  10917: Sir Nagmolada often speaks with common people of the Duchy. I even heard that promotions are granted to those who happen to impress him.${prompt}
  10918: I wonder if he will ever stop to speak with me... What would I say?${prompt}
  10919: Youre an adventurer, right? So youve probably already heard about the humongous dragon that flew over the western skies.${prompt}
  10920: At first everybody thought it might be a stray wyvern, but there are rumors that it was actually one of those ancient “wyrms”!${prompt}
  10921: You want to know about the hooded officials in black robes that sometimes appear in the courtyard?${prompt}
  10922: They are all members of the Armathrwn Society--scientists working for the Duchy. I have heard that there are even quite a few female members.${prompt}
  10923: While the Jeuno Armada is making preparations for battle, it remains the duty of the Ducal Guard to ensure the safety of the citizens of Jeuno.${prompt}
  10924: Did you hear that a super-secret weapon was being loaded onto one of the warships? I wonder what it could be...${prompt}
  10925: Yes, I overheard some of the other guards mention that the societys scientists had built a terrifying new battle machine.${prompt}
  10926: Alright! After using that contraption, along with the airships ultra-powerful mammoth cannons, there wont be enough left of those wyrms to even make dragon burgers!${prompt}
  10927: The Jeuno Armada is readying for an attack on the Wyrmking, Bahamut. However, there is nothing to worry about. Our forces are the strongest, most advanced in all Vanadiel.${prompt}
  10928: Have you seen a strange-looking boy or girl running about the gardens?${prompt}
  10929: If you have, inform one of the Ducal Guards. There are currently warrrrants out for both of their arrrrests.${prompt}
  10930: |-
    Their capture is crucial to the safety of not just Jeuno, but of all Vanadiel.
    You and your fellow adventurers assistance in the matter is greatly appreciated.${prompt}
  10931: |-
    Members of the Armathrwn Society are to accompany the armada on its mission.
    It is said that the societys technological advancements are what built this city and made it what it is today.${prompt}
  10932: Lady Eshantarl is supposedly leading the mission against Bahamut. With such a skilled commander at the armadas helm, there isnt anything in Vanadiel that can stop the Duchy!${prompt}
  10933: I know you may consider your nation a powerful force in Vanadiel, but Jeuno is the only nation with the resources to defeat the Wyrmking. Dont you forget it.${prompt}
  10934: |-
    One of the armada warships is missing!
    With all the tightened security, how could anyone have pulled off a feat as grand as stealing an airship!?${prompt}
  10935: While the Jeuno Armada is conducting its mission in the skies, it remains the duty of the Ducal Guard to ensure the safety of the citizens of Jeuno.${prompt}
  10936: Did you find out anything more about the super-secret weapon the armada took with them?${prompt}
  10937: No... However, I did hear that the device dealt a severe blow to the mighty Wyrmking during the assault.${prompt}'
  10938: Wowzie! If I had an ultra-spiffy contraption like that, Id be eating roast dragon burgers every night!${prompt}
  10939: The latest reports state the recent armada mission was a success. However, it did not completely stop the Wyrmking and his minions. It is rumored that the fleet will launch its second attack once the current repairs on the warships are completed.${prompt}
  10940: If you have any information on the whereabouts of the girl the Duchy was searching for, I am sorry, but the warrant for her arrest has been dropped.${prompt}
  10941: The Ducal Guard recently received news of her death...${prompt}
  10942: Even with the technology of the Armathrwn Society on our side, the armada was unable to completely defeat the Wyrmking and his army. Perhaps we underestimated their power...${prompt}
  10943: In its first wave of attacks, the armada was successful in dealing a large amount of damage to Bahamut. The Wyrmking will not stand a chance against the second wave.${prompt}
  10944: |-
    <Sigh>
    I requested a transfer from the Ducal Guard to the armada crew, but I was turned down...${prompt}
  10945: |-
    Why do I have to stand around the gardens while everyone else is having all the fun? Look at these biceps! I could take out a wyrm with one blow!
    Well...maybe two blows.${prompt}
  10946: We were beginning to wonder when you would arrive, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  10947: The duke vicarious is meeting a messenger from the East as we speak. When she is finished, you shall be next. Until then, you shall be kept in custody.${prompt}
  10948: I apologize for the absence of Grand Duke Kamlanaut. I, Eshantarl, shall serve in his stead.${prompt}
  10949: I hear that you have come from the Eastern Empire to ask something of our nation. State your name and your request.${prompt}
  10950: '...I am Tenzen. Born and raised in the Far East, I serve as a samurai under the mighty dynasty.${prompt}'
  10951: Lady Eshantarl, may I ask why my audience was not met by the duke himself?${prompt}
  10952: '${choice: 1}[Since the revival of the Shadow Lord/Even after the defeat of the Shadow Lord], the grand duke has been overwhelmed with his duties to the people of this land.${prompt}'
  10953: However, you need not worry. I will take the responsibility of relaying your words directly to Lord Kamlanaut.${prompt}
  10954: These two shall be witness to that.${prompt}
  10955: '...${prompt}'
  10956: While short, my message is not a simple one. It is critical that the duke fully understands the grave nature of the situation that lies before us.${prompt}
  10957: What I am about to say does not only affect my homeland, but the countries to the south and west, as well as this fair land.${prompt}
  10958: |-
    The Emptiness is closing in.
    It has already appeared in the far reaches of the Eastern Empire. I can assume that the same is true of the outlying areas in the southern and western lands.${prompt}
  10959: The phenomenon started small, but in recent months it has begun to grow. Like sap oozes slowly from a tree, the Emptiness spreads across my country, swallowing whole the hills and forests.${prompt}
  10960: |-
    As it approaches, the children begin to dream.
    When it arrives, it is not long before the adults, too, begin to dream.${prompt}
  10961: |-
    The dream is always the same...
    It tells us...the Keeper of the Apocalypse will soon appear, and bring with him the end of Vanadiel.${prompt}
  10962: |-
    The Keeper of the Apocalypse...
    A frightening name, is it not?${prompt}
  10963: Your report of this “darkness”--this Emptiness--it is not news to us. In recent weeks, there have been reports of similar phenomena occurring in the areas around Jeuno.${prompt}
  10964: However, these reports state that the Emptiness, as you call it, is localized. That is why we have chosen to withhold this information from the public until it can be further researched. If it is true that the Emptiness has begun to spread, though, an immediate investigation may be necessary.${prompt}
  10965: Shall the Duchy prepare a team?${prompt}
  10966: |-
    ...
    You...do not know why the Emptiness has appeared?${prompt}
  10967: Unfortunately, our scientists have not yet come to any concrete conclusions. If your empire has any definite data, we would be delighted to hear it.${prompt}
  10968: Are you suggesting that the cause of the Emptiness may be found in my land? Do not tell me that you are unaware that the five shards of legend rest here!${prompt}
  10969: Do not tell me that you are unaware that it is the power of the five shards that protects Vanadiel from the Emptiness!${prompt}
  10970: |-
    Tenzen of the East...
    You are very straightforward with your accusations.${prompt}
  10971: |-
    Let me see...
    You feel that Jeuno is the cause of the Emptinesss growth.
    You feel that our attempts to harness the power of the crystals have resulted in the spread of the darkness, am I correct?${prompt}
  10972: Well, I am sorry to say that you are quite mistaken. Jeuno is fully aware of the power that the crystals radiate forth.${prompt}
  10973: The five shards--the mothercrystals--are what support our world.${prompt}
  10974: We, the Duchy, have taken it upon ourselves to inherit the will of the ancients and protect the Zilartian ruins and the crystals they hold.${prompt}
  10975: We have kept this information from the nations of Bastok, Windurst, and San dOria to shield the mothercrystals from those who may wish to wrongly use their power for personal gain.${prompt}
  10976: I see that the Eastern Empire has learned of the crystals existence, and therefore we can no longer trust you, either.${prompt}
  10977: Jeuno cannot allow the power of the mothercrystals to fall into the hands of those who may exploit it.${prompt}
  10978: My countrys only wish is to prevent the Emptiness from taking away any more than it already has!${prompt}
  10979: Seeing, with your own eyes, the darkness drain the life from your homeland... I can understand why you may not agree with our nations stance.${prompt}
  10980: |-
    Very well. I can tell you one thing.
    The Duchy is currently in search of a boy. This boy is thought to be connected in some way to the Emptiness.${prompt}
  10981: Even though he is not one of us, he has already found a way into three of the Zilartian ruins, the Emptiness following in his path.${prompt}
  10982: We here believe that this boy is the Keeper of the Apocalypse of which you speak.${prompt}
  10983: |-
    A boy?
    Could he be a messenger from another nation?${prompt}
  10984: |-
    That we do not know.
    However...${prompt}
  10985: |-
    Wolfgang.
    Show the adventurer in.${prompt}
  10986: |-
    This adventurer was with the boy when he appeared near the mothercrystals.
    ${choice-player-gender}[He/She] hails from the nation of ${choice: 0}[San dOria/Bastok/Windurst].${prompt}
  10987: |-
    ${choice: 0}[San dOria/The Republic/The Federation]!
    What could ${choice: 0}[the king/the president/those mages] be conspiring!?${prompt}
  10988: 'Of course, ${choice: 0}[the Kingdom/Bastok/Windurst] has denied all ties to the boy.${prompt}'
  10989: As has this adventurer.${prompt}
  10990: 'However, if we learn that ${choice: 0}[San d''Oria/the Republic/the Federation] is behind this threat to the mothercrystals and the well-being of all those residing on Vana''diel...${prompt}'
  10991: Whether allies or not, Jeuno will be forced to take action against the nation. We will destroy them.${prompt}
  10992: But this is still nothing more than speculation. If we had the time to conduct a proper investigation, it would be the first thing we did. Unfortunately, time is one luxury we do not have.${prompt}
  10993: And that is why we must capture the boy immediately to learn of what he knows...${prompt}
  10994: |-
    Exactly.
    And that is why I offer you a chance--a chance to prove your countrys true intents by joining this battle to save your nation--no, all of Vanadiel.${prompt}
  10995: |-
    Adventurer.
    Travel to the fourth crystal and wait for the boy. When he arrives, capture him and bring him here.${prompt}
  10996: Unlike the first three crystals, the fourth lies deep beneath Vanadiels surface, somewhere below the glaciers of the Northlands.${prompt}
  10997: Thirty years ago, an allied expedition visited the Northlands. If you could find one of the original members, you may be able to obtain some valuable information.${prompt}
  10998: |-
    Francmage M Mistalle, of the Knights Mistalle in San dOria...
    Iru-Kuiru, from the Rhinostery in Windurst...
    Mythril Musketeer captain, Ulrich, from Bastok...${prompt}
  10999: I have heard news that the criminal accused of destroying the Telepoints was captured and taken into custody.${prompt}
  11000: However, when questioned, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] said she had nothing to do with the incidents. To prove ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] innocence, the Duchy has ordered the scoundrel to travel to the nations of Bastok, Windurst, and San dOria and gather information that will clear ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] name.${prompt}
  11001: What is this? You say you have business with the captain?${prompt}
  11002: |-
    Ah, ${name-player}.
    I was looking for you.${prompt}
  11003: Eshantarl, duke vicarious, would like to hear your account of what transpired in the Northlands.${prompt}
  11004: |-
    ...?
    What is this envelope?${prompt}
  11005: |-
    From Doctor Monberaux?
    Why would he...?${prompt}
  11006: |-
    However, first things first.
    Follow me.${prompt}
  11007: Ah, welcome back, adventurer.${prompt}
  11008: I see that you were unsuccessful in protecting the fourth crystal.${prompt}
  11009: And now it is looking more and more like you are the one who is leading the boy...${prompt}
  11010: Relax, adventurer. I am not blaming you for anything.${prompt}
  11011: Nagmolada kept the secret of the amulet to himself.${prompt}
  11012: It is his foolishness that acted as a catalyst for what occurred in the Northlands.${prompt}
  11013: And now that we know the true identity of the boy, there is no reason to further suspect your nations involvement. I apologize for not trusting you.${prompt}
  11014: However, now we must put aside our misunderstandings and unite to save our world from being destroyed. Will you help us protect the mothercrystals?${prompt}
  11015: |-
    Join forces with Jeuno?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  11016: We have caused you much suffering, and I understand your anger. On behalf of the Duchy I ask for your forgiveness.${prompt}
  11017: ${name-player}...${prompt}
  11018: In the presence of the fourth crystal, I have learned that a strange occurrence took place.${prompt}
  11019: Is it true that the girl you took with you actually helped Selhteus and thwarted the plans of our Nagmolada?${prompt}
  11020: It is extremely important that you do not withhold information from us.${prompt}
  11021: |-
    Is it true?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  11022: |-
    I see...
    The Duchy is currently searching for that girl.${prompt}
  11023: We do not wish to punish her. We feel that she may be in grave danger. We must find her so we can protect her.${prompt}
  11024: The first threat to her will be Nagmolada. He is already attempting to make it seem as if the fall of the fourth crystal was the girls fault.${prompt}
  11025: If he finds her, he will more than likely poison her mind, preventing her from speaking of anything that may harm his plan.${prompt}
  11026: The second threat will be the boy, Selhteus. His next destination will most surely be the fifth and final crystal.${prompt}
  11027: However, this crystal lies deep beneath the sea, and the only one who knows how to reach it is the girl.${prompt}
  11028: Finally, the third threat will consist of assassins from the south.${prompt}
  11029: You may have already heard the rumors of the Mithran sin hunters who have crossed the southern seas to try the theologians of Tavnazia.${prompt}
  11030: These hunters will not give up until they have punished all those they seek.${prompt}
  11031: And that is why we need your help, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11032: If you find the girl, bring her here. No harm will be brought to her. I swear on the name of the Goddess.${prompt}
  11033: Lady Eshantarl!${prompt}
  11034: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Did you tell them everything that happened in the Northlands?${prompt}
  11035: My plan was flawless! If it wasnt for that despicable girl, Prishe, I would have captured Selhteus, and this whole ordeal would be solved!${prompt}
  11036: That girl heard the whisper of Selhteuss soul, sang the “Memoria de la S^tona,” and helped him escape!${prompt}
  11037: The “testament of affinity” she possesses--it connects the hearts and souls of men. Selhteus has been using that to control her!${prompt}
  11038: '...${prompt}'
  11039: But now we have the chance to find out his true intentions.${prompt}
  11040: If we can capture the girl, we can use her to tap into Selhteuss mind. We can learn if he truly arrived to save AlTaieu!${prompt}
  11041: |-
    You miserable man!
    Are you saying Selhteus does not know that our crusade ended long ago?${prompt}
  11042: |-
    You fool!
    Are you saying Selhteus does not know that the celestial capital was destroyed long ago?${prompt}
  11043: Perhaps it is we who do not know the true outcome of the crusade or the true fate of our capital!${prompt}
  11044: I propose that an expedition be sent to AlTaieu.${prompt}
  11045: There we may find the answers to why Selhteus survived all the centuries, and why he continues to poison the mothercrystals.${prompt}
  11046: And that is why we must first investigate the line leading to the fifth crystal.${prompt}
  11047: Please, grant me access to the Crystal Terminal!${prompt}
  11048: |-
    ...
    I understand why you feel an expedition to AlTaieu is necessary.${prompt}
  11049: However...${prompt}
  11050: '${choice: 0}[The Armathrwn Society/Kam''lanaut] has already made a decision on this matter. I seem to recall that you have been given orders to research the Moblin city that was discovered near Bastok.${prompt}'

  11060: Now with the Eye gone and the path to the fifth crystal sealed, how do you plan on dealing with him!?${prompt}
  11061: I dont think you even have a plan!${prompt}
  11062: Very well, let me inform you of how we plan to stop Selhteus.${prompt}
  11063: |-
    We can draw him forth without traveling to the fifth crystal.
    We can seal him without your precious Eye of Altana.${prompt}
  11064: H-how...!?
  11065: You can hear me, can you not...Selhteus?${prompt}
  11066: It is I who possess the other amulet you seek.${prompt}
  11067: |-

    Come and fulfill the pact!${prompt}
  11068: Here, take this envelope back to the doctor. It does not belong to me.${prompt}

    Now that I have passed from the mortal realm, I have only you to turn to.
    The time left to me is short.
  11094: Thirty years ago, I came into contact with the insidious power of this land, and rose from the grave. However, at the same time, this world laid claim to a part of my soul...${prompt}
  11095: |-
    I have been released from the hate that consumed me, but the half of my soul that was taken captive all those years ago is calling to me...
    It has become a towering darkness. A raging hatred, spawned from the depths of my being...${prompt}
  11096: Very soon I will be drawn into that soul. I no longer have the strength to resist. The soul that was divided will become whole once more, and that rage will take on physical form.${prompt}
  11097: A new Shadow Lord will be born. Surely you have sensed the growing evil? The beastman armies that are imprisoned here are massing for battle. They plan a return to the world of their origin, the realm that exists beneath the light of hope.${prompt}
  11098: |-
    My link to you will soon be severed, so listen carefully.
    Thirty years ago, an expeditionary squad formed from the elite soldiers of each nation was sent to investigate the Northlands. You must have seen their memories when you first laid your hand upon the chunks of magicite.${prompt}
  11099: |-
    Seek out the markings that the expedition members left behind. They will aid you in gaining entrance to this world.
    You must defeat the Shadow Lord before our unification is complete.
    My hopes go with you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11100: There is an unusual arrangement of branches here.${prompt}
  11101: There is an unusual arrangement of pebbles here.${prompt}
  11102: The strands of grass here have been tied together.${prompt}
  11103: There is an unusual arrangement of leaves on the ground.${prompt}
  11104: |-
    I see you have met with Raogrimm.
    His soul is no longer confined to that incarnation of rage, the Shadow Lord, yet the fact remains that he has committed sins beyond redemption.${prompt}
  11105: In spite of those sins, I still wish to rescue him from the darkness. I no longer have a mortal body with which to act, and so the most I can do is guide you in my stead.${prompt}
  11106: 'You will need the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, a key that bridges the void between Vana''diel and that other world.${prompt}'
  11107: 'It is said that there are items in this world that gain a soul of their own through contact with the thoughts and dreams of other living creatures. The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is one of those items.${prompt}'
  11108: 'You must look for the Goblin peddlers. They are certain to have knowledge of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. When you have it safely within your grasp, seek out the markings that we left behind...${prompt}'
  11109: That world is a land now draped in the blackest night. We can pass from one world to the other, but without the physical forms lost to us thirty years ago, there is little we can do to intervene.${prompt}
  11110: Raogrimm is the one who... No, the world has been divided into separate realms through the machinations of the new Shadow Lord.${prompt}
  11111: The Shadow Lord resides in the Xarcabard of the other reality. However, I fear you would be marching to your death should you go to confront him... I ask you to first obtain trophies from four of the alternate realms.${prompt}
  11112: We understand that there is little time to spare. But without a certain degree of power, it will be impossible to traverse the land the Shadow Lord holds in thrall. Show me your strength with the four trophies you bring back.${prompt}
  11113: 'Those whose fate is linked to his world will empower the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to guide you...${prompt}'

  11115: 'As part of my penance, I will infuse the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} with what guidance I can.'
  11116: |-
    I betrayed him...
    And now I am needed, the one who cut down poor Cornelia. The man cursed with the brand of traitor...${prompt}
  11117: Sure, I got everything I wanted, but what was left to me in the end? For one rash action, all I gained was an empty title and irreconcilable guilt...${prompt}
  11118: I doubt youll listen to the words of a traitor, but please, help free him from the bonds of his eternal night...
  11119: Our expedition was supposed to have been an allied effortaru, but not one of us was interested in the fate of the other nations. In our hasty-waste to outdo each other, we failed to see to the heart of the mattaru.${prompt}
  11120: |-
    Our attitudes led to the death of two of our members, and precipitated the birth of the Shadow Lord...
    This sin does not belong on Raogrimms shoulders alone. We all mustaru atone for our actions.${prompt}
  11121: Please help him. Help Raogrimm escape from his horrid-worrid darkness, forever this time.
  11122: Humes and Galka have never been the best of friends. I used to think that was just the way it was, and always would be.${prompt}
  11123: I figured Id be causing myself grrrief if I stuck my whiskers into other nations problems. My next catnap was all that mattered to me in those days. Ignorrrance is bliss, as they say.${prompt}
  11124: Responsibility for Raogrimms trrransformation lies with all of us who traveled with him on that expedition. By sharing the blame for the crimes he committed as the Shadow Lord, we can finally call ourselves his trrrue companions.${prompt}
  11125: |-
    Let me help you on your path. May guiding light fill this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!
    Raogrimms fate is in your hands.
  11126: There is a broken branch thrust into the ground here.${prompt}
  11127: There is a symbol carved into the rock here.${prompt}
  11128: I have been waiting for you.${prompt}
  11129: |-
    Do you remember the last words Raogrimm spoke to you? "The link will soon be severed"...
    Do you understand the significance of these words?${prompt}
  11130: |-
    When the soul that was divided is whole once again, towering rage will take on physical form...
    Yes, a new Shadow Lord will be born. Even I will no longer hear his voice.${prompt}
  11131: Even now, I can barely feel the emanations of Raogrimms faltering spirit. When those emanations fade completely, he will be...${prompt}
  11132: The Xarcabard of that other realm is shrouded in a vast darkness, preventing contact from the outside. Even those of us without material bodies are unable to penetrate that mist of eternal night.${prompt}
  11133: "Until that mist clears, I cannot guide you to Xarcabard. \nThe next place you must venture is the twin of Vanadiels Beaucedine. There you will find the last trophy to complete the set of keys we need.${prompt}"
  11134: |-
    You must obtain the last trophy.
    All five trophies combined with our power will create a synergistic force, allowing us to part the shroud for a few precious moments. It will open a path between worlds.${prompt}
  11135: |-
    Take care, my brave adventurer.
    May the blessings of Altana guide and protect you...
  11136: |-
    Even after the blackest night, the golden sun always rises to begin a new morning.
    This troubled land will soon have its dawn...of that I am certain.${prompt}
  11137: |-
    I never thought to walk this land again, not even in death.
    Is this what they call karma...?${prompt}
  11138: |-
    This land has borne the weight of my sins.
    I will not beg for forgiveness, but accept my responsibility...${prompt}
  11139: |-
    So this is the reason for that unspeakable terror I feltaru here when I was still alive. Its possible that the other realm has existed for much longer than anyone ever dreamed...
    Keep your wits aboutaru you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11140: |-
    Im not rrreally fond of touching platitudes.
    Snap Raogrimm to his senses with a big ol smack to the head for me.${prompt}
  11141: |-
    It is time!
    Put an end to this thirty-year nightmare, ${name-player}.
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! Show us the path to Xarcabard!
  11142: Death does not exist in that realm. You might call it a “prison of souls.”${prompt}
  11143: |-
    Even those who fall in battle will rise again after a time as if nothing had happened.
    Like a flame returning to a candle whose light has been extinguished...${prompt}
  11144: It is an endless succession of life and death. How many times has that cycle repeated itself in that damned abode?${prompt}
  11145: There is one thing that bothers me. Whatever happened to the original wielders of the weapons and armor that the beastmen there now possess? If the statues in the shape of Orcs and such were once actual beastmen, then...? But I get carried away with my musings.${prompt}
  11146: |-
    Please pay no mind to my ramblings.
    You have secured the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. An incredible feat. It proves the strength of your conviction, and is one of the keys you will need to enter Xarcabard.${prompt}
  11147: |-
    You will need four such trophies.
    Once you have them within your grasp, make your way to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. Cornelia awaits you there.${prompt}
  11148: I dont know about the other four, but I cant hear his voice anymore...${prompt}
  11149: Is this another brand I must bear for my treachery? I must truly be hated if thats the case.${prompt}
  11150: |-
    It is something I would wish for at the moment, however. I pray this silence is just a continuation of our incompatible personalities.
    If not, then it means his pronouncement has become reality...${prompt}
  11151: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    This is more than just a testament to your strength. It is one of the keys that will lead you to Xarcabard, along with the trophies of the other realms.${prompt}
  11152: |-
    When you have all four trophies, travel to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. You will find Cornelia waiting for you there.
    That is all the wisdom I have left to give you.${prompt}
  11153: |-
    What is the true nature of that other world? I can only explain it as a place that lies beyond the limitarus of our knowledge.
    But Im sure Ive feltaru that aura somewhere before...${prompt}
  11154: Thats it. That protocrystal I came across when I was doing research in Elshimo. The magical emanations coming from the crystal gave me a similar impression. An avatar? No, that cantaru be...${prompt}
  11155: |-
    Oh! Oh, Im terribly-werribly sorry!
    I appear to have driftarued into my old habits.${prompt}
  11156: |-
    Now, ${name-player}.
    This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is both a symbol of your fortitude, and one of the keys that will help you gain access to Xarcabard. The trophies from the other three realms carry the same importance.${prompt}
  11157: Gather all four trophies and hurry yourself on to Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia will be waiting for you when you get there. But be wary, ${name-player}. The blackness enveloping that world grows ever deeper, ever darker...${prompt}
  11158: The beastmen of that world carry the spoils of prrrevious battles. Equipment that you or I would use.${prompt}
  11159: Im not able to touch them in my prrresent form, but I feel something about those weapons and armor...something extrrraordinary.${prompt}
  11160: |-
    Wait, wait, wait!
    I dont mean that theyre currrsed or anything like that! Its something more like, um, not ominous, but...
    How can I explain it?${prompt}
  11161: Anyway! Theyre not evil, just...you know? Different from other normal swords and things. Being all ghostlike and stuff, you can feel things like that.${prompt}
  11162: |-
    But enough of that kinda talk--congrrratulations are in order!
    Youve got your paws on the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}! It shows youve got the goods in the hero department, and it will also help you get into Xarcabard.${prompt}
  11163: But first youve got to collect the other three trophies and then hightail it to snowy Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia should be up there waiting for you.${prompt}
  11164: "${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and the four trophies.\nThese artifacts have long been lost to that other world. \nThe Hydra Corps was a unit formed after our expedition to the Northlands.${prompt}"
  11165: |-
    It must have been in the time of the Great War...
    Nobody knows how the Hydra artifacts came to be there, but those five trophies will open the path for you.${prompt}
  11166: Each of these items holds a measure of power. However, the strength of a single artifact is limited.${prompt}
  11167: |-
    The ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} and the ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.
    Combining these separate entities created a bridge from Vanadiel to the other realms.
    Xarcabard, Im afraid, is another matter entirely...${prompt}
  11168: |-
    Unless the shroud of darkness is lifted, that power alone will not be enough to open the way.
    However, the five trophies resonate with another artifact that lies within his land. If we can join our strength to theirs...${prompt}
  11169: Let us make haste to the land where this all began. To Xarcabard...${prompt}
  11170: Is it over...?${prompt}
  11171: No, the rage has merely been dispersed.${prompt}
  11172: As long as I exist, he will never truly die...${prompt}
  11173: Or perhaps an eternal soul is something beyond the concept of death?${prompt}
  11174: |-
    ${name-player}...
    You have achieved an incredible feat--the unification of the Shadow Lord has been prevented.
    I have not the words to express my gratitude.${prompt}
  11175: |-
    The power of the crystal has faded, but I will be drawn into that towering rage no more.
    I have heard the voice of the one who holds sway over this realm...${prompt}
  11176: The one who holds sway...?${prompt}
  11177: |-
    Yes. From the center of infinite darkness.
    I was in a place beyond comprehension when those words reached into my mind...${prompt}
  11178: |-
    You who have touched the crystal, the one who holds immortal power within a mortal shell.
    The rage that has arisen from your twisted core will devour my world.${prompt}
  11179: |-
    It was an error in judgment to shelter you...
    The order of my realm has been disrupted.${prompt}
  11180: |-
    I give to you a duty...
    You will stand vigil until an age without hatred has dawned.${prompt}
  11181: |-
    No matter what terrible power you might wield, there is no escape from Dynamis for an incomplete soul.
    No return to the land of blessed light...${prompt}
  11182: |-
    What manner of being was this who spoke from a pit of blackness?
    As this question gnawed at my mind, the voice grew quiet, leaving me in unanswered silence.${prompt}
  11183: |-
    Of one thing I was certain.
    This voice belonged to the ruler of Dynamis.${prompt}
  11184: A flow of energy exists in Vanadiel that has escaped the notice of those who dwell there.${prompt}
  11185: |-
    Thirty years past, my contact with the crystal caused an accelerated change in this flow.
    It was as if it had leapt forward, rushing along a deliberate course.${prompt}
  11186: |-
    Nobody knows what lies at the end of this journey.
    Perhaps it will reveal the true nature of Vanadiel.${prompt}
  11187: ${name-player}, you may be the one to witness this truth.${prompt}
  11188: |-
    The power stored in the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will soon be drained.
    And I must remain in this world in my role of observer.${prompt}
  11189: |-
    Do not forget who you are, ${name-player}.
    I bid farewell to a most heroic adventurer.${prompt}
  11190: My old companions...?
  11191: |-
    This duty is too much for just one to bear.
    If you will have me, I will stand at your side until an age without hatred has arrived.
    It pains me to see the depths to which my country has fallen.${prompt}
  11192: That is my only reason for staying. Do not misunderstand my motivations.${prompt}
  11193: |-
    Blessed light and the ruler of Dynamis?
    I do believe youve rekindled my long-forgotten sense of adventure.${prompt}
  11194: |-
    Once Ive gotten all firedy-up, even you cantaru keep me back, Raogrimm.
    Im sure my incomparable research skills will be of use in your task.${prompt}
  11195: |-
    Cmon, lets see a little excitement!
    This is our expeditions thirty-year rrreunion.${prompt}
  11196: |-
    Its not the Northlands this time.
    None of us are going to grow old and die, so who else would you want with you on a task as long as this one?${prompt}
  11197: |-
    Im not gonna back down, no matterrr how much you complain.
    Better just give in and accept the fact that youre stuck with me.${prompt}
  11198: |-
    I thought this would be the end of you for sure...
    Hmph. Youre just as thick-skinned as you used to be.${prompt}
  11199: |-
    What, no words for an old friend?
    Thinking about testing your theory on whether or not a soul can be killed?${prompt}
  11200: |-
    I betrayed you!
    I extinguished the light of your precious Cornelia!
    The man responsible for this entire nightmare stands right before you!${prompt}
  11201: |-
    Everything began thirty years ago.
    And there were things that came to an end...
    Even though I was a prisoner of uncontrollable rage, the fact remains that I took the lives of my companions with my own hands.${prompt}

  11400: |-

  11401: "However, there is little meaning in me keeping it now. \nIf you will wield this weapon for a just cause, I hand its power over to you.${prompt}"

    In my current state, ${item-singular: 0[2]} is nothing more than an ornament, its power going to waste.${prompt}

    I entrust this staff to you!
    Take up ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${name-player}, and bind it to you in a contract of blood!${prompt}

  11419: Ah, one more test of your patience...${prompt}
  11420: Where is this place?${prompt}
  11421: |-
    Of course. How could I forget.
    I am Ghebben. I was entrusted with this bow by a warrior of the Far East.${prompt}

    Your hands tell me that your skill in archery is far from ordinary.
    ${item-singular: 0[2]} will fit snugly into your sure grasp.${prompt}
  11423: |-
    However, this bow belongs to Sir Nasu, the warrior of whom I spoke.
    You must remember that you are merely its keeper for a time.${prompt}
  11424: Farewell...${prompt}
  11425: '...${prompt}'
  11426: |-
    It is an honor to be owned by a just master.

    Whyd you have to go and wake me up? I was having the most relaxing sleep.
    Oh, this place looks familiar...${prompt}
  11432: Hm? You think youre the one whos going to take up my gun?${prompt}
  11433: 'You do seem to have a fair eye for marksmanship. And ${item-singular: 0[2]} would look perfect nestled in the crook of your arm...${prompt}'
  11434: Well, I have no more use for this weapon, so I guess you can have it. But there is one thing I want you to remember.${prompt}
  11435: This gun is a fearsome weapon that unleashes a blast upon your enemies many thousands of times greater in strength than the tiny effort it takes you to pull the trigger. Needless to say, be careful who you aim it at...${prompt}
  11436: '...${prompt}'
  11437: A weapon has no will of its own. But it was made for a purpose.${prompt}
  11438: Take me to a new battlefield, a new arena for the hunt...${prompt}
  11439: |-
    ...
    I am saved.${prompt}
  11440: Silenced for too long in the prison of Dynamis, I can once again let my brazen call echo through this land!${prompt}

  11498: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  11499: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each sides camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  11500: At the beginning of the match, half of each sides Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  11501: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing sides Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  11502: The goal is to steal your opponents Flamme and use them to light your sides Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  11503: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  11504: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  11505: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  11506: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  11507: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  11508: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  11509: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  11510: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  11511: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  11512: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  11513: If you manage to open the opposing teams Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  11514: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing teams Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  11515: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  11516: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  11517: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  11518: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'

  11523: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your teams camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  11524: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}

    ${selection-lines}
    Basic rules.
    About the ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}.
    About ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1}.
    About ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1}.
    About ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1}.
    About area-specific rules.
    About returning to battle.
    About special rules.
    Nothing at the moment.${prompt}
  11871: Ballista is an exercise once used by the San dOrian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word “ballista” means “to throw a stone,” and the game has been a part of Vanadielian military history for centuries.${prompt}
  11872: |-
    The rules are simple.
    Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vanadiel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.${prompt}
  11873: 'Players from both teams must search for ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} that a ${color: 5}Herald${color: 1} has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  11874: 'These ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} into them.${prompt}'
  11875: Finally, a players strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.${prompt}
  11876: '${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the ${color: 5}Quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.${prompt}'
  11877: 'Sometimes a player may find items other than ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}, such as potions. These ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).${prompt}'
  11878: |-
    Players can carry more than one ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them.
    However, players will lose their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} if they:
    (1) Successfully throw them into a rook.
    (2) Leave the area.
    (3) Are knocked out.${prompt}
  11879: 'But don''t forget, a player will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command while in possession of a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. And, players can only use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command if they carry one of the stones.${prompt}'
  11880: As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.${prompt}
  11881: 'All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. This will temporarily increase one''s movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  11882: 'However, remember that once a player has obtained a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, he or she will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. In its place, though, one may use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command.${prompt}'
  11883: 'The locations of the ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.${prompt}'
  11884: 'Communication with one''s team members is, of course, one way to locate ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}. However, another way is by using the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  11885: 'Finally, ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} can only be used when a player is carrying a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. Because ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.${prompt}'
  11886: 'So, a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} has been obtained and a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1} located. Now all that''s left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.${prompt}'
  11887: There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.${prompt}
  11888: 'To throw a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} into a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}, a player must first wait until the ${color: 5}Rook''s${color: 1} gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.${prompt}'
  11889: |-
    But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status.
    Only then will his or her shots count.${prompt}
  11890: This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.${prompt}
  11891: Running about looking for stones is no different from a childs game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.${prompt}
  11892: |-
    The following match types are area-specific:
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands
    Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains${prompt}
  11893: |-
    ${color: 5}Best of Three${color: 1} series rules are as follows:
    Winning a match will earn a nation one “match point.” The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for “come-from-behind” victories.${prompt}
  11894: Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nations forces.${prompt}
  11895: Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.${prompt}
  11896: When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.${prompt}
  11897: For more information on temporary items, refer to the “special rules.”${prompt}
  11898: After being KOd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.${prompt}
  11899: If a player chooses to return to their forces camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.${prompt}
  11900: |-
    Please note that many of the rules previously considered “special” have been fully implemented.
    Also, several new special rules have been added.${prompt}

  11902: 'Previously, participants in Ballista were required to use an item the moment they dug it up using the /quarry command. However, players can now stock these items as ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} for use at any time during the match.${prompt}'
  11903: 'Players can hold up to ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1}, but only one of each type. If a player finds an item that they already possess, they must use it immediately or throw it away.${prompt}'
  11904: 'If players who possess ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} find an item that they have not already obtained, they will also have the option to exchange it with one of their current items.${prompt}'
  11905: Also, players will not, at any time, be allowed to trade temporary items. However, there are items that can be used on other Ballista participants. Please note that players may not be able to use these special items as soon as they are quarried.${prompt}
  11906: 'Finally, the Heralds will collect ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} when the match (the third in a Best of Three series) has concluded.${prompt}'
  11907: 'Ballista Points are rewarded to each competitor based on his or her performance in a single Ballista match. The maximum number of points that can be accumulated per match is ${number: 0}.${prompt}'
  11908: 'While it is taken into consideration, scoring ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} is not the only way to earn Ballista Points. Assisting allies and defeating members of the enemy forces can also earn a high score.${prompt}'
  11909: 'Ballista Points can be traded for special “vouchers,” which may be exchanged for free ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} at the start of new matches.${prompt}'
  11910: |-
    However, remember that depending on the level restriction of the match, certain vouchers will not be redeemed at the beginning of a match.
    Speak with a ${color: 5}Marshal${color: 1} directly after a match to register your points.${prompt}
  11911: 'Players will only be allowed to score up to five ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} at a time. Also, a player''s ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status will be automatically disengaged if a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} is not scored within a certain amount of time. The amount of time is increased for those members of the team currently behind in points.${prompt}'
  11912: 'All allies within a certain radius will achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status when a member of the enemy forces is defeated.${prompt}'
  11913: Players resistance to sleep will be increased.${prompt}
  11914: 'During the entry period, from ${number: 0}:${number-2-digits: 1}, all adventurers will be allowed to join the forces with the smallest number of participants, regardless of allegiance. Open entries will be accepted until both sides have reached maximum capacity.${prompt}'
  11915: |-
    In order to ensure balanced matches, the following level limits are enforced:
    Level 30 matches: 1～30${prompt}
  11916: |-
    Level 40 matches: 31～40
    Level 50 matches: 41～50
    Level 60 matches: 51～60
    Unrestricted matches: 61～${prompt}
  11917: Please note that any participant who cancels his or her registration will not be allowed to re-apply for the same match.${prompt}
  11918: When the total number of participants in a match is less than 40, the location of the two camps will be adjusted. Also in this case, the number of Rooks will be reduced to two.${prompt}
  11919: Any adventurer whose main level is over 30 will receive EXP for participating in a Ballista match. However, no EXP will be rewarded if the adventurer fails to actively take part in the match.${prompt}

  11925: There are four types of chevrons and titles awarded to top-ten players (gold/mythril/silver/bronze), as well as two different types awarded for outstanding performances by players of each of the twenty-two jobs.${prompt}
  11926: Wearing a chevron during a Ballista match will automatically change a players current title. If a player wishes to possess this title after a match as well, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] must contact a certain bard in San dOria.${prompt}
  11927: Also, while wearing a chevron, players will be able to trade Ballista Points for temporary items not available to all players.${prompt}
  11928: However, the rules of Ballista state that players may only possess a certain chevron for no longer than one half Vanadiel year. When that time comes, they are required to return the chevron before being allowed to participate in any further matches.${prompt}

Come back when you think youve got some more seasoning under your belt, kupo...${prompt} 12131: |- Ive discovered a way to increase the potential of those who have reached their “limits.” However, I havent found anyone to pass that method on to, kupo. Hey, you look pretty tough. How would you like to be my guinea...errr, assistant?${prompt} 12132: |- Wait a minute! I remember you! I already filled you in on the secrets of the Moogle Merit Management system, kupo! Stop wasting your time here; get fighting, kupo!${prompt} 12133: |- Become his “assistant”? ${selection-lines}
     Lets do it! No way! Tell me more...${prompt} 12134: |- Excellent, kupo... Ahem! I shall now pass on to you the secrets of the “Moogle Merit Management” system. Use this legendary method to extend your limits. Watch as your strength soars beyond the stars, kupo!${prompt} 12135: Now, when the level of your main job has reached 75 or higher, a new button, “Merit Points,” will appear under “Status” in the main menu.${prompt} 12136: Press this button to change experience accumulation modes as well as adjust skills and attributes.

That didnt work, kupo... I guess I still have some research to do. Well have to put the experiment on hold for a while.${prompt} 12139: |- Huh? What good is an adventurer thats not willing to take on a little adventure? Well, come back to me if you ever change your mind, kupo...${prompt} 12140: |- Been working hard, or hardly working, kupo? Remember that by pressing the “Merit Points” button in the “Status” menu, you can check merit point totals, change experience accumulation modes, and adjust skills and attributes.${prompt} 12141: |- Oho, kupo! Or perhaps youre looking to transcend your limits? Because that could also be arranged...${prompt} 12142: |- Ask about merit points? ${selection-lines}
     Yes. No.${prompt} 12143: |- What will you ask about? ${selection-lines}
     Exceeding your limits. Merit points.

Have you ever stopped to wonder what happens to all the experience you accumulate after maxing out your level?${prompt} 12147: In recent months, I have discovered that this type of experience builds up in your body in a completely different form--a type of super experience, if you will. I have given this phenomenon the name ${color: 5}limit points${color: 1}, kupo!${prompt} 12148: When you accumulate ten thousand of these points, they are magically transformed into an even more super type of experience--super-duper experience, if you will. I call these ultra-special points “merit points,” kupo!${prompt} 12149: But that is not all I have discovered. I think I have also come across a method to manage those points and use them to boost the levels of your body and mind beyond their current limits! I call it “Moogle Merit Management,” kupo!${prompt} 12150: |- I can tell by the look on your face that youre pretty interested, kupo. So, what would you like to know?${prompt} 12151: |- Ask about... ${selection-lines}
     How to accumulate merit points. How to adjust attributes. Nothing at this time.${prompt} 12152: Well, you already know that by reaching level 75 youre ready to start collecting limit points, right, kupo?${prompt} 12153: Well, before you begin, dont forget that you have to press the “Merit Points” button in the “Status” menu.${prompt} 12154: It only appears when your main job is level 75 or higher, kupo.${prompt} 12155: By pressing this button, you can toggle between “experience point accumulation mode” and “limit point accumulation mode,” kupo.${prompt} 12156: In experience point accumulation mode, you will gain normal EXP after every battle until you reach the maximum...${prompt} 12157: ...while in limit point accumulation mode, you will receive limit points after every battle. It's that easy, kupo!${prompt} 12158: Oh, and by the way--if you are still in experience point accumulation mode after youve reached your maximum amount of EXP, any battles fought from that moment on will earn you limit points, regardless of the mode you are in, kupo!${prompt} 12159: Normally, you can only accumulate limit points when youre playing a job that has reached level 75 or higher. However, there is one exception, kupo!${prompt} 12160: When a job capable of receiving limit points has been reduced via a level restriction, you can still earn limit points by defeating enemies!${prompt} 12161: Just dont forget to switch modes before heading out on a hunting trip! When youre in limit point accumulation mode, the color of the text in the “Status” window will change a little to let you know, kupo!${prompt} 12162: Finally, if you level down or switch jobs while in limit point accumulation mode, you will automatically be switched back to experience point accumulation mode.${prompt} 12163: Ah, and one more point of advice: You can always check the amount of limit points and merit points you have earned by viewing the “Merit Point” menu.${prompt}
  11960: Ummm, first of all, you can check the number of merit points you have accumulated by pressing the “Merit Points” button under “Status” in the main menu.${prompt}
  11961: The data I have collected so far tells me that it is quite difficult to raise these attributes, and that there seems to be a limit to the amount any certain attribute can be boosted, kupo.${prompt}
  11962: It also seems that certain attributes and skills are connected in some way. I call these groups “categories.”${prompt}
  11963: 'For example, imagine the attributes in the “HP/MP” category can be raised a ${color: 5}“combination”${color: 1} of seven times, kupo.${prompt}'
  11964: That means if you raise your “Max HP” five times, you can only raise your “Max MP” two times.${prompt}
  11965: In other words, you cannot raise all of the attributes to their limits. The body must maintain a certain balance, or it will explode! Or something like that, kupo.${prompt}
  11966: There is also a way to lower attributes that have been pushed past their limits. Unfortunately, every time this is tried, the merit points used to originally raise that attribute are lost, kupo...${prompt}
  11967: Oh, and finally, there are some attributes and skills in the same category that have different limits. Im still not sure about all of these, so Id suggest asking some of your level 75 buddies for advice, kupo!${prompt}
  11968: |-
    Hrm?

  11970: |-
    I had a feeling thats what youd say, kupo!
    Well, Maat? How about it?${prompt}
  11971: We stand on the cusp of a new era. Its the Goddess-given duty of an old warrior like me to prepare the younger generation to follow in my footsteps. And who better than a young ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] whos met every challenge sent ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] way?${prompt}
  11972: You can say that again, my friend!${prompt}
  11973: No doubt youve heard of the mog tablets--those stone slabs engraved with the timeless wisdom of King Kupofried the Great that have been popping up periodically throughout the land.${prompt}
  11974: |-
    The tablets hold many secrets that we moogles have yet to unravel, kupo.
    Why are our wings purple? Why are our noses red? How can we better assist our adventuring friends?${prompt}
  11975: Why, I was just having a discussion with a friend of mine from the Magian Mooglehood on the very subject... Thats when it hit me on the head like a herd of hecteyes!${prompt}
  11976: What if the ancient moogle arts could be used to augment not only adventurers possessions, but the adventurers themselves, kupo!?${prompt}
  11977: |-
    Using my knowledge of merit points--and drawing upon the martial mastery of Maat here--Ive whipped up a method that just might work!
    What say you, adventurer? Care to be my test subject?${prompt}
  11978: |-
    Course, nobodyd blame you for not trustin the little devil.
    Im not even sure I do. Heh heh heh...${prompt}

    Youll also have to accumulate ${number: 0} merit point${choice-plurality: 0}[/s] to provide the necessary energy to trigger the reaction, kupo.${prompt}
  11983: |-
    Ill be sittin this one out, I fear.
    I may have mastered the martial arts, but I know better than to get mixed up with moogle mumbo-jumbo. Heh heh heh...
    Now go get em!${prompt}
  11984: |-
    Say it aint so, kupo!
    Ah, but it is not a moogles place to question the judgment of an accomplished adventurer such as yourself.
    Come back if you ever have a change of heart.${prompt}

    Yes, you! Over here!${prompt}

    Id call you by your proper name if youd actually tell anyone what it is!
    But nooo, the Magian Mooglehood must ever be shrouded in secrecy, kupo...${prompt}

    All you have to do, my dear adventurer, is stay alive! Easy breezy, wouldnt you say, kupo?${prompt}

  12001: Kupo-ho! It would seem the procedure has gone off precisely as we predicted!${prompt}
  12002: That it has, kupo. I must say, the sheer stamina of these adventurers never ceases to astound me.${prompt}
  12003: |-
    My friend, youve been the perfect test subject...<ahem>...I mean, you are clearly an ideal heir for the powers of the moogle ancients.
    Should our research bear further fruit, you shall be among the first to know!${prompt}

  12007: Yes, the positively esurient expression on your face tells me all I need know.${prompt}
  12008: Is there no point at which your penchant for power will be sated, kupo?${prompt}
  12009: It cannot be easy, walking around as a veritable avatar of avarice and avidity.${prompt}

    Still, Ive taken a liking to your kind, kupo.
    And since you were such a wonderful guinea pig last time, Id be positively elated to experiment upon you again!${prompt}

    That said, I must warn you that Im still working out some of the kinks.
    I can give you no guarantees this time.${prompt}
  12012: That is to say, dont come crying to me if your level of strength ends up plunging precipitously, kupo!${prompt}

    You look in fine fettle, my adventuring friend.
    Go out there and get em! Farewell, kupo!${prompt}
  12050: |-

    Next time youre feeling a little backy-wacked up, you know who to call! Ta-taru!${prompt}
  12051: Rejoice, ${name-player}, for the procedure was a staggering success!${prompt}

    However do you always know when to come here, kupo?${prompt}
  12055: |-
    We inflict upon you progressively more profound pain each time, and still you come back for more.
    Are you perhaps a practitioner of a certain Far Eastern religious discipline?${prompt}
  12056: |-
    Or perhaps you were simply dropped on your head as a child.
    Yes, that seems the more likely answer.${prompt}
  12057: But hey, its your bruised and battered body, not mine, kupo.${prompt}
  12058: Either way, youll be pleased to know that the previous two experiments are going to feel like childs play compared to what we have in store for you this time.${prompt}
  12059: |-

    If you ask me, youre lucky that crazy moogle magic ever worked.
    Id think twice about this if I were you...${prompt}
  12061: So how about it, kupo?${prompt}
  12062: |-
    Test your limits?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course!
    On second thought...${prompt}
  12063: "How did I know youd say that? \nVery well. To power the process this time, well be needing ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]}.${prompt}"
  12064: |-
    And youll need to prime your own physical energies by storing up ${number: 0} merit point${choice-plurality: 0}[/s].
    No exceptions, kupo.${prompt}
  12065: Ive got a bad feeling about this...${prompt}
  12066: |-
    Taking a pass today, are we?
    Fine with me. No fur off my back, kupo.${prompt}
  12067: Phew... Thats a relief.${prompt}
  12068: |-
    ${choice-player-gender}[He/She]'s back!
    Are you ready with the ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 2} merit point${choice-plurality: 2}[/s] that we need?${prompt}
  12069: 'If so, trade the ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to me and we''ll get this show on the road, kupo.${prompt}'
  12070: |-
    Or did you come to hear me talk about merit points?
    Because I can do that too, kupo.${prompt}
  12071: |-
    Im afraid your physical energies are not sufficiently primed.
    Remember, you need ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} and ${number: 2} merit point${choice-plurality: 2}[/s] if you want to test your limits.${prompt}
  12072: |-
    Well, it looks like youre all ready.
    And if youre ready, why, Im more than ready.
    <Ahem>... Yoo-hoooooo, kupoooooo!${prompt}
  12073: |-
    Whats this? Has our guest of honor stood us up?
    For shame, kupo!${prompt}
  12074: |-
    Ah, well. We still have plenty of firepower at our disposal here.
    Lets get the ritual rolling...${prompt}
  12075: |-
    ...Oh, how Ive waited for this day!
    Hah! Yah!${prompt}
  12076: '!?'
  12077: |-
    Ten years. Ten long years I walked through fire and ice, subjected my body and mind to the harshest of trainin'.
    All for the day--the glorious day--when I could settle the score with you. Maat...prepare yourself!${prompt}
  12078: What!? M-me?${prompt}
  12079: |-
    Oh, do forgive me, Mister Degenhard.
    I neglected to notify you that ${name-player} here would be your opponent today.${prompt}
  12080: Maat... I face my battles with honor. The battle garb I wear is proof enough of that.${prompt}
  12081: |-
    I thought you a worthy opponent, and yet you summon me all the way to Jeuno on some cruel jest?
    In all my long years, I have never suffered such dishonor!${prompt}
  12082: |-
    For this, you will get no mercy from me!
    No mercy!!!${prompt}
  12083: |-
    Wait a minute, old friend!
    What is this talk of settling scores? Why, I never--${prompt}
  12084: |-
    Hah! Do not play the fool, Maat!
    It was written plain as day on your letter of challenge.
    “If you think yourself worthy of wearing ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, you must defeat me in single combat!”${prompt}
  12085: |-
    (Whoever could have penned such a preposterous missive?
    Oh, thats right...it was me, kupo!)${prompt}
  12086: |-
    You break your promise, now I break you! Like you break your promise.
    Hieeeeee-yah!${prompt}
  12087: W-wait, Degenhard. This...this is madness!${prompt}
  12088: |-
    Oh, good gracious me, ${name-player}!
    Hes preparing to come at Maat with every technique both in and out of the book, kupo!${prompt}
  12089: |-
    If Maat doesnt unleash his own ultimate moves, hes as good as done for!
    We must help him, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  12090: |-
    Look closely at the two masters, kupo.
    See how they each emit an aura? Thats a sign that a no-holds-barred showdown between techniques of inconceivable power is on the way!${prompt}
  12091: |-
    There are three types of auras, indicating three of the most advanced, awe-inspiring bushin techniques.
    But heres the key, kupo: though they are equal in power, each technique is ascendant over another.${prompt}
  12092: The “Raging Beast” devours the “Silent Wind,” but is quelled by the “Soaring Dragon,” kupo.${prompt}
  12093: The “Silent Wind” swallows up the “Soaring Dragon,” but is quelled by the “Raging Beast,” kupo.${prompt}
  12094: The “Soaring Dragon” devours the “Raging Beast,” but is swallowed up by the “Silent Wind,” kupo.${prompt}
  12095: |-
    We are dealing with two martial arts masters here, kupo.
    An attack from an equal or inferior position will be easily deflected by the opponent.${prompt}
  12096: Only by assuming a position of advantage will the attacker be able to break his opponents defenses!${prompt}
  12097: Now, are you ready, kupo!?${prompt}
  12098: |-
    Ready, kupo!?
    ${selection-lines}
    Heeeeee-yah!!!
    W-wait a minute...!${prompt}
  12099: |-
    I dont know how long I can hold them...

  12100: |-
    Are you two done yappin'?
    Then prepare to die, coward! Hah! Eeeeee-yaaaaaah!${prompt}
  12101: |-

    Ive trained years for this day!${prompt}
  12125: |-
    Thats the spirit!
    Well...now that Ive gotten warmed up, what say we go another round?${prompt}
  12126: |-
    Ahahaha! Taken a few too many blows to the head, I see!
    Hah! If youre so eager to meet your maker, how can I refuse!?
    Heeeeee-yah!${prompt}
  12127: |-
    Whats this? Theyre not done yet, kupo!?
    Oh, ${name-player}, what shall we do!?${prompt}
  12128: '...Urrrgggh.${prompt}'
  12129: |-
    You havent changed a bit, friend.
    All passion, no discipline.${prompt}
  12130: |-
    Now settle down and listen for once.
    Your opponent today isnt me, but this adventurer here.${prompt}
  12131: Preposterous! This rank amateur--?${prompt}
  12132: |-
    This “amateur” seeks to take ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] powers to a new level.
    And for that, ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] and our purple-winged friend here have need of your strength.${prompt}
  12133: |-
    R-ridiculous... So the challenge letter...and the ${item-singular: 0[2]}!
    It was all some moogle farce?${prompt}
  12134: Hee hee, kupo.${prompt}
  12135: (It would seem that this nomad fellow is shrewder than he lets on, kupo.)${prompt}
  12136: |-
    <Ahem> Sorry to keep you waiting, ${name-player}.
    Now that all of our participants are properly warmed up, what say we get things started, kupo?${prompt}
  12137: Everyone! To your positions, kupo!${prompt}
  12138: Now this is the momentaru Ive been waiting for!${prompt}
  12139: '...${prompt}'
  12140: Hm?${prompt}
  12141: Oh dear... Has my moogle magic failed me, kupo?${prompt}
  12142: Oh...!${prompt}
  12143: ${choice-player-gender}[Hes/Shes]...${prompt}
  12144: What indomitable, indefatigable spirit, kupo!${prompt}
  12145: Hm!?${prompt}
  12146: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player} feels a vast wellspring of life energy gush forth from deep within!'
  12147: |-
    Incredible! These adventurers can endure even more punishment than we predicted.
    The Mooglehood will be positively ecstatic to hear of this, kupo!${prompt}
  12148: Hmph. I prefer trainin the old-fashioned way.${prompt}
  12149: |-
    Simply-wimply stupendous!
    I must reportaru my findings at once!${prompt}
  12150: |-
    ${name-player}. That was close. Too close, kupo.
    My moogle magic may have finally reached its limits.
    I can make no promises that next time will go as smoothly...${prompt}
  12151: |-
    But that is a worry for another day.
    Now go forth! A veritable universe of unbounded possibilities awaits you, kupo!${prompt}

  12157: Battle failure part.${prompt}

  12159: |-
    Seems our friends been held up.
    Heh heh heh...${prompt}
  12160: |-
    ${name-player}. I applaud your ardent ambition, but I fear our preparations have been prolonged.
    We await the arrival of a very important visitor from a certain super-secret syndicate, you see...${prompt}
  12161: |-
    Howdy-wowdy-ho! I hear some scruffy moogle was just begging-wegging for me to come by?
    We need to make this quick--a bevy of busty beauties just checked in to Neptunes Spire, and theyre desperataruly in need of my services.${prompt}
  12162: '!?${prompt}'
  12163: '${color-alt: 15}Atori-Tutori winks knowingly in Maat''s direction.'
  12164: |-
    Ahem! I am the “scruffy” moogle who sent for you!
    They say you possess a secret Far Eastern technique that allows adventurers to--how shall we say it?--relieve themselves of their corporeal confines, kupo.${prompt}
  12165: |-
    Yeppers, thats me alrightaru.
    So wheres my victim--I mean, trainee--for today?${prompt}
  12166: |-
    Why, this strapping adventurer right here.
    (Thats your cue, ${name-player}!)${prompt}
  12167: '${color-alt: 15}Atori-Tutori squints his eyes and looks ${name-player} up and down.'
  12168: |-
    Hmm, not bad. Not bad at all!
    You must work outaru!${prompt}
  12169: |-
    ...But wait a minute. Of course!
    Youve grown so strong I scarcely-warcely recognized you!
    Why, I knew greataru things would come of you!${prompt}
  12170: |-
    Very well!
    Youre as good a subject as any for my chic, unique technique.${prompt}
  12171: |-
    But first, a matter of procedure.
    As there may be a few minor risks involved, Ill have to ask you to sign a simple contractaru.
    Do that, and Ill pump up your powers with a minimum of fussy-wuss.${prompt}
  12172: |-
    A contract?
    It couldnt be...${prompt}
  12173: |-
    So whats the good word, ${name-player}?
    Are you ready to sign a contractaru with me and become a magical g--er, a mightier, more majestic adventurer?${prompt}
  12174: |-
    How aboutaru it?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sign me up!
    Maybe lataru.${prompt}
  12175: |-
    Got butterflies in your belly, kupo?
    Ill be hanging out here should you ever have a change of heart.${prompt}
  12176: Oh, ${choice-player-gender}[hell/shell] be back. You can countaru on it.${prompt}
  12177: |-
    Look whos back!
    Well, kupo? Have you decided to take our Tarutaru friend up on his offer?${prompt}
  12178: |-
    What say you, kupo?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sign me up!
    About merit points...
    Goodbye.${prompt}
  12179: |-
    Now thats the answer I was looking for!
    Very well, then! Ill just be needing a few things from you.
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, to startaru. Ah yes, and a healthy-wealthy dose of intestinal fortitude.${prompt}
  12180: |-
    “Intestinal fortitude,” kupo...?
    Thats an awfully ambiguous order, my diminutive friend.${prompt}
  12181: |-
    One would think youd have a bit more imagination in that swollen-wollen head of yours.
    I speak, of course, of the “marinara points” you always requestaru of these adventurers.${prompt}
  12182: |-
    Ah, mouthwatering morsels of select seafood and pasta boiled to perfection...!
    ...Ahem. Do you perhaps speak of “merit” points?${prompt}
  12183: |-
    Hmm? As I was saying, ${number: 0} of those whatchama-pointarus along with the items of which I just spoke.
    Round these up, and our contract is as good as signed--and I wont even need to take your soul.
    Ahem, I mean, well be ready to roll.${prompt}
  12184: |-
    And with that, Im going back to the inn before the vixens vacate!
    Drop a linkshell line to my assistantaru when this ${choice-player-gender}[fellow/lady] is ready, mister moogle man.${prompt}
  12185: Far be it from me to keep you from your destiny, ${name-player}, but this technique the Tarutaru speaks of...${prompt}
  12186: |-
    Ah, but never ye mind...just an old mans worries.
    Trust your heart and follow your own path. It wont lead you astray.${prompt}
  12187: 'To recap, you''ll be needing ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${number: 2} marinara--I mean merit ${choice-plurality: 2}[point/points].${prompt}'
  12188: |-
    Bring these to me, and Ill contact the miniature master.
    Understood, kupo?${prompt}
  12189: |-
    Why yes, that should be everything.
    Now where did I put my linkshell, kupo...?${prompt}
  12190: '...${prompt}'
  12191: |-
    Curses and criminy, late again!
    Does that Tarus disregard for decorum know no bounds!?${prompt}
  12192: |-
    Heh, speak o the devil.
    And dont look now, but hes brought a friend...${prompt}
  12193: 'Hmph! And give me justaru one good reason why your associates won''t help sell my scrumptious ${item-plural: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  12194: |-
    I could give you a thousand-wousand reasons, my dear, but what would be the pointaru?
    The higher-ups would never listen to a second-string flunky like me!${prompt}
  12195: |-
    And would it kill you to try to negotiataru!?
    After all the time youve spent there, surely you know how to deal with those costive-wostive easterners!${prompt}
  12196: |-
    And whats in it for me? Hmmm?
    Why, I dont even like pickles! Yeech!${prompt}
  12197: |-
    Ah, the tragedy of it all!
    Its common knowledge that the pickle-hater misses out on at least eighty percentaru of lifes pleasures!${prompt}
  12198: Ah, but the remaining twenty percent tastes infinitely as sweetaru, untainted by the sour, unsavory flavor of those foul foodstuffs!${prompt}
  12199: |-
    I, for one, am developing an exceedingly unpleasant taste in my mouth just listening to this pointless palaver.
    Is this young lady your assistant, kupo?${prompt}
  12200: |-
    Ah, forgive me.
    This is Chumbawumba, a purveyor of pickle-wickles who--as you can see--is most desperataru to distribute her wares.${prompt}
  12201: |-
    Thats Chamama!
    And Ill have you know that I run a perfectly reputable restaurantaru!${prompt}
  12202: |-
    But my assistant...yes, of course!
    Hows this, Ms. Chulapalooza? You lend me a hand, and Ill see if I cant talky-walky the boss into selling your rancid rations.${prompt}
  12203: |-
    Thats Chamama! And “rancid”...!
    ...W-wait. Youd do that for me?${prompt}
  12204: |-
    Of course, my dear assistant!
    Now step rightaru this way, wont you?${prompt}
  12205: Something about this is tying my sensitive stomach in knots, kupo...${prompt}
  12206: |-
    ${name-player}, listen well. My ancient Eastern technique will trigger a miracu-waculous process inside your body.
    You might feel a bit odd at first, but pay it no mind.${prompt}
  12207: |-
    Incubate it carefully, and then, when the urge calls, I want you to squeeze with all your mightaru!
    Succeed and you will expel the physical embodiment of the profound life energies that lie dormantaru within you.${prompt}
  12208: |-
    Its all in the timing. Ten beats of your heart--ten seconds--should do the trick.
    Discharge it too early and it will disintegrate into dustaru. Wait too long and well have a foul mass as rotten-wotten as Chupawupas pickled rodent tails.${prompt}
  12209: |-
    Hmm? Discharge what? No need to sweataru the details, friend!
    Anyhoodles, as a final step, my lovely-wovely assistant will weigh your, er, evacuated matter.
    I daresay three pickling stones weight would do just perfectly.${prompt}
  12210: |-
    Well, arent you in luck!
    I have a supply of ${item-plural: 0[2]} right here.${prompt}
  12211: |-
    Perfect! Now remember, ${name-player}. Its all in the mind.
    When you make that all-important push, envision something...cutesy-wutesy.
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, for example.${prompt}
  12212: Cutesy-wutesy...?${prompt}
  12213: |-
    I recommend you take a momentaru to catch your breath, ${name-player}.
    When youre ready, just speak to our frizzy-furred friend here, okay?${prompt}
  12214: |-
    Ready?
    ${selection-lines}
    Come again?
    Ready!
    Maybe another time.${prompt}
  12215: |-
    Well, look whos back.
    Ready to give my technique a shot, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  12216: |-
    Splendid!
    I shall signal the start of the procedure, kupo.${prompt}
  12217: |-
    All rightaru, ${name-player}!
    On our moogle friends mark...!${prompt}
  12218: Here we go, kupo!
  12219: |-
    When you get the urge...
    ${selection-lines}
    Push!${prompt}
  12220: '...'
  12221: '...?'
  12222: |-
    ${color-alt: 15}A discolored mass is released from ${name-player}'s body.
    It quickly decomposes and dribbles off....
  12223: |-
    Eew! Stinky-winky, ${name-player}.
    I told you what would happen if you waited too long.${prompt}
  12224: |-
    ${color-alt: 15}Something begins to poke out from ${name-player}'s body.
    It quickly crumbles and dissipates into the air...
  12225: |-
    No, no, ${name-player}! Werent you listening-wistening?
    You must hold it in longer!${prompt}
  12226: '${color-alt: 15}A curious mass is released from ${name-player}''s body...'
  12227: |-
    Well, well...this looks most promising indeed!
    Ms. Picklemonger, the weigh-in!${prompt}
  12228: Thats Cha... Oh, just let me see that already!${prompt}
  12229: |-
    One stone, two.
    Yes, it looks like we have...${prompt}
  12230: |-
    Oh dearie-wearie me.
    Im afraid its just a trifle-wifle too light.${prompt}
  12231: |-
    Lets see, now.
    Heave...ho!${prompt}
  12232: |-
    Oh, heavens no.
    This is simply-wimply too heavy for an exquisitaru lady like myself to carry.${prompt}
  12233: |-
    No, this wont do at all.
    Once more from the beginning!${prompt}
  12234: '${color-alt: 15}The unidentified mass vanishes.'
  12235: Just what was that strange stone, kupo...?${prompt}
  12236: Ugh! I thought this was difficult to do, but its even more difficult to watch!${prompt}
  12237: |-
    Well, ${name-player}?
    Im ready-weady when you are!${prompt}
  12238: |-
    Could it be? Yes, I think it could!
    Three stones weight and not an onz more!${prompt}
  12239: |-
    ${choice-player-gender}[Hes/Shes] done it!
    To think Id live to see the day...${prompt}
  12240: |-
    This sleek oblong shape, this glossy sheen!
    Im simply-wimply smitten!${prompt}
  12241: |-
    And just what is ${name-player} supposed to do now!?
    King Kupofried forbid, you cant expect ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to...eat it!?${prompt}
  12242: |-
    Oh, good heavens no!
    This is where I unleash my final technique, just like so...${prompt}
  12243: '${color-alt: 15}The unidentified mass transformed into a shimmering crystal!'
  12244: |-
    Congratulations, ${name-player}.
    You have tapped into a power that few mortal-wortals have.${prompt}
  12245: 'Atori-Tutori hands the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to ${name-player}.'
  12246: |-
    Keep this stone close at hand for the rest of your days.
    As for the nature of its powers... Ill just leave that to your imagination.${prompt}
  12247: |-
    Are we done here?
    Ive got pecks of pickled rarab tails to sell, and Im not getting any younger!${prompt}
  12248: |-
    Very well. Let it not be said that Atori-Tutori doesnt keep a promise.
    May we meet again, ${name-player}. Ta-taru!${prompt}
  12249: '${color-alt: 15}Atori-Tutori winks knowingly in ${name-player}''s direction.'
  12250: |-
    Whatever is the matter, Maat?
    Youre looking positively pale, kupo...${prompt}
  12251: |-
    Its nothin'. Nothing at all, I say...
    Urgh, I think Ive lost my appetite...${prompt}
  12252: |-
    ${name-player}. Only the terminal trial awaits you now.
    I suspect we shall meet again before long, kupo.${prompt}
  12253: Your level limit is now 95!
  12254: |-
    I have a letter for you here from none other than Atori-Tutori.
    It reads, ahem...${prompt}
  12255: “Howdy, ${name-player}. Hows my favorite indentured servantaru doing these days?${prompt}
  12256: |-
    “Having fun with your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?
    Well, youre in luck, because your master has another treat for you today.${prompt}
  12257: |-
    “First, though, Ill be needing something from you: ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, to be exact.
    Track one down and trade it to our furry friend, here.${prompt}
  12258: |-
    “In return, Ill... Oh, but that would spoil all the fun, wouldnt it?
    Ta-taru for now!”${prompt}
  12259: |-
    A present! How positively fascinating...and frightening.
    Whatever could it be?${prompt}
  12260: And the item he speaks of, kupo...${prompt}
  12261: |-
    Heh heh. This would seem t be a warm-up for your next trial, ${name-player}.
    I reckon youll be able to find what ye seek from any enemy thats at least an even match for ye, if ye know what I mean.${prompt}
  12262: |-
    Anyhow, well be waiting for you here.
    Happy hunting, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  12263: Shall I read Atori-Tutoris letter again, kupo?${prompt}
  12264: |-
    Read the letter?
    ${selection-lines}
    Please do.
    No need.${prompt}
  12265: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...
    Yes, this should do!${prompt}
  12266: Did you face any problems procuring it, kupo?${prompt}
  12267: |-
    Atori-Tutoris been waiting for quite some while, you see.
    He seemed a tad...testy, so do take care.${prompt}
  12268: |-
    There you are, ${name-player}.
    I was starting to think you had--Goddess forbid--forgotten the terms of our contractaru.${prompt}
  12269: |-
    I trust you still have your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?
    Hand it over, if you would.${prompt}
  12270: |-
    Such a lovely shimmer and sheen.
    Yes, I reckon-weckon youre ready to face your ultimate challenge--me.${prompt}
  12271: |-
    Or, how shall I say it...a part of me?
    After all, were I to unleash my full strength, I might mistakenly blastaru you into dust with an errant tap of my pinkie-winkie finger.${prompt}
  12272: |-
    Accept the challenge?
    ${selection-lines}
    But of course!
    Maybe another time.${prompt}
  12273: |-
    Dont tell me youre thinking of reneging on our contract, ${name-player}.
    That would make me mostaru unhappy...and you dont want to see me unhappy.${prompt}
  12274: |-
    I understand. These things take time.
    Friends and family to say farewells to, last will and testament to draftaru...
    Just dont keep me waiting for long.${prompt}
  12275: Are you ready to meet your mak--er, your final challenge, kupo?${prompt}
  12276: |-
    Thats the spiritaru!
    Then prepare yourself and meet me at a suitable venue--Horlais Peak, Waughroon Shrine, Balgas Dais, or QuBia Arena should suffice.${prompt}
  12277: |-
    Toodle-woodles for now, my mangy confrere.
    Dont forget to furnish our friend here with the present I left for ${choice-player-gender}[him/her].${prompt}
  12278: |-
    Consider yourself lucky, kupo!
    Its rare indeed that Atori-Tutori offers to go mano a mano with an adventurer like you.${prompt}
  12279: '...${prompt}'
  12280: |-
    Maat?
    Is something the matter, kupo?${prompt}
  12281: At long last, the time has come...${prompt}
  12282: |-
    I can offer no advice but this, young one.
    Ready yourself in body and mind, and prepare for the fight of your life.${prompt}
  12283: |-
    Kupopopo... What is this oppressively ominous mood?
    No siree, this simply wont do!${prompt}
  12284: |-
    So heres some advice of my own.
    Find yourself some friends to bring to the battle, kupo!${prompt}
  12285: Up to five shouldnt give that overconfident Taru cause to complain...much.${prompt}
  12286: |-
    Oh, and ${name-player}, dont forget this.
    Its a personal present from Atori-Tutori himself!${prompt}
  12287: 'Word has it its energies will be released when paired with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  12288: |-
    Oh, and if youre looking for a lift, I can moogle-magick you to your final showdown in two shakes of a rarabs tail.
    What do you say?${prompt}
  12289: |-
    Where to, kupo?
    ${selection-lines}
    Horlais Peak.
    Waughroon Shrine.
    Balgas Dais.
    QuBia Arena.
    Nowhere yet.${prompt}
  12290: |-
    Is that so?
    Then come back whenever youre ready, kupo.${prompt}
  12291: |-
    Then away you go!
    It was nice knowing you, kupo!${prompt}
  12292: Anyhow, if youre feelin the butterflies before the battle o your life, ${name-player}, why dont you pay ol Degenhard a visit?${prompt}
  12293: |-
    Hah! Yah! Cant ye see Im... Wait a minute.
    I almost didnt recognize ye...${prompt}
  12294: |-
    Looks like someones come a long way since our last meetin'.
    Why dont I give ye somethin that might help in yer training?${prompt}
  12295: |-
    But first, Im gonna need proof that yere ready.
    ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} should do the trick.${prompt}
  12296: |-
    Dont ye give me that face.
    Its trainin'--it aint supposed to be easy!${prompt}
  12297: |-
    Well, looks like someones ready for ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] next challenge.
    As promised, heres somethin for ya.${prompt}
  12298: |-
    Its a present from our friend Chamama.
    As for how its going to help yer trainin', yeve got me...${prompt}
  12299: |-
    Kupopopo...
    Those bumps and bruises...dont tell me you failed, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  12300: |-
    Dont get too down and discouraged. Atori-Tutori is a formidable foe, after all.
    Fortunately, hes supplied me with ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} to spare!${prompt}
  12301: However, I fear I cant offer them for free...${prompt}
  12302: |-
    Atori-Tutori made me promise to exact a payment of ${number: 1} merit point${choice-plurality: 1}[/s] or ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}.
    He says its part and parcel of your training, kupo.${prompt}
  12303: |-
    Why, you already possess ${number: 1} merit point${choice-plurality: 1}[/s], you say!?
    Would you like to use ${choice-plurality: 1}[it/them] right away?${prompt}
  12304: |-
    Spend ${number: 1} merit point${choice-plurality: 1}[/s]?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  12305: Whenever youre ready, Ill be here, kupo!${prompt}
  12306: 'Excellent! ${number: 1} merit point${choice-plurality: 1}[/s] paid, and the deal is done, kupo!${prompt}'
  12307: 'Splendid! ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 2[2]}, and the deal is done, kupo!${prompt}'
  12308: 'As promised, here''s a spare ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} from my stock.${prompt}'
  12309: Will you be heading straight to the showdown?${prompt}
  12310: Kupo-ho? Have we met, kupo?${prompt}
  12311: |-
    Wait... Could it be?
    ${name-player}...?${prompt}
  12312: Yeve done it! Yeve truly done it!${prompt}
  12313: Oh, ${name-player}! I knew all along that if anyone could wipe the smirk off that self-satisfied Tarus face, it would be you!${prompt}
  12314: Though I must confess some curiosity as to the conditions of that “contractaru” you signed, kupo...${prompt}
  12315: Heh... If y must know...${prompt}
  12316: It involves bein woken up at the crack o dawn for sparrin matches after doin a hundred push-ups on your knuckles...${prompt}
  12317: Eatin all the rarab tails delivered to the Tenshodo from one of Atori-Tutoris acquaintances...${prompt}
  12318: Wranglin herds of wild sheep and countin them one by one whenever he cant sleep...${prompt}
  12319: |-
    ...'n much, much worse.
    Sends a shiver through these old bones just thinkin about it...${prompt}
  12320: |-
    Egads, kupo!
    That is a most appalling arrangement indeed!${prompt}
  12321: |-
    Wait a minute.
    How is it that youre privy to all those particulars, Maat?${prompt}
  12322: |-
    Hm!? R-rumors, thats all!
    When yeve been around as long as I have, ye hear a thing or two!${prompt}
  12323: |-
    Anyway, enough talk!
    My daily trainin regimen calls!${prompt}
  12324: |-
    Come now, ${name-player}.
    Its no time for slumping shoulders and sunk spirits.${prompt}
  12325: |-
    After all, Im sure its all part of your training.
    Keep it up, and youll be positively pulsating with power in no time flat!${prompt}
  12326: |-
    You were right, old friend.
    I never thoughtaru ${choice-player-gender}[hed/shed] come this far...${prompt}
  12327: |-
    Thats my ${name-player}.
    In all the time Ive known ${choice-player-gender}[him/her], Ive never once known ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to back down from a challenge.${prompt}
  12328: Why, when I think back to the days when ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] was still a rookie with more ambition n sense...${prompt}
  12329: |-
    ...<Sniff>...
    Thats odd, seems t be some water in my eyes...${prompt}
  12330: Save those tears, Maat.${prompt}
  12331: While ${name-player}'s achievements are admirable indeed, those adventurers who strive to reach the pinnacle of their powers remain few and far between.${prompt}
  12332: |-
    We must not ease up on them.
    For it is in their hands that the fate of our Vanadiel lies...${prompt}
  12333: Your level limit is now 99!
  12334: |-
    Speak of the ${choice-player-gender}[savior/starlet], kupo.
    I just overheard an earful of an engaging exhortation on “${color: 5}job points${color: 1}” and figured it was imperative that I inform you immediately!${prompt}
  12335: Accomplished adventurers such as yourself can accrue these points by progressing prolifically in their professions. But beware, for the road is rockier than anything related to limit points, kupo.${prompt}
  12336: '...However, I''m confident you''ll conquer the cornucopia of crimps and clogs that could block your way to glory.${prompt}'
  12337: |-
    Do you believe you have what it takes?
    ${selection-lines}
    Without a doubt!
    Not at the moment...${prompt}
  12338: |-
    Thats what I wanted to hear, kupo!
    Your sheer determination fairly fills me with a fulgent felicity.${prompt}
  12339: Henceforth, you shall be able to select “Job Points” under the “Status” menu as long as your main job has the reached the resplendent realm of level 99, kupo.${prompt}
  12340: You can fervently fiddle with your faculties there, but only while inhabiting the interior of your Mog House or galavanting about your Mog Garden.${prompt}
  12341: The ${name-npc} casts a strange and slightly unnerving spell upon you.${prompt}
  12342: Hmph, and here I hypothesized you were brimming with boldness and bravery. Well, just talk to me when your gut gives you the go sign, kupo!${prompt}
  12343: Those three stars shining above your head are indescribably inspiring, kupo!${prompt}
  12344: And surely you seek more superlative strength!${prompt}
  12345: |-
    How do you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    Must have more power...
    Im strong enough, thanks.${prompt}
  12346: The trials and tribulations you must tackle are terrifying, kupo. Are you absolutely positive?${prompt}
  12347: |-
    Are you positive?
    ${selection-lines}
    Beyond a doubt.
    Not if its hard...${prompt}
  12348: Then I shall bequeath to you a treasured tool--the master breaker!${prompt}
  12349: With this, you will be able to advance in master levels for jobs you have mastered, kupo.${prompt}
  12350: Only through battling the most boisterous baddies can you increase your master level.${prompt}
  12351: Alas, I fear if you fall, your master level might similarly shrink, kupo.${prompt}
  12352: You can check your current master level via the main menu if your main job is level 99 and you have reached job master status.${prompt}
  12353: Increasing your master level will increase a variety of attributes, so do your best!${prompt}
  12354: I will be waiting here whenever you are ready.${prompt}
  12355: ${name-npc} enchants you with a terrifying force.${prompt}
  12356: |-
    ${name-player}.
    What business do you have here today?
    If you seek Captain Wolfgang, he is currently...${prompt}
  12357: |-
    You are here about the girl, Prishe?
    And the warrant for her arrest?${prompt}
  12358: She presented herself at the palace of her own free will, not so long ago.${prompt}
  12359: Naturally, she was taken into custody, but her demands for an audience with a higher authority are becoming increasingly vocal.${prompt}
  12360: I wonder if Captain Wolfgang will return from his duties any time in the near future...${prompt}
  12361: ${name-player}!${prompt}
  12362: I apologize for interrupting your conversation, but...could you walk with me for a moment?${prompt}
  12363: Why would Prishe surrender herself so easily...?${prompt}
  12364: I have no idea what she could be thinking.${prompt}
  12365: Thank the mercy of Altana that Prishe has escaped any punishment while the Jeunoan government is occupied with other matters.${prompt}
  12366: If we could only use this opportunity to rescue her somehow...${prompt}
  12367: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Lady Ulmia!
  12368: Tenzen!${prompt}
  12369: |-
    I am glad to have found you.
    You have heard of young Lady Prishes predicament?${prompt}
  12370: We need to gather everyone together to unite our actions and plan our next move.${prompt}
  12371: The rest of our friends are waiting in a tavern in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}
  12372: A tavern in Upper Jeuno...?${prompt}
  12373: Aldo has used his influence to secure the establishment for our exclusive use, if only for a short while.${prompt}
  12374: |-
    I will await you on the premises.
    Until then.${prompt}
  12375: What could be the purpose for this meeting being held at the Marble Bridge in Upper Jeuno?${prompt}
  12376: If that Aldo is involved, I am positive it cannot be anything good. Just keep me out of it. If I lose this job, Im through!${prompt}
  12377: ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12378: |-
    I must apologize for my childish behavior.
    I never should have run off in such a flustered state.${prompt}
  12379: I do understand what everyone is saying.${prompt}
  12380: I understand that the Wyrmking, Bahamut, plans to obliterate all the peoples of Vanadiel.${prompt}
  12381: Even with the might of the Jeuno Armada, many more innocent lives will be lost in this conflict if something is not done.${prompt}
  12382: And I do understand that everyone truly wishes to rescue Prishe from her destiny...${prompt}
  12383: |-
    However, it is as Lord Diabolos has said.
    We cannot save both the world and all of her people.${prompt}
  12384: |-
    Lord Diabolos...
    I wonder if he called Prishe into his dreamworld because he knew the truth of her identity--that she is the Keeper of the Apocalypse.${prompt}
  12385: |-
    Was Cardinal Mildaurion also aware of this truth?
    Is that why she gave Prishe that amulet?
    But I still...${prompt}
  12386: ${name-player}, it may be too late at this point, but there is something I must tell you.${prompt}
  12387: When Prishe had collapsed, and her amulet was stolen...${prompt}
  12388: It was only for a second, but Im pretty damn sure.${prompt}
  12389: |-
    The presence I felt when the amulet was stolen...
    It was definitely Miss Mildaurion!${prompt}
  12390: Youre saying that Cardinal Mildaurion took the amulet from you?${prompt}
  12391: |-
    Why would she act in such a manner?
    Did not the cardinal give the amulet to you as a gift?${prompt}
  12392: |-
    Yeah, she did.
    Miss Mildaurion was always watching over me through the amulet.${prompt}
  12393: She was always making sure I wasnt thinking of doing something stupid or getting myself into trouble.${prompt}
  12394: But she needed to take the amulet back.${prompt}
  12395: An old, old friend shed waited a long, long time for had finally returned...${prompt}
  12396: |-
    She apologized to me in her thoughts.
    Said that I would be safe while I was in Jeuno...${prompt}
  12397: But then...${prompt}
  12398: Cardinal Mildaurion would have known that we, the survivors of the Great War, were unable to leave the island...${prompt}
  12399: |-
    She knew, but she did not come to help us.
    She abandoned us to our fate...?${prompt}
  12400: |-
    No, I dont think so.
    Miss Mildaurion left it to me.${prompt}
  12401: Left what to you...?${prompt}
  12402: What was Prishe about to say, I wonder.${prompt}
  12403: |-
    What could Cardinal Mildaurion have entrusted to us?
    Surely not the resurrection of the Twilight God...?${prompt}
  12404: It might be naive of me to believe that you are on my side.${prompt}
  12405: However, I am not willing to give up.${prompt}
  12406: I want to sing of a world where both Vanadiel and all of her people are saved.${prompt}
  12407: Will you dream of such a world alongside me?${prompt}
  12408: |-
    Do you dare to dream?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, Ill fight to the end!
    Reality is not that kind...${prompt}
  12409: Thank you, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  12410: |-
    I am sorry.
    I have asked too much without considering your feelings.${prompt}
  12411: |-
    I will once again go to the Grand Duke Palace.
    Ive not found anyone in town who has information, but Makki-Chebukki and the others have probably tracked down some rumors.${prompt}
  12412: |-
    There must be something we can do to save Prishe...
    There must be someone who knows of the cardinal...${prompt}
  12413: |-
    ${name-player}!
    What are you doing here!?${prompt}
  12414: Have you found some means to stop the Wyrmking, Bahamut?${prompt}
  12415: |-
    The battle will soon begin.
    An airship carrying a group of adventurers was downed in an attack by the wyrms.${prompt}
  12416: We have completed preparations on the warships, and nothing remains to be done.${prompt}
  12417: |-
    Only...
    I dont know if this is good news or bad news to you, but the commander of the Jeunoan Armada, Lady Eshantarl, is nowhere to be found!${prompt}
  12418: |-
    Lord Nagmolada has also disappeared without so much as an escort...
    Dammit! This wouldnt be your doing, would it!?${prompt}
  12419: |-
    Is this your doing?
    ${selection-lines}
    All part of my plan.
    Of course not!${prompt}
  12420: |-
    Please, ${name-player}, this is no time for sarcasm.
    Forgive my wild accusations.${prompt}
  12421: |-
    My apologies.
    You must forgive my wild accusations.${prompt}
  12422: No matter how much one despises senseless bloodshed, there are few who can stand by while their home is burned to the ground.${prompt}
  12423: And so, if it means saving Jeuno from the wyrms, I have no choice but to cooperate with this race of ancients.${prompt}
  12424: |-
    Captain Wolfgang!
    The criminals who escaped with warship zero-three have been identified!${prompt}
  12425: |-
    It appears to be the work of those three Tarutaru!
    We have a witness who overheard them talking about heading to a place they referred to as the “fated land.”${prompt}
  12426: |-
    They took a warship!?
    Is it possible they know where our missing officials have disappeared to!?${prompt}
  12427: |-
    And where is this “fated land” they spoke of!?
    Split up and find some answers!${prompt}
  12428: Where could this “fated land” be? I wouldnt even know where to start looking.${prompt}
  12429: But now that I think of it, I could have sworn I heard that name somewhere before... Where was it...?${prompt}
  12430: |-
    You adventurers are quick to hear the news!
    Lady Eshantarl has returned to us!${prompt}
  12431: The Jeunoan Armada has been authorized to begin an assault on the wyrms!${prompt}
  12432: |-
    We are conducting final flight inspections on all vessels.
    Please keep out of the way and allow the engineers to do their job.${prompt}
  12433: Waaah! <sniff>
  12434: Waaah! <snuffle>
  12435: Waaah! <gurgle>
  12436: |-
    What a racket.
    Those Tarutaru were punished for their crimes of stealing a warship and flying out of Jeuno.${prompt}
  12437: 'They claim they were just following orders, but Lord Nag''molada is also awaiting disciplinary action to be decided by the ${choice: 0}[Armathrwn Society/archduke].${prompt}'
  12438: No matter your position, if you break the law...${prompt}
  12439: Hm? Isnt that lady a friend of yours?${prompt}
  12440: Oh, you three!
  12441: Whatever is the matter?${prompt}
  12442: |-
    Come now, no more tears.
    Surely things are not that bad?${prompt}
  12443: Were done for.${prompt}
  12444: Our necks are on the chopping block.${prompt}
  12445: Weve gotta get out of here!${prompt}
  12446: |-
    Whatever for?
    There are rumors all over town about the brave Tarutaru who saved an important official.${prompt}
  12447: Is there some other terrible failure that you are regretting?${prompt}
  12448: |-
    No, weve done everything right.
    We used the right blend of deceit and betrayal, honey and vinegar...${prompt}
  12449: We bribed the townsfolk, and avoided the authorities...${prompt}
  12450: Weve groomed ourselves into the perfect candidates to become bureaucrats of the future...${prompt}
  12451: They have to run off because I showed up.${prompt}
  12452: Prishe!?${prompt}
  12453: |-
    What the hell is wrong with you!?
    If you keep this up, Im gonna start rethinking my plan to put you in charge of Tavnazia.${prompt}
  12454: |-
    Get yourselves together, or Im gonna kick you into next Watersday!
    You have a responsibility to look out for Ulmia and everyone else in the Marquisate!${prompt}
  12455: Wh-what?${prompt}
  12456: Sorry to fly off without an explanation, Ulmia.${prompt}
  12457: |-
    And you, ${name-player}.
    Thanks for worrying about me.${prompt}
  12458: |-
    Theres not much time, but Ill tell you what I know.
    Get yourselves to the audience chamber.${prompt}
  12459: Prishe...?${prompt}
  12460: |-
    Ah, that energetic young Elvaan girl just entered the audience chamber.
    Hmmm... I thought she had been taken into custody...${prompt}
  12461: With all the preparations for the launch of the armada, there are currently few people remaining in the Grand Palace. I wonder who gave the girl permission to enter...${prompt}
  12462: |-
    Hello, Ulmia.
    Youve been through quite an ordeal.${prompt}
  12463: C-Cardinal Mildaurion...!?${prompt}
  12464: What is going on...?${prompt}
  12465: |-
    I am sorry, Ulmia.
    We dont have time for lengthy explanations.${prompt}
  12466: However, there is one thing that I must tell you.${prompt}
  12467: My true name is Eshantarl.${prompt}
  12468: Ten thousand years ago I was born in AlTaieu, the city that enfolds the fifth mothercrystal.${prompt}
  12469: Nagmolada, and the other members of the Armathrwn Society that now govern Jeuno, are also of an ancient race of people--a race recently awoken from a centuries-long sleep.${prompt}
  12470: |-
    But I am different from the others.
    Through an unusual twist of fate, I was granted immortality.${prompt}
  12471: '!?${prompt}'
  12472: I pledged to use this unending life to bring to fruition the pact made between Selhteus and the terrestrial avatars.${prompt}
  12473: |-
    After the passing of ten thousand years, a child of destiny would be born in the fated land.
    The Keeper of the Apocalypse...the one I have sworn to destroy.${prompt}
  12474: I have spent many years preparing for the coming of the keeper.${prompt}
  12475: It has been an incredibly long journey.${prompt}
  12476: I have traveled to the far reaches of Vanadiel in search of lost secrets...${prompt}
  12477: I have found solace and encouragement in the many encounters I have had along the way...${prompt}
  12478: But then, when I came to a certain place, I was warned:${prompt}
  12479: Destroying the Keeper of the Apocalypse will merely set the darkness free to reincarnate in another body.${prompt}
  12480: To break this cycle, the darkness itself must be obliterated.${prompt}
  12481: It must be erased from the place where all life originates and where all life eventually returns--the mothercrystal.${prompt}
  12482: To fully eradicate the darkness, the Keeper of the Apocalypse must be destroyed not in the form of a human, but in the form of a god.${prompt}
  12483: That is why I conceived a plan to use the Lay of the Immortals to resurrect Promathia.${prompt}
  12484: Resurrection...and destruction...?${prompt}
  12485: But that plan eventually failed.${prompt}
  12486: At the baptismal ceremony, I...${prompt}
  12487: At that time, I was having my strings pulled by the Emptiness inside me.${prompt}
  12488: I lived in the Tavnazian Cathedral since the time of my earliest memories, and believed that the Gates of Paradise must be opened.${prompt}
  12489: But as my bad luck would have it, the Emptiness inside me reacted to the baptismal vessel and was sealed within this magicite.${prompt}
  12490: |-
    My world was tipped upside down.
    I was suddenly able to read peoples thoughts and, just like Cardinal Mildaurion, I never aged another day.${prompt}
  12491: |-
    So that is what happened.
    You were the Keeper of the Apocalypse...${prompt}
  12492: |-
    But things are different now.
    You are no longer the one, are you?${prompt}
  12493: '...${prompt}'
  12494: Are you saying that nothing has changed? What is to happen to Prishe?${prompt}
  12495: Judging by the actions of Bahamut, the keeper is still among us.${prompt}
  12496: But over the last twenty years I have watched over the lands of Vanadiel, I have seen no other possible incarnations...${prompt}
  12497: Bahamut wishes to see me smashed to bits in the form of the Twilight God.${prompt}
  12498: It was Diabolos that let me in on my destiny as the Keeper of the Apocalypse.${prompt}
  12499: It is my fate to be destroyed along with this magicite, and set adrift from the cycle of the mothercrystal.${prompt}
  12500: No! This is too horrible!${prompt}
  12501: |-
    Listen to me, Ulmia.
    Weve come pretty far in this quest.
    Ive already heard four of the verses needed to resurrect the Twilight God.${prompt}
  12502: Once we have the last verse, we can finally stand before Bahamut...!${prompt}
  12503: |-
    Please, Prishe!
    Do you hear what you are saying!?${prompt}
  12504: |-
    How can I let you offer your very existence to Promathia?
    There must be another way...!${prompt}
  12505: |-
    Calm yourself, Ulmia.
    Prishe will not be coming with us.${prompt}
  12506: The last verse of the “Memoria de la S^tona” no longer exists, and there is no weapon left to battle the Twilight God.${prompt}
  12507: Pitting the full force of Jeuno against the wyrms is our only recourse.${prompt}
  12508: There is no other way to save the children of Altana from extinction.${prompt}
  12509: But Miss Mildaurion! What about me?${prompt}
  12510: |-
    Lady Eshantarl!
    The Jeunoan Armada is prepared for battle!${prompt}
  12511: |-
    I must go.
    Beyond the sea of endless clouds.${prompt}
  12512: Cardinal Mildaurion!${prompt}
  12513: |-
    Prishe. Ulmia.
    It is only a matter of time until Jeuno becomes a war zone.${prompt}
  12514: I will prepare an airship for your return to Tavnazia.${prompt}
  12515: Protect that which is most dear to you.${prompt}
  12516: |-
    Dammit!
    Theres no way in hell its ending this way!
    Its time to put it all on the line!${prompt}
  12517: Prishe!?${prompt}
  12518: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Ulmia!${prompt}
  12519: I know you guys can do it!${prompt}
  12520: Youre strong enough now to beat the hell out of me when I become Promathia...${prompt}
  12521: |-
    Listen, there is someone in Selbina who knows the fifth verse.
    Her memory is a little shoddy, though...${prompt}
  12522: Find the fifth verse!${prompt}
  12523: |-
    I need you to do this!
    You hear me!?${prompt}
  12524: |-
    I cannot...!
    Prishe, wait!${prompt}
  12525: Ulmia, I have heard the entire story.${prompt}
  12526: Louverance!?${prompt}
  12527: |-
    This must be the guidance of Altana.
    The girl with a “shoddy memory” in Selbina is well known to me.${prompt}
  12528: |-
    And I also happen to possess the means to revive her past.
    Let us be on our way.${prompt}
  12529: |-
    What?
    Is there a girl in Selbina with a serious case of amnesia?${prompt}
  12530: |-
    How would I know? Im always confined to my post here in Jeuno.
    Youre the adventurer. Why dont you know these things?${prompt}
  12531: Those three Tarutaru brought to Jeuno by Nagmolada have been granted amnesty by Lady Eshantarl.${prompt}
  12532: However, I dont believe they have much of a future here in the Duchy.${prompt}
  12533: 'Once you have angered ${choice: 0}[the Armathrwn Society/the archduke], it would take no less than a miracle to regain ${choice: 0}[their/his] trust.${prompt}'
  12534: |-
    ${name-player}!
    It appears you caught up with the armada.${prompt}
  12535: |-
    I heard the report.
    The attack against Bahamut failed, but we have dealt him a critical blow.${prompt}
  12536: Lady Eshantarl is to join the main fleet and lead our forces in a mass assault.${prompt}
  12537: |-
    She mentioned that she would like to meet with you all before the attack commences.
    You are to meet her for a confidential briefing in the tavern in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}
  12538: |-
    Do not keep Lady Eshantarl waiting.
    May victory in battle be yours.${prompt}
  12539: Captain Wolfgang has asked me to remind you that you are to hurry to the Marble Bridge in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}
  12540: It sounded as if it was urgent. You had best be on your way!${prompt}
  12541: Recently, there have been no signs of Nagmolada or those annoying Tarutaru entering the Grand Duke Palace.${prompt}
  12542: I heard from one of the guards that the Tarutaru were seen riding an airship to Bastok, but as for Nagmolada...${prompt}
  12543: |-
    The palace is often the site for grand banquets that are attended by dignitaries from every nation.
    In times like these, we do our utmost to see that the needs of our important visitors are met.${prompt}
  12544: 'Recently, ${choice: 0}[Lord Nag''molada/Lady Esha''ntarl] has been requesting the oddest things from the palace staff.${prompt}'
  12545: These requests appear to be for objects desired by guests of the Duchy.${prompt}
  12546: These requests appear to be for objects desired by guests of our eminent official.${prompt}
  12547: If the requested items could be found in Jeuno, nay, in the markets of any country, we would endeavor to procure them.${prompt}
  12548: |-
    However, many of these objects are not available for purchase.
    I am in quite a quandary, as you can see.${prompt}
  12549: Perhaps if I were to offer a reward, you would be so kind as to locate these items on my behalf?${prompt}
  12550: |-
    Would you be so kind?
    ${selection-lines}
    Certainly.
    I am afraid not.${prompt}

    My future employment rests in your hands.${prompt}

    My future employment rests in your hands.${prompt}
  12554: Lord Nagmolada often receives guests of all kinds, but I have never before been besieged with such bizarre requests.${prompt}
  12555: This is the first time Lady Eshantarl has ever made such a request of the palace staff. Furthermore, I do believe this is the first time she has personally received guests...${prompt}
  12556: While I am curious to know what kind of guests we are entertaining, a good servant does not intrude on the business of his employer.${prompt}
  12557: |-
    Ah, splendid. It appears you have been successful.
    You have my most heartfelt gratitude.${prompt}
  12558: 'Why would the guests of ${choice: 0}[Lord Nag''molada/Lady Esha''ntarl] be so enchanted with these barbaric objects?${prompt}'
  12559: |-
    Oh dear, but I must watch my manners. Please forgive my indiscretion.
    Here is your reward.${prompt}
  12560: |-
    These items were available at the air travel agency?
    Well, one learns something new every day.
    Your reward, as promised.${prompt}
  12561: |-
    To see an array of such objects rekindles my desire to visit the Far East.
    How aromas of the unknown inspire our imagination!
    Here is your reward.${prompt}
  12562: I am sure any childs eyes would light up at a collection of toys such as this.${prompt}
  12563: |-
    I must admit to being quite interested in these myself.
    One never forgets the joy of ones youth.
    Your reward, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/madame].${prompt}
  12564: |-
    Perhaps this is a gift for the lady of the house?
    These items are not of the highest quality...${prompt}
  12565: |-
    But I must not presume to judge the guests of ${choice: 0}[Lord Nagmolada/Lady Eshantarl].
    Please accept your reward.${prompt}
  12566: |-
    Your assistance is greatly appreciated.
    I am certain ${choice: 0}[Lord Nagmolada/Lady Eshantarl]'s guests will be most satisfied with your efforts.${prompt}
  12567: |-
    ...Emptiness......
    ......Possible weaknesses...
    Hmmm......${prompt}
  12568: Greetings, adventurer. I am Harith, alchemist and member of a certain prestigious society here in Jeuno.${prompt}
  12569: Perchance you have heard of creatures known as the Empty? Currently, other alchemists in the society are working feverishly on methods to manipulate these mysterious beasts.${prompt}
  12570: Would you like me to continue?${prompt}
  12571: |-
    Well...?
    ${selection-lines}
    Please, go on.
    Im busy at the moment.${prompt}
  12572: |-
    I apologize for taking up your valuable time.
    May fortune smile upon you in your journey.${prompt}
  12573: |-
    The Empty are a cold and hollow species--their very existence a void of nothingness.
    They possess no feeling, no will, no purpose... It is this lack of characteristics that makes them powerful, as they have no known weaknesses.${prompt}
  12574: However, deep within their dark shells we have discovered that something does exist--that “something” being a fragment of a memory lost in the pages of time.${prompt}
  12575: If you happen to have the fortune of coming across one of these incomplete memories on your journeys, bring it to me and I shall purify it into a form known as “anima” using the methods discovered by the society.${prompt}
  12576: By studying the various types of memories left by the Empty, we may be able to discover their strengths and weaknesses.${prompt}
  12577: If you happen to have the fortune of coming across one of these incomplete memories on your journeys, bring it to me and I shall purify it into a form known as “anima” using the methods discovered by the society.${prompt}
  12578: |-
    In addition to these memory fragments, we are also collecting ${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 1[2]}, and ${item-plural: 2[2]} to help us better understand how these creatures evolved.
    Worry not, as you will be duly rewarded for any and all contributions.${prompt}
  12579: |-
    Yes...
    This is definitely the memory of one of the Empty--and in quite excellent condition, I must say.${prompt}
  12580: 'I can synthesize it into a concentrated form of anima; however, I will require a small fee of ${number: 0} gil.${prompt}'
  12581: 'You hand Harith the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and ${number: 1} gil.${prompt}'
  12582: |-
    What a remarkable specimen!
    This ${item-singular: 0[2]} may be the key to unlocking the secrets of the Empty!${prompt}
  12583: Here, please accept this as a token of my gratitude.${prompt}
  12584: |-
    I will begin the synthesis right away.
    Please wait a few moments.${prompt}
  12585: Ah, what a heavenly glow!${prompt}
  12586: By throwing this anima back at the Empty, they will temporarily regain a splinter of consciousness. It is during this time that you may be able to find their weaknesses.${prompt}
  12587: 'Greetings, adventurer! My name is Tillecoe, pupil of the great and powerful mage Abdhaljs, and I have been assigned with the management of my master''s greatest creation--${color: 5}Diorama Abdhaljs-Ghelsba${color: 1}.${prompt}'

    Wait just a moment. Let me have a good look at you...${prompt}
  12733: |-
    Yes...
    You may be of some use to me after all.${prompt}
  12734: My name is Venessa. I have traveled from my homeland far to the west to hone my skills under the supervision of the ducal alchemists.${prompt}
  12735: I am currently studying the phenomenon known as the “Emptiness” and how its byproducts can be better utilized in my field.${prompt}
  12736: My recent research has shown that in addition to the variety of creatures that roam the plains of Promyvion, there are a handful of even stronger manifests that dwell deep within towers that loom above the vast expanses of darkness.${prompt}
  12737: |-
    To continue my work, I require fresh remnants of these rare beasts.
    Of course, your efforts will not go unrewarded.${prompt}
  12738: |-
    Will you accept my offer?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course.
    Not today.
    Tell me more.
    Youve lost me.${prompt}
  12739: Then you are wasting my time.${prompt}
  12740: I have told you enough!${prompt}
  12741: Then you are of no use to me. Begone!${prompt}
  12742: Excellent.${prompt}
  12743: According to data collected by the Duchy, there are several different locations around Vanadiel where the Empty thrive. Adventurers have given these realms the name “Promyvion.”${prompt}
  12744: If my hypothesis is correct, I believe there are four types of special remnants--one to coincide with each area. Which area do you wish to investigate?${prompt}
  12745: |-
    Travel to...
    ${selection-lines}
    Nowhere at this time.
    The Spire of Holla.
    The Spire of Dem.
    The Spire of Mea.
    The Spire of Vahzl.${prompt}
  12746: If you have no intentions of assisting me, then stop wasting my time!${prompt}
  12747: |-
    ${choice: 1}[Holla/Dem/Mea/Vahzl], you say?
    Then you will need this ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}
  12748: Wait just a moment... I remember you.${prompt}
  12749: While I appreciate your assistance, I do not have any more censers to aid you on your travels into Promyvion. I must ask you to return at a later date.${prompt}
  12750: 'Yes, I may be able to provide you with another ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} on ${vanatime: 4} (${earthtime: 4} Earth time) and not a day sooner.${prompt}'
  12751: Here, you may have this one, but take care not to lose it. These artifacts are extremely difficult to come by, and I have only a limited supply.${prompt}
  12752: And if you happen to come across one of the rare remnants that I seek, bring it directly to me. Only then will you receive your reward.${prompt}
  12753: What is this? You say you found something that may be of interest?${prompt}
  12754: |-
    Yes... Yes!
    With this I can prove my ability to the society! I am guaranteed a position within their ranks for sure!${prompt}
  12755: |-
    Hm? Your reward? Oh, I do remember promising you something if you succeeded at your mission.
    How about this ${item-singular: 0[2]}? I dont think the society will be missing it.${prompt}
  12756: |-
    Out of my...
    Wait just a moment. You wouldnt happen to have returned because you wish to delve into the depths of Promyvion once more, would you?${prompt}
  12757: |-
    Well?
    ${selection-lines}
    Thats why Im here.
    I was just passing by.${prompt}
  12758: I have neither the time nor patience to be bothered by every ignorant cretin that happens to wander by. Begone!${prompt}
  12759: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Lady Eshantarls ship has returned.${prompt}
  12760: |-
    This is excellent timing.
    I was ordered to find you and ask that you proceed to the Marble Bridge--the tavern in Upper Jeuno.${prompt}
  12761: |-
    My duty here is done.
    I must now journey to each nation and report that the Wyrmking Bahamut no longer poses a threat.${prompt}
  12762: |-
    I hear that this development is all thanks to you and your companions.
    You have the gratitude of all Jeunoans.${prompt}
  12763: |-
    I have awaited your return, ${name-player}.
    You must tell me all that has happened.${prompt}
  12764: After clashing with our army several times, the dragons suddenly broke off their attack and disappeared into the distant clouds.${prompt}
  12765: There were voices raised in support of hunting the wyrms into extinction, but for the moment we have returned to resupply and reconsider our position.${prompt}
  12766: Now that you are here, I can finally be certain.${prompt}
  12767: Am I to assume from your jubilant features that the Keeper of the Apocalypse has been defeated?${prompt}
  12768: |-
    Has the keeper been defeated?
    ${selection-lines}
    Completely.
    Who can say?${prompt}
  12769: |-
    I knew it!
    Bahamut sensed the keepers downfall and pulled his forces out of battle...${prompt}
  12770: |-
    Tell me.
    What momentous events transpired in the Celestial Capital?${prompt}
  12771: On Cape Riverne, the images that flowed into me from Selhteus...${prompt}
  12772: They were of the incomplete Paradise, AlTaieu...${prompt}
  12773: |-
    The people of AlTaieu returned to their deity ten thousand years ago.
    Returned to Promathia...${prompt}
  12774: |-
    “Opening the Gates of Paradise” is a metaphor for restoring the shattered mothercrystal.
    A way to return the world to its original state.${prompt}
  12775: |-
    The world becomes a paradise, and its people ascend to godhood.
    The Dawnmaiden Yvenoile has memories of witnessing the true form of the great goddess Altana.${prompt}
  12776: Yvenoile spoke to me before we parted ways.${prompt}
  12777: She said, “As I gazed upon her perfection, I realized I could not be a part of her. I wondered who I could possibly be.”${prompt}
  12778: That was when she began her research into the race of people.${prompt}
  12779: After shifting her focus to the inexplicable appearance of the Kuluu phenomenon, Yvenoile became aware of the darkness that resided within us all.${prompt}
  12780: Her realization led her to betray the king and his son, and adamantly oppose any plan to open the Gates of Paradise.${prompt}
  12781: She had discovered our origins as the children of Promathia...${prompt}
  12782: But all has not been resolved.${prompt}
  12783: The Emptiness still seethes within the mothercrystals.${prompt}
  12784: And the surviving Zilart yet cling desperately to their shadowy plan of returning to Paradise.${prompt}
  12785: I gave up my life in Tavnazia almost thirty years ago to infiltrate the organization of the newly awakened Zilart.${prompt}
  12786: But I have been unable to stem their vast power on my own.${prompt}
  12787: However, we now have a common enemy in the Emptiness. For a time, the people of this age will require the aid of the ancients.${prompt}
  12788: The ancients, too, will need your continuing help.${prompt}
  12789: Surely the Dawn Maiden has bequeathed something of value to her younger kin.${prompt}
  12790: I will find out what this may be, and speak with Archduke Kamlanaut. He will heed my words.${prompt}
  12791: I shall continue to watch over the world that you and your companions have fought so valiantly to protect.${prompt}
  12792: Now that Nagmolada is gone and the wyrms have ceased their attacks, it is time to remind the Zilart of their true responsibility:${prompt}
  12793: The safety of the mothercrystals and the battle against the Emptiness.${prompt}
  12794: I will continue to monitor their actions as I watch over the world that you and your companions have fought so valiantly to protect.${prompt}
  12795: There is one thing Id like you to keep in mind, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12796: You were able to save the world and her people without sacrificing one or the other.${prompt}
  12797: But do not misunderstand.${prompt}
  12798: This possibility did not always exist.${prompt}
  12799: It was only with the strength and faith of many people that such a path could open before you.${prompt}
  12800: |-
    I have left with the owner of this tavern three rewards that may help you on your adventures.
    Feel free to choose one.${prompt}
  12801: Until our paths cross once more, ${name-player}.${prompt}

    I was thinking about that dragon we fought in Ghelsba.

  12878: |-
    Do you remember the battle we fought with that dragon in Ghelsba?
    What on Vanadiel was a dragon doing there, anyway!?${prompt}
  12879: |-
    About that dragon we fought in Ghelsba...
    Do you think the mirror was feeding it power?${prompt}
  12880: |-
    There should not have been a dragon in Ghelsba.
    Why was it there, I wonder...${prompt}
  12881: |-
    Do you remember that terrible dragon we fought together in Ghelsba?
    It felt as though the power of the mirror had driven it into that frenzied state.${prompt}
  12882: |-
    The encounter we had with the dragon in Ghelsba sure was a close call.
    Im sure glad I showed up when I did.${prompt}
  12883: |-
    Why was that dragon in Ghelsba?
    I hope it doesnt foreshadow something worse...${prompt}
  12884: |-
    I wonder why that dragon we fought was in Ghelsba.
    Was it after the mirror, maybe?${prompt}
  12885: |-
    Do you remember the dragon we fought in Ghelsba?
    Its strange that such a creature would be found there...${prompt}
  12886: |-
    Are there usually dragons in Ghelsba?
    I mean, besides the one we fought...${prompt}
  12887: |-

  12937: It might be distracting, but do you want me to talk during battle?${prompt}
  12938: Do you want me to talk during battle?${prompt}
  12939: Im not that talkative, but do you want me to say what Im doing during battle?${prompt}
  12940: Would you prefer that we kept up communication during battle?${prompt}
  12941: Do you want me to talk during battle?${prompt}

  12949: |-
    Do you need to hear it?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes, I do.
    Not so much.${prompt}
  12950: Fair enough.${prompt}

  12962: |-
    I havent really thought much about jobs.
    What kind of combat style would be good, do you think?${prompt}
  12963: |-
    Jobs?
    Ill try anything once.
    What style of combat do you recommend?${prompt}
  12964: |-
    Im not that interested in jobs.
    Give me a style of combat and Ill stick to that.${prompt}
  12965: |-
    There are so many jobs to choose from.
    Why dont you recommend a style of combat instead?${prompt}
  12966: What combat style could I use that would be helpful to you?${prompt}
  12967: Feel free to go ahead and choose my combat style. I dont mind.${prompt}
  12968: |-
    I can fight in any style, no matter what my job is.
    Do you have any particular style you want me to use?${prompt}
  12969: |-
    No matter the job, I can fight in any style!
    Is there a particular style you recommend?${prompt}
  12970: |-
    Jobs?
    If the style of fighting is the same, the job doesnt matter much to me.
    What kind of combat style do you recommend?${prompt}
  12971: I dont know much about jobs, but can you recommend a combat style for me?${prompt}
  12972: |-
    There are so many jobs to choose from.
    Why dont you recommend a style of combat instead?${prompt}
  12973: You presume to have knowledge on how I should approach combat?${prompt}
  12974: |-
    Hmm.
    Ill give it a shot.${prompt}
  12975: |-
    Right!
    Thats the style for me!${prompt}
  12976: |-
    Hmm.
    Ill try it.${prompt}
  12977: |-
    Okay.
    Ill try that next time I fight.${prompt}
  12978: |-
    Okay then.
    Ill start doing that from next time.${prompt}
  12979: Sounds good! Leave it to me!${prompt}
  12980: Okay, Ill look forward to trying it.${prompt}
  12981: |-
    Okay!
    Sounds like fun!${prompt}
  12982: |-
    Really?
    Okay, Ill try it out.${prompt}
  12983: |-
    Hmmm. Okay!
    Ill do my best!${prompt}
  12984: |-
    Okay.
    Ill try that next time I fight.${prompt}
  12985: |-
    Fine.
    I will try your suggested combat style.${prompt}
  12986: |-
    What?
    You think I should change my headwear?${prompt}
  12987: |-
    My headwear?
    You think its time for a change?${prompt}
  12988: You dont like my headwear?${prompt}
  12989: Are you suggesting a change in headwear?${prompt}
  12990: You want to choose new headwear for me?${prompt}
  12991: |-
    Youre interested in my headwear?
    Sure, I dont mind you coordinating my fashion.${prompt}
  12992: |-
    What? Come on, out with it.
    You think I should change my headwear?${prompt}
  12993: |-
    Huh!?
    You dont like my headwear?
    Should I wear something else?${prompt}
  12994: |-
    Yes?
    You want me to change my headwear?${prompt}
  12995: |-
    What are you staring at?
    Dont you like my headwear?${prompt}
  12996: Are you suggesting a change in headwear?${prompt}
  12997: My headwear collection accounts for all possible battle conditions. Pick one that will meet your needs.${prompt}
  12998: Well, I guess I could wear something else.${prompt}
  12999: Hmm, I suppose a change couldnt hurt.${prompt}
  13000: Ill change it, then.${prompt}
  13001: Very well. Ill find something new.${prompt}
  13002: Thanks. Ill try this one.${prompt}
  13003: Ooh, I like your style!${prompt}
  13004: Okay, Ill change it for you.${prompt}
  13005: |-
    Well, okay.
    A change is as good as a holiday!${prompt}
  13006: Ill try something new, then.${prompt}
  13007: Hmm. Ill see what I can come up with!${prompt}
  13008: Very well. Ill find something new.${prompt}
  13009: Well, well, it seems you have an eye for these things. I shall equip this from now on.${prompt}
  13010: Ill forget you said anything, then.${prompt}
  13011: |-
    Oh?
    Okay.${prompt}
  13012: Well, thats a relief.${prompt}
  13013: Ill stay the way I am, then.${prompt}
  13014: |-
    So I dont need to change it?
    Fashion can be so frustrating...${prompt}
  13015: You like me just the way I am, eh?${prompt}
  13016: Well, thats good to hear.${prompt}
  13017: |-
    Are you sure?
    Well, I guess thats a good thing...${prompt}
  13018: |-
    Oh?
    Alright, then.${prompt}
  13019: |-
    Phew!
    I thought you thought I looked funny or something!${prompt}
  13020: Ill stay the way I am, then.${prompt}
  13021: I own only the best gear, so I dont blame you for being indecisive.${prompt}
  13022: |-
    You lost it?
    Here, take this.${prompt}
  13023: |-
    You lost it?
    Here, take this.${prompt}
  13024: |-

  13029: |-
    You lost it?
    Here, take this.${prompt}
  13030: |-
    You lost it?
    Here, take this.${prompt}
  13031: |-
    You lost it?
    Here, take this.${prompt}
  13032: |-
    You lost it?
    Here, take this.${prompt}
  13033: You lost it? Hmph. Here, take this. But therell be hell to pay if you misplace that one, too.${prompt}
  13034: |-
    I just gave you one!
    Im sorry, but youll have to wait.${prompt}
  13035: |-
    I just gave you one!

  13044: |-
    I just gave you one!
    Im sorry, but youll have to wait.${prompt}
  13045: |-
    I just gave you one!
    You are really trying my patience. Ask me again when Im not so annoyed.${prompt}
  13046: |-
    With all its technology, the Duchy of Jeuno really is an advanced nation.
    I wonder how tall the cranes in Upper Jeuno are.${prompt}
  13047: |-
    Have you ever lit the lamps of Jeuno?
    I once helped illuminate the city all the way from the port to RuLude Gardens!${prompt}
  13048: |-
    Did you know that there are two auction houses in Upper Jeuno?
    Remembering which one is less crowded is nice when you feel like avoiding the crush of people.${prompt}
  13049: |-
    You can find the most amazing things for sale in RuLude Gardens.
    The Mithran flower shop girl definitely keeps her stock fresh!${prompt}
  13050: |-
    Wouldnt heavy rain flood out lower parts of Jeuno?
    An architectural defect like that shouldnt be left unchecked...${prompt}
  13051: |-
    Is that old man over there planning to sit down on that bench or what?
    And they complain about the younger generation being inconsiderate...${prompt}
  13052: |-
    Jeuno is definitely the place for clothes shopping.
    You cant beat Bastok for jewelry, though.${prompt}
  13053: Every time I come here I cant help but think that at least one person mustve fallen off the edge...${prompt}
  13054: |-
    Jeuno would be the perfect place with a nice restaurant.
    Maybe I should go into the culinary business.${prompt}
  13055: |-
    I wonder what kind of meals the archduke eats?
    Do archdukes eat curry...?${prompt}
  13056: |-
    You can find the most amazing things for sale in RuLude Gardens.
    The Mithran flower shop girl definitely keeps her stock fresh!${prompt}
  13057: |-
    My adventurers instinct tells me that a secret weapon sleeps here in Jeuno.
    Most likely the part that would form the main body...${prompt}
  13058: |-
    Apparently, the construction of the cathedral took 120 years to complete.
    A structure like the Chateau dOraguille must take centuries.${prompt}
  13059: |-
    Chateau dOraguille is so huge, I had to start running around to see everything!
    Luckily a nice guard came and gave me a tour of the Bostaunieux Oubliette.${prompt}
  13060: |-
    If you stand by the fountain, some suspicious character will try to engage you in a game of dice.
    I think he has some kind of gambling problem...${prompt}
  13061: Were you aware that the “moat” in “moat carp” refers to the waters surrounding Chateau dOraguille?${prompt}
  13062: |-
    Children in this nation sure have it rough, having to work late into the night and all.
    At least military service isnt compulsory for them anymore.${prompt}
  13063: |-
    A while ago I was tasked with finding a bride for Prince Trion...but it didnt work out.
    I mean, where in Vanadiel am I supposed to find a “slender Tarutaru beauty”?${prompt}
  13064: |-
    The furniture stores in San dOria have the best selection of goods.
    No surprise with the Carpenters Guild so close by.${prompt}
  13065: |-
    How embarrassing...
    I stumbled into the lumber stacked outside the Carpenters Guild and knocked every single one down!${prompt}
  13066: |-
    Bean dishes are wholesome, healthy dishes.
    Blue peas are especially good when youre running low on gil.${prompt}
  13067: |-
    Port San dOria is built on a lake, right?
    What would happen if the waters rose too high...?${prompt}
  13068: Were you aware that the “moat” in “moat carp” refers to the waters surrounding Chateau dOraguille?${prompt}
  13069: |-
    That cathedral... It could easily transform into the head, and--
    A-ahem! Never mind...${prompt}
  13070: Does the water wheel on top of the Metalworks move the water, or does the water spin the wheel...?${prompt}
  13071: |-
    Dont you ever get tired of waiting for the elevator and just feel like jumping down instead?
    No...?${prompt}
  13072: |-
    I just saw a child walking by with an armful of subligaria.
    Bastok is a weird place...${prompt}
  13073: |-
    I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someones younger brother.
    He didnt seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...${prompt}
  13074: |-
    How could anyone eat fish caught in Bastoks rivers?
    I wish there was a way to tell where fish up for auction are taken from.${prompt}
  13075: I never imagined getting my fashion sense criticized would be such a shattering blow to my self-confidence! Who was that girl anyway...${prompt}
  13076: I never get tired of browsing the jewelry and cosmetic stores in Bastok.${prompt}
  13077: I hope Im as energetic as that chipper old guy in Bastok Markets when I get to his age...${prompt}
  13078: |-
    Ive never eaten a treant bulb before.
    What do they taste like?${prompt}
  13079: |-
    Whose job is it to raise the bridge in Port Bastok?
    What if they fall asleep? Will the airship crash into the bridge?${prompt}
  13080: |-
    I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someones younger brother.
    He didnt seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...${prompt}
  13081: The Metalworks is a truly magnificent structure, suitable of serving as the mighty arms that strike down the enemy...${prompt}
  13082: |-
    In Port Windurst, people have opened stores on top of boats in the harbor.
    I wonder if they ever change locations...${prompt}
  13083: |-
    I was walking around town when a huge nut fell out of a tree and bounced off my head.
    You should be careful!${prompt}
  13084: |-
    Windurst truly is a magical nation.
    I was just teleported from Windurst Woods to Windurst Waters in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  13085: |-
    Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars.
    The property prices must be astronomical.${prompt}
  13086: |-
    Windurst is virtually governed by the Star Sibyl alone, right?
    Dont the ordinary citizens mind being sidelined from politics?${prompt}
  13087: Tarutaru residences are built to accommodate even the tallest Elvaans. But why build shelves so high up...?${prompt}
  13088: |-
    Windurst is famous for its hat shop.
    I can never visit the city without popping in at least once to check the latest styles.${prompt}
  13089: |-
    The hat shop in Windurst Waters has hoods with little ears attached on display.
    Are they not for sale?${prompt}
  13090: |-
    The restaurant food in Windurst is prepared by the Culinarians Guild.
    I never miss a chance to indulge in one of their superb dishes.${prompt}
  13091: |-
    There seems to be a lot of water in Windurst.
    What happens if theres a rainstorm and everything floods?
    It wouldnt take much to submerge a wee Tarutaru...${prompt}
  13092: |-
    Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars.
    The property prices must be astronomical.${prompt}
  13093: A large building seems to have been embedded inside the Great Star Tree. I wouldnt be surprised if the leg portion of the secret weapon is concealed within.${prompt}
  13094: When I travel to hot areas, my feet always sweat inside my boots. Then the sand gets in there and it drives me crazy...${prompt}
  13095: |-
    Im ashamed to admit it but...Im hopeless at riding chocobos.
    I have my license, though. Really.${prompt}
  13096: |-
    Hmm.
    I cant think of anything to talk about.${prompt}
  13097: It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.${prompt}
  13098: Because the weather in town is usually either clear or cloudy, theres no need to carry a change of equipment. But since it can be quite unpredictable out in the wilderness, its good to be prepared.${prompt}
  13099: Just between you and me, I obtained my armor here through unconventional methods.${prompt}
  13100: The other day I had to dash to an outpost to avoid being drenched in a sudden downpour.${prompt}
  13101: Do you ever get the urge to just run around like a mad thing when the ground is covered with snow?${prompt}
  13102: |-
    I do so much prefer to speak with you face to face.
    The pearl can be a little impersonal at times.${prompt}
  13103: |-
    Are moogles considered to be beastmen?
    Is there a moogle king? A god of the moogles?${prompt}
  13104: It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.${prompt}
  13105: The other week I went to the Tenshodo to collect a pair of gloves I had ordered, only to discover they were closed for business that day.${prompt}
  13106: |-
    I have to change my shoes as soon as I get home or I cant relax.
    Does anything like that ever happen to you?${prompt}
  13107: |-
    And have you ever worried that the chocobo smell stays with you, even after you dismount?
    Maybe Im being paranoid...${prompt}
  13108: |-
    ...
    Nope, the only thing that comes to mind is the weather.
    Not very interesting at all.${prompt}
  13109: |-
    Do you notice the change?
    I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt}
  13110: Theres nothing I hate more than getting caught outside without the right gear for the weather.${prompt}
  13111: |-
    The range of goods is pretty good if you buy through this method.
    Unfortunately though, some items arent always in stock, so you dont always get what you want.${prompt}
  13112: |-
    The guards wouldnt let me inside, if you can believe it!
    My best dress, ruined!${prompt}
  13113: |-
    But if you run around too much, your shoes get all soggy.
    And nobody likes soggy shoes now, do they?${prompt}
  13114: I like to be able to see what youre thinking.${prompt}
  13115: I wonder what kind of pet a moogle god would keep...${prompt}
  13116: |-
    Do you notice the change?
    I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt}
  13117: Of course, that didnt deter me in the least. I simply seized some of the staff and “persuaded” them to open shop.${prompt}
  13118: No one ever seems to want to swing a huge sword while wearing a tunic or a robe...${prompt}
  13119: Im hopeless at keeping my room tidy, so I bought some furniture to store all my items.${prompt}
  13120: I went to the Blacksmiths Guild the other day to have some armor repaired, but it turned out to be their day off.${prompt}
  13121: Can you tell what kind of equipment Im wearing?${prompt}
  13122: Ive got my eye on some new equipment, but theyre way too expensive.${prompt}
  13123: I appreciate your concern for my equipment and all, but what about your own attire?${prompt}
  13124: |-
    Have you ever seen an aurora?
    It looks like a rainbow-colored curtain draped across the sky.${prompt}
  13125: |-
    I never know what to wear on windy days.
    I mean, you cant wear a skirt, right?${prompt}
  13126: |-
    Ive noticed that beastmen seem to carry gil around.
    What on Vanadiel do they use it for?${prompt}
  13127: |-
    The smilebringers really exist, you know!
    They live somewhere far to the north!${prompt}
  13128: Can you tell what kind of equipment Im wearing?${prompt}
  13129: In the Near East, a race of rat-like beastmen called Qiqirn live alongside common folk. Their information network is said to be impressive.${prompt}
  13130: |-
    I always thought it would look mysterious and unique.
    Maybe I just have no fashion sense...${prompt}
  13131: |-
    For some reason, my Mog House began to feel damp after that.
    Guess I bought too many vases...${prompt}
  13132: |-
    Why does that always happen on the very day you decide to go?
    Call me impatient, but I ended up just buying a new set of armor...${prompt}
  13133: Youre probably thinking that youve seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt}
  13134: But if I wait a little longer, maybe the price will come down. Its pretty normal for items to become cheaper after a while.${prompt}

  13141: |-
    But that reputation doesnt guarantee their information will always be accurate.
    After all, swindling isnt a race-exclusive occupation.${prompt}
  13142: |-
    Youre probably thinking that I have a trunk full of armor.
    I actually trade my old gear in all the time.${prompt}
  13143: Ive been meaning to tell you, but you shouldnt send me any deliveries.${prompt}
  13144: |-
    There are powerful enemies emerging all around us these days.
    We should keep up our training to avoid being overwhelmed in battle.${prompt}
  13145: |-
    Its so much easier to converse while were within the city walls.

  13158: To become strong like that, how many hours a day do you think I should spend leveling?${prompt}
  13159: |-
    M...my Mog House, you ask? Out of the question!
    Its a total mess, with month-old half-eaten scraps...and much worse!${prompt}
  13160: Well, you could at least offer up a topic for conversation occasionally!${prompt}
  13161: |-
    Even though we get so much exercise, I start gaining weight if I eat too much good food.
    Must be a metabolism thing...${prompt}
  13162: |-
    I have as many as four different sets worked out...
    I suppose using them in combat will help me to decide.${prompt}

    Its almostaru time for my patrol, though--Ill let you know if I see her.${prompt}
  13464: Speaking of Mithra, that reminds me of the time one of those wily-smiley felines snuck into the guard post.${prompt}
  13465: |-
    I immediately gave chase, but lost track of the intruder.
    Even though no real harm was done, it still irky-wirks me to be given the slip like that...${prompt}
  13466: |-
    You must excuse me.
    Duty calls.${prompt}
  13467: |-
    Oh yeah, now I remember.
    I used the knitted cap when...${prompt}
  13468: |-
    Intruders!
    Halt!${prompt}
  13469: Haltaru, I say!${prompt}
  13470: I have you now...${prompt}
  13471: Nowhere left to run!${prompt}
  13472: |-
    Waaah!
    Lemme go! I aint done nothin'!${prompt}
  13473: You...youre just a kiddy-wink!?${prompt}
  13474: |-
    Waaah!
    Lemme go, you mean lady!${prompt}
  13475: |-
    Alrightaru, alrightaru.
    Theres no need to get upset...${prompt}
  13476: |-
    It seems Ive made a mistake.
    My apologies.${prompt}
  13477: |-
    Dont hurt me!
    I promise Ill be good!${prompt}
  13478: |-
    Calm down, no ones going to hurtaru you.
    What are you doing out at this latey-wate hour, anyway?
    Be on your way home, child.${prompt}
  13479: |-
    That was quite a performance I put on...
    I wish you couldve seen it.${prompt}
  13480: Let me take a look at that cap.${prompt}
  13481: |-
    I shouldve known!
    Theres a big hole in it!${prompt}
  13482: |-
    Wha...where?
    It mustve been when that guard grabbed me...
    How am I supposed to sell it now?${prompt}
  13483: Shouldnt you be more worried about getting back to your norrrmal self?${prompt}
  13484: Itll be okay--youll see!${prompt}
  13485: Oh, ${name-player}, there you are.${prompt}
  13486: |-
    I have a favor to ask.
    Could you track down and buy ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} without our little friend here noticing?${prompt}
  13487: |-
    Its used when amateurs dabble in costume magic and make a mess of things.
    Hes too prrroud to go out and find some for himself.${prompt}
  13488: |-
    You should be able to purchase ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} from a goods store in Bastok.
    I would really apprrreciate it, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13489: All clear!
  13490: |-
    Were you waiting for me?
    Im sorry, but there was no sign of your Mithran friend.
    You might have better luck in a different partaru of the city.${prompt}
  13491: |-
    ${name-player}, I have been looking for you.
    Come. We have confidential matters to discuss.${prompt}
  13492: I must speak with you regarding the Wyrmking Bahamut.${prompt}
  13493: You may recall him returning to the heavens, but I have received confirmation that he has once again descended upon Cape Riverne.${prompt}
  13494: Judging from the activity of the wyrms remaining in the various regions of Vanadiel, I suspected that they had yet to regain their faith in mankind.${prompt}
  13495: |-
    Most importantly, Tavnazia is in danger.
    Prishe and Ulmia have already been informed. I assume that you will also lend them your aid.${prompt}
  13496: |-
    Help out?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    Not yet.${prompt}
  13497: Then you should head to Cape Riverne. Prishe and Ulmia have probably already departed.${prompt}
  13498: I see you have other matters to attend to. I know that you would not turn your back on Prishe and Ulmia, though.${prompt}
  13499: I am sure we have a little time. Return here when you are ready.${prompt}
  13500: I dont understand. Bahamut is nowhere to be found in Monarch Linn! Weve searched all over the south side...${prompt}
  13501: We must be looking on the wrong side. Lets try again, Prishe.${prompt}
  13502: ${name-player}?
  13503: Im so glad youre here! Nothing could reassure me more than your presence.${prompt}
  13504: A member of the Tavnazian Patrol witnessed Bahamut returning to Cape Riverne with an army of wyrms.${prompt}
  13505: Weve looked all over the south side, but Bahamut is nowhere to be found. Were about to begin searching the north side, now.${prompt}
  13506: It will take a while to search every island, so I think we should split up.${prompt}
  13507: Lets go, Prishe.${prompt}
  13508: Oh ${name-player}, I am simply delighted to see you again!${prompt}
  13509: |-
    Surprised?
    Im a regular girl now, you know! Tehehe!${prompt}
  13510: So, its you. I knew we would meet again, but I must say, this is sooner than I expected.${prompt}
  13511: You have done well, but you are naive to think that your troubles would end so easily.${prompt}
  13512: What are you planning!?${prompt}
  13513: Your friend here held in her body a crystallized form of the Emptiness. You returned it to the mothercrystals, did you not?${prompt}
  13514: '...!'
  13515: I sense the will that embodied the Emptiness. It has yet to awaken into this world, but it is tremendously powerful.${prompt}
  13516: The mothercrystals are already beginning to feel its effects, enveloped in the Emptiness as they are. It is stirring...${prompt}
  13517: My magicite...${prompt}
  13518: Mankind will be annihilated. You have simply delayed the process.${prompt}
  13519: Do you dare to defy fate once again and fight to preserve your lives?${prompt}
  13520: |-
    Defy fate and fight?
    ${selection-lines}
    Fight and live!
    Fate is inevitable.${prompt}
  13521: 'Children of Vana''diel! ${choice: 0}[Stand in defiance/Accept your fate] and perish! Redeem the world as a part of the mothercrystals!'
  13522: You have delayed mankinds extinction yet again...${prompt}
  13523: An age is a mere flicker to a wyrm. However, enough flickers united form a star.${prompt}
  13524: |-
    Children of Vanadiel.
    Unite and form a future in which mankind can survive.
  13525: Lets go home for now, Prishe.${prompt}
  13526: Okay...${prompt}
  13527: ${name-player}, please tell Cardinal Mildaurion about this the next time you are in Jeuno.${prompt}
  13528: The “Star of Tavnazia”... The stone Prishe released when Promathia was defeated...${prompt}
  13529: The children of Vanadiel harbor the Emptiness inside their bodies, even if just a small amount. I envisioned it causing problems before too many thousands of years passed.${prompt}
  13530: However, I never dreamed that we would face such a threat so soon.${prompt}
  13531: We have no choice now but to stop Bahamut.${prompt}
  13532: I have a feeling that he was waiting for you, desiring a confrontation.${prompt}
  13533: Bahamut pays respect to the strong, regardless of stature. It is for that reason he is called the Wyrmking.${prompt}
  13534: |-
    You must gather an army of adventurers and challenge him yet again.
    Show our adversary the strength of mankind!${prompt}
  13535: As for me, I will conduct a thorough investigation of the emanations coming from the mothercrystals. Perhaps I will find something of interest.${prompt}
  13536: If you can unlock all the secrets of Vanadiel, we may meet again. I hope with every fabric of my being that that time will come.${prompt}
  13537: '${name-player} uses ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  13538: '${name-player} uses ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but nothing happens.${prompt}'
  13539: We must make preparations and consult with Cardinal Mildaurion.${prompt}
  13540: |-
    ${name-player}, there is someone I would like you to meet.
    Please come this way...${prompt}
  13541: |-
    I have a fair idea of whats going on.
    Its surprising to find a Zilartian with a level head on her shoulders.${prompt}
  13542: 'There are four mothercrystal locations: the Crag of Holla, the Crag of Dem, the Crag of Mea, and the ruins of Pso''Xja.${prompt}'
  13543: Our investigation into the Emptiness surrounding these locations has produced some unusual readings.${prompt}
  13544: We put together a research team equipped with the latest weapons--weapons designed to combat the Emptiness--and sent them to PsoXja.${prompt}
  13545: And you wouldnt guess who they encountered...${prompt}
  13546: |-
    The ruins of PsoXja are under Tenshodo authority.
    Technically speaking, your researchers were trespassing.${prompt}
  13547: Verena had wandered down there like she was being guided by something.${prompt}
  13548: I found this at the place to where I was drawn.${prompt}
  13549: Apparently it belonged to a Galka known as Raogrimm--Im sure you remember the name.${prompt}
  13550: |-
    Verena was once the receptacle for the memories of the Shadow Lord.
    This must be the reason behind her behavior.${prompt}
  13551: Similar readings have been recorded from the Emptiness found below the crags of Holla, Dem, and Mea.${prompt}
  13552: |-
    We have marked the points where the fluctuations were the strongest.
    I would like to entrust the investigation of these areas to you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13553: If my intuition on what lies out there is correct, you will make some fascinating discoveries indeed.${prompt}
  13554: |-
    Youre a brave soul, ${name-player}.
    Youll never catch me in that awful place again.
    Once is more than enough...${prompt}
  13555: |-
    Please be careful.
    Well be praying for your safe return.${prompt}
  13556: So these are what were causing such unusual activity within the Emptiness.${prompt}
  13557: I can feel the aura of those who returned to the mothercrystals...${prompt}
  13558: Nagmolada, Ealdnarche, and even Archduke Kamlanaut...${prompt}
  13559: Could it be possible that these entities are attempting to break back into this world?${prompt}
  13560: |-
    Will they return as they once were?
    Or as something more sinister?${prompt}
  13561: |-
    ${name-player}.
    We must put a stop to this.${prompt}
  13562: These reincarnations are beings that have chosen--and been chosen by--the Emptiness.${prompt}
  13563: |-
    Go. Prepare yourself for battle, then return to me here.
    Let us raise the curtain on the final conflict.${prompt}
  13564: I fear their powers will be beyond any race that has walked Vanadiel.${prompt}
  13565: You hand the three crystal slivers to Eshantarl.${prompt}
  13566: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Let us discuss what needs to be done.${prompt}
  13567: I have returned from an audience with the Wyrmking.${prompt}
  13568: If the Keeper of the Apocalypse is indeed attempting to cross over into this world, there is but one option left to us.${prompt}
  13569: |-
    We force the keeper to appear on our terms.
    Then we crush him.${prompt}
  13570: This was Prishes original plan.${prompt}
  13571: Ulmia will sing the Lay of the Immortals in the presence of the fifth mothercrystal.${prompt}
  13572: |-
    The time has finally come to use the completed song--the verses you discovered on your journey.
    I have faith that Ulmia can perform the piece with little trouble.${prompt}
  13573: |-
    Make your way to the Sealions Den in Tavnazia.
    AlTaieu beckons once again.${prompt}
  13574: ${name-player}, I have awaited your arrival.${prompt}
  13575: It is my fault that this terrible thing is occurring--I have no excuses.${prompt}
  13576: I always feared that my act of relinquishing the Star of Tavnazia...${prompt}
  13577: '...would one day bring the world back to the brink of destruction.${prompt}'
  13578: |-
    But to be completely honest, I am overjoyed that this darkness has given us another chance to meet.
    Truly, I am...${prompt}
  13579: |-
    Prishe!
    You stop this nonsense at once!${prompt}
  13580: |-
    Why must you insist on playing the clown at a time like this!?
    You truly are incorrigible!${prompt}
  13581: |-
    Aw, cmon, Ulmia!
    Its been so long since Ive seen ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13582: A normal reunion would be kinda boring, and I just wanted to spice things up a little...${prompt}
  13583: You were just trying to cover up your own awkwardness!${prompt}
  13584: Thats...not...true...${prompt}
  13585: 'Oh! Hey, there''s the ${choice: 0}[/Ultra /Hyper /Psycho /Eternal /Neo /Lovely /Pretty /Final /Extra /Deadly /Savage /Aero /Pseudo /Universal /Exciting /Celestial /Super /Mighty /Mega /Omni /Poly ]${choice: 1}[/Terror /Perfect /Royale /Gorgeous /Pretty /Hell /Fantasy /Stealth /Powerful /Invincible /Explosive /Storm /Fantastic /Duper /Go-Go /Morphing /Retro /Sonic /Cloud /Sky /Stellar ]${choice: 2}[/Hyper /Neo /Lovely /Happy /Caller /Hound /XI /Armored /Brutal /Buster /Alpha /Chief /Provoker /Mincer /Streak /King /Prince /Power /Robo /Delver /Mystic ]${choice: 3}[C.I.D./Enterprise/Nautilus/Gilgamemnon/Redwing/Blackjack/Falcon/Highwind/Ragnarok/Hilda Garde/Prima Vista/Red Rose/Fahrenheit]!${prompt}'
  13586: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Cardinal Mildaurion will be joining us later.
    Let us begin our journey to the fifth mothercrystal.${prompt}
  13587: |-
    Our mission will be a success.
    I know it in my heart.${prompt}
  13588: Prishe, Ulmia, ${name-player}!
  13589: |-
    You seem surprised.
    Well, our last parting of ways did seem somewhat final.${prompt}
  13590: But you couldnt expect us to stay at home shivering in our fur when word of this rrreached us!${prompt}
  13591: |-
    As the...Moblins say...
    “Dont leave...a hole...half...dug...”${prompt}
  13592: Are we digging holes?
  13593: For the graves?${prompt}
  13594: Not very optimistic, are we!${prompt}
  13595: |-
    I never thought I would don this armor again.
    Cardinal Mildaurion is not one to be ignored.${prompt}
  13596: |-
    Wow, the whole gangs here.
    All because of my selfish mistake...${prompt}
  13597: |-
    My apologies...${wait-36: 1}
    And my thanks!${wait-animation: 4}
  13598: |-
    The time has come.
    On to the mothercrystal!${prompt}
  13599: |-
    Hehehe.
    I always wanted to come back to this place.
    Yknow, for a picnic or something.${prompt}
  13600: Still making unrealistic wishes, Prishe?
  13601: |-
    Miss Mildaurion!
    Aldo!?
  13602: |-
    Im sure you all know Zeid.
    We have a debt to the ancients that needs to be repaid.${prompt}
  13603: |-
    I will also fight alongside you.
    I must see this matter put to rest.${prompt}
  13604: Here they come!
  13605: Bound together...
  13606: By the crystals...
  13607: We will soon...
  13608: Become one...
  13609: Theres something else...!
  13610: A fifth person!?${prompt}
  13611: Lion!?
  13612: Hahaha!
  13613: The stone she would not relinquish...!
  13614: It has been shattered by your song...!
  13615: Our divine transformation is at hand!
  13616: This ends now!
  13617: Leave Nagmolada to me!
  13618: You shall be the first...!${prompt}
  13619: The first to taste the vengeance of the dead!${prompt}
  13620: I think were done here.${prompt}
  13621: |-
    Yes, the battle is over.
    There is only...${prompt}
  13622: |-
    She appears to be unharmed.
    There is some trace of Emptiness, but it will cause nothing more than a few bad dreams.${prompt}
  13623: |-
    Thank Altana...
    It was Lion who leaped into the crystal to save us all.${prompt}
  13624: Her struggle with Ealdnarche continued within the stone...${prompt}
  13625: Lets get her home to Norg...${prompt}
  13626: |-
    Your red hair...
    Now I know you.${prompt}
  13627: |-
    The nightmare I had...
    You were the one who carried it on for me.${prompt}
  13628: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Make sure you fulfill your promise when she gets better, okay?${prompt}
  13629: The world only grows larger the longer we live. New lives are born, and new lands are discovered. Therere always new adventures to be had.${prompt}
  13630: |-
    But you dont gotta rush in, you know?
    This big world of ours will always be waiting.${prompt}
  13631: Waiting for you.${prompt}
  13632: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player}''s badge flashes brightly.${prompt}'
  13633: The Near East must be in a dire condition to send mercenary recruiters all the way to Jeuno...${prompt}
  13634: I heard many tales of the Great War from my dear departed father. They all seemed irrelevant to me until now...${prompt}
  13635: |-
    I see youve got a Salaheems Sentinel badge there...
    They must be desperate to use those as an attention-grabbing device.${prompt}
  13636: Maybe the empress of Aht Urhgan is short on devoted subjects...${prompt}
  13637: Hm? I see you have one of those brass badges that Salaheems Sentinels are handing out unauthorized. Let me take a look at it.${prompt}
  13638: |-
    Interesting. Objects from the Near East seem to shine with a different light.
    Ive heard that the president of Salaheems Sentinels is quite tight-fisted, but at least this badge is quite luxurious.${prompt}
  13639: |-
    Near Eastern cuisine is all the rage now.
    Lately Ive been studying up on it to add some spice to the palace banquets.${prompt}
  13640: Near Eastern cooking is considered one of the leading cuisines in Vanadiel, so I am sure the archduke will be most pleased.${prompt}
  13641: Lately, the Empire of Aht Urhgan has been building up her army. Thats sure to make waves internationally...${prompt}
  13642: Do you think we can continue to preserve friendly relations with all three Majorité nations as the balance of power hangs by a thread?${prompt}
  13643: |-
    You have gathered here today at the request of the Kingdom of San dOria.
    I thank you on behalf of the king.${prompt}
  13644: |-
    This is the first time in history that an emergency summit of this nature has taken place.
    The issue I lay before you is beyond the scope of a single nation...${prompt}
  13645: |-
    Prince Pieuje!
    The adventurer you have permitted to attend the summit has arrived.${prompt}
  13646: Thank you for coming, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13647: Allow me to begin by explaining the events that have led to todays meeting.${prompt}
  13648: It began when ${name-player}, mercenary and adventurer, arrived at the gate of the Chateau dOraguille bearing a letter of extreme importance.${prompt}
  13649: The contents of that letter prompted me to call the nations together...${prompt}
  13650: It was penned by a sage known as Raillefal, and described in painstaking detail the current state of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  13651: This is the same nation that has the port in a frenzy over mercenary recruitment...?${prompt}
  13652: |-
    The very same.
    I speak of the Near Eastern nation, the Empire of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  13653: The Empire!?${prompt}
  13654: Aht Urhgan is now under pressure from three separate beastman armies, and Al Zahbi, the mighty capital itself, is in danger of falling.${prompt}
  13655: Great Altana...${prompt}
  13656: The Silent Empire...${prompt}
  13657: It was once called that.${prompt}
  13658: You may have been too young to know this, Your Highness, but the rest of us should remember.${prompt}
  13659: '...${prompt}'
  13660: I am aware of the term.${prompt}
  13661: In the time of the Great War, the Empire possessed an army greater than the combined forces of the allied nations.${prompt}
  13662: Yet not a single soldier was sent in response to calls for aid...${prompt}
  13663: |-
    My apologies.
    You are well versed in history.${prompt}
  13664: But knowing this, you should also know that we have no obligation to lift even a finger for Aht Urhgan, no matter how serious her predicament.${prompt}
  13665: |-
    Why, Volker, always so calm and cool.
    Youve grown hot and bothered, and your speech is most cruel.${prompt}
  13666: You should understand, Doctor Shantotto.${prompt}
  13667: |-
    You were there on that battlefield.
    Who knows how much suffering couldve been avoided if wed had the help of the Empire...${prompt}
  13668: |-
    On the contrary, my dear musketeer.
    We owe them more than you can imagine, I fear.${prompt}
  13669: What do you mean!?${prompt}
  13670: Aht Urhgan has taken many countries under her yoke...${prompt}
  13671: A ferocious nation that has even bared fangs at the Far Eastern folk.${prompt}
  13672: |-
    Calling the Empire to help in our cause,
    would be like freeing us from demons in return for dragon jaws.${prompt}
  13673: That may be true, but even the close relationship Aht Urhgan had with Tavnazia...${prompt}
  13674: That subject is not--${prompt}
  13675: |-
    ...the issue here, I know.
    Doctor Shantotto, why did Windurst open Mhauras port to the Empire?${prompt}
  13676: My nations actions are none of your concern.${prompt}
  13677: At least we have a backbone--when will Bastok learn...?${prompt}
  13678: You go too far, Doctor Shantotto...${prompt}
  13679: |-
    Enough!
    I did not call you here to speak of possible troop contributions.${prompt}
  13680: Then why are we here, Your Highness?${prompt}
  13681: Our main concern is the treasure thought to be at the center of this conflict--the Astral Candescence.${prompt}
  13682: “Astral Candescence”?${prompt}
  13683: It is described as some manner of musical instrument, but apparently is much more than that.${prompt}
  13684: This instrument is said to produce a phenomenon known as the “Astral Wind,” a breeze that blows from an unidentifiable source.${prompt}
  13685: It creates a melody in a timbre unheard by mortal ears...${prompt}
  13686: |-
    Im confused.
    How can there be a melody if nothing can be heard...?${prompt}
  13687: Astral Wind...${prompt}
  13688: Hmph. This is all very unusual, but Im sure weve all seen stranger things before.${prompt}
  13689: An unidentifiable source...${prompt}
  13690: |-
    In Windurst there is no shortage of magical gadgets.
    Pens that write by themselves. Brooms that sweep on command...${prompt}
  13691: A breeze...${prompt}
  13692: |-
    I mean, they even have that Cardian band.
    Thats similar, dont you think, Doctor Shantotto?${prompt}
  13693: Astral...${prompt}
  13694: Wind...${prompt}
  13695: |-
    Doctor Shantotto?
    Is everything alright?${prompt}
  13696: '!!!${prompt}'
  13697: Ohohohoho!${prompt}
  13698: |-
    If its automatic instruments you need,
    our children make such things before they learn how to read!${prompt}
  13699: The problem lies in the power of the wind.${prompt}
  13700: The wind?${prompt}
  13701: |-
    It envelops those close by, and fills them with a mysterious strength.
    There are few who can resist the lure of this energy.${prompt}
  13702: Even among the beastmen...${prompt}
  13703: If the instrument is that dangerous, why not just give it to the beastmen, or smash it out of hand?${prompt}
  13704: |-
    That is what common sense would tell us.
    If it were up to an individual, or even an entire town...${prompt}
  13705: What are you trying to say?${prompt}
  13706: What if that decision lay in the hands of a nation?${prompt}
  13707: Even if it posed a threat to your own citizens, if that treasure could one day be your salvation, would you not choose to protect it?${prompt}
  13708: How could a mere instrument hold that kind of power...?${prompt}
  13709: The sage who composed this letter is afraid...${prompt}
  13710: Afraid that this Astral Candescence will one day be the catalyst for a conflict to rival the Crystal War.${prompt}
  13711: No!${prompt}
  13712: |-
    Prince Pieuje...
    As a representative for an entire nation, you would do well not to throw those words around so lightly!${prompt}
  13713: |-
    My apologies.
    This is merely based on the conjecture of a sage.${prompt}
  13714: Why dont we have ${name-player}, who has seen and heard these things in person, give us ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] account?${prompt}
  13715: '...${prompt}'
  13716: We cannot make a decision based on this tale alone.${prompt}
  13717: A nation has a responsibility to maintain soldiers and weaponry for the defense of its people.${prompt}
  13718: And for a city in this situation, I would go so far as to say that some sort of secret weapon is almost a necessity.${prompt}
  13719: In any case, it doesnt seem that this Astral Candescence presents any immediate danger to the people of Al Zahbi.${prompt}
  13720: |-
    I wouldnt say that was entirely true,
    if you were me, and I were you.${prompt}
  13721: |-
    ${name-player}.
    I came to a conclusion after you left the chateau.${prompt}
  13722: I wish to hear your honest opinion.${prompt}
  13723: |-
    Give Pieuje your honest opinion?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  13724: |-
    Excellent. I knew asking you here was the right decision.
    I rely upon your vast experience as an adventurer.${prompt}
  13725: Ahaha. Only an adventurer would choose to jest in such company as this.${prompt}
  13726: What is the Astral Candescence?${prompt}
  13727: If it is such an important treasure, then why not secret it away inside the palace instead of placing it in the area most vulnerable to beastman attacks?${prompt}
  13728: I sense some hidden purpose for this dangerous object...${prompt}
  13729: Do you have any thoughts on the matter, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13730: |-
    Any thoughts?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sage Walahra...
    The Gordeus...
    The Walahra Philosophy...
    Not really...${prompt}
  13731: |-
    ${name-player}.
    If you have nothing to contribute, then there is little point in you being here...${prompt}
  13732: |-
    Sage Walahra?
    What manner of person is this?${prompt}
  13733: '...I see.${prompt}'
  13734: The father of the Walahra Philosophy and an alchemist of great renown...${prompt}
  13735: “I, alone, do not possess all the answers. Let us ponder the mysteries of the universe together.”${prompt}
  13736: “Shared knowledge is the shortest path to enlightenment...”${prompt}
  13737: |-
    Hmm.
    Not a philosophy that would appeal to my brother...${prompt}
  13738: Is Prince Trion somehow involved...?${prompt}
  13739: Ah, forgive me. I was merely thinking aloud...${prompt}
  13740: |-
    The “Gordeus.”
    I have heard this name somewhere before...${prompt}
  13741: What manner of person is this?${prompt}
  13742: Not a person? So, it is a holy relic enshrined in Walahra Temple...${prompt}
  13743: In the distant past, Sage Walahra once unraveled the Gordeus and grasped the fundamental principle of existence...${prompt}
  13744: And now a host of like-minded scholars toil day and night to discover the same loose thread to unravel the Gordeus for themselves.${prompt}
  13745: It appears the people of the Empire search for quite different truths than the ones we seek...${prompt}
  13746: |-
    The Walahra Philosophy?
    What manner of learning is this?${prompt}
  13747: What connection does this philosophy have to the Astral Candescence?${prompt}
  13748: “From the void all things are born. To the void all things return.”${prompt}
  13749: I do not understand what this “void” they speak of refers to.${prompt}
  13750: Though this philosophy is not so far from our own belief that all life begins and ends with Great Altana and the mothercrystals...${prompt}
  13751: |-
    Ohohoho!
    Too much time in the cathedral for Destins little boy!
    The mind is a tool you must sharpen, not a childs toy!${prompt}
  13752: Do you mock me, Doctor Shantotto!?${prompt}
  13753: |-
    You look for your answers in all the wrong places.
    Shall I bring a little hope to your long, dreary faces?${prompt}
  13754: What are you hiding, Shantotto?${prompt}
  13755: The servants of Walahra control the Hall of Binding--the treasures little nest.${prompt}
  13756: The Hall of Binding is defended by the Serpent Generals--the best of the best!${prompt}
  13757: |-
    The Serpent Generals?
    A name I have heard. Each one is said to be worth a thousand soldiers.${prompt}
  13758: The Astral Candescence is strictly monitored by the Walahra Temple, according to the adventurers speech...${prompt}
  13759: But the treasure is kept in an area that the beastmen can easily reach.${prompt}
  13760: And there we find the Serpent Generals, the strongest of the strong...${prompt}
  13761: Plus mercenaries like ${name-player} to help them, if Im not wrong?${prompt}
  13762: Yes, there does seem to be some contradiction to be found here.${prompt}
  13763: You see...${prompt}
  13764: |-
    This is a huge game of “set the trap and wait.”
    And the Astral Candescence is the very tasty bait!${prompt}
  13765: '...!${prompt}'
  13766: |-
    Of course!
    Why didnt I see it?${prompt}
  13767: |-
    But wait.
    This creates a whole new set of questions.
    Why would they want the beastmen in the city?${prompt}
  13768: |-
    There are some things that even I cannot divine.
    Its time to sit back and wait for a sign.${prompt}
  13769: But it does seem that this problem lies at the center of some grand plan.${prompt}
  13770: Without concern for the people of Al Zahbi...${prompt}
  13771: We need more information.${prompt}
  13772: |-
    Yes.
    An individual of keen wits and sharp senses...${prompt}
  13773: My lords, I have a suggestion.${prompt}
  13774: ${name-player} is employed as a mercenary in the Empire.${prompt}
  13775: 'However, ${choice: 0}[she/he] is a distinguished adventurer, who will not sell ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] principles for a bag of gil.${prompt}'
  13776: I point to the safe delivery of the sages letter as proof of ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] dedication.${prompt}
  13777: A long journey without promise of reward.${prompt}
  13778: And I am sure that all of you present have had numerous beneficial dealings with adventurers.${prompt}
  13779: They have earned our trust and respect!${prompt}
  13780: That is why I put forth the motion that we have ${name-player} return to the Empire and fight as a mercenary.${prompt}
  13781: We cannot allow any more blood to be spilled by beastmen, even should that blood belong to another nations people.${prompt}
  13782: And if ${name-player} can improve ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] standing enough to bring ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] closer to the Imperial palace...${prompt}
  13783: We may learn the ultimate goal of the Empire.${prompt}
  13784: |-
    Youll find no argument here.
    Adventurers have been the quiet heroes in many of Bastoks darker moments.${prompt}
  13785: |-
    An idea that creates less work for us,
    will not find me making a needless fuss!${prompt}
  13786: How does the Duchy of Jeuno stand on this?${prompt}
  13787: In agreement.${prompt}
  13788: The linking of our auction house services has strengthened the ties between Jeuno and the Empire, but economical matters are superseded by politics...${prompt}
  13789: All in favor...?${prompt}
  13790: |-
    One moment.
    As Raillefal warned, this problem is not likely to remain constrained within the borders of the Near East.${prompt}
  13791: All the lands of Vanadiel, including our four nations...${prompt}
  13792: “Urhguum” is the word for “world” in the language of Aht Urhgan, and this lurking threat could plunge it entirely into chaos.${prompt}
  13793: |-
    We lay this mission before you, ${name-player}.
    Will you consent to take up this burden?${prompt}
  13794: |-
    Take up the burden?
    ${selection-lines}
    Thats what Im here for!
    What am I, a donkey?${prompt}
  13795: You have our thanks, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13796: Naturally, we will do all in our power to aid you in this task.${prompt}
  13797: It is a trifling amount, but perhaps you might use this Aht Urhgan coin on your travels.${prompt}
  13798: An adventurer is free to choose ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] own path...${prompt}
  13799: |-
    However, what I ask of you is for the sake of all Vanadiel.
    I am sure that when the time comes, I can rely on you to perform your duty.${prompt}
  13800: That treasure is more than simple bait...${prompt}
  13801: An astral relic can and will seal your fate.${prompt}
  13802: |-
    The Empress goes too far in her game.
    Im curious to see how it turns out, all the same...${prompt}

  13826: Now I shall move to Northern San dOria.${prompt}
  13827: And last, but not least, let me mark your map for Port San dOria.${prompt}
  13828: I shall start with Port Bastok and its magnificent drawbridge.${prompt}
  13829: Now let me move on to the mercantile metropolis known as the Bastok Markets.${prompt}
  13830: And after the markets, come the massive Bastok Mines.${prompt}
  13831: And finally, who could forget the marveled Bastok Metalworks, where masterful minds from across the Republic meet to mull over the mysteries of man-made mechanical marvels.${prompt}
  13832: Let me start with the Windurst Waters.${prompt}
  13833: Let me continue by marking your map of Windurst Walls.${prompt}
  13834: And while I am at it, let me see your map of Heavens Tower.${prompt}
  13835: Next, I shall mark your map of Windurst Woods.${prompt}
  13836: And finally, let me mark your map of Port Windurst.${prompt}
  13837: I shall begin by marking the important locations on your map of the RuLude Gardens.${prompt}
  13838: Next, let me mark your map of Upper Jeuno. Did you know that I often frequent the Marble Bridge whenever I have a free moment? Theres just something about the name of that model establishment...${prompt}
  13839: Now let me mark your map of Lower Jeuno.${prompt}
  13840: And finally, I shall mark your map of Port Jeuno.${prompt}

    <Huff>...Youre about to enter the council?
    Glad to see you made it in time.${prompt}
  13843: Right, then! This way to the meeting room!${prompt}
  13844: But before you go in, why dont you take a few moments to gather your thoughts?${prompt}
  13845: I mean, theyve been going at this for hours--I doubt theyll miss you a couple minutes more.${prompt}
  13846: '　　 ${wait-animation: 1}'
  13847: As Ive already stated numerous times, it is in our best interests to prevent the completion of the Empires secret weapon, this “iron colossus” of theirs.${prompt}
  13848: Bastok is prepared to employ military action to accomplish this goal--without your support, if necessary.${prompt}
  13849: |-
    I am in full agreement with the captain in this case.
    The Empires intentions are clear--we must not lose this race.${prompt}
  13850: But if we mobilize our forces, we will be giving the Grand Vizier and his supporters just the ammunition they need to fuel a full-scale war.${prompt}
  13851: The Empress yet retains loyal subjects within Her realm. I believe we can still avoid open confrontation.${prompt}
  13852: |-
    Ohohoho...so unlike you, my dear prince.
    Your sentimental view of the situation is making me wince.${prompt}
  13853: If Im not mistaken, Your Highness, wasnt it one of your agents that described the Empresss position as little more than a puppet on the throne?${prompt}
  13854: I...${prompt}
  13855: This will be a conflict of epic proportions. Perhaps we should strive harder for a diplomatic solution...${prompt}
  13856: While I agree with you in theory, we walk a dangerous line.${prompt}
  13857: Despite its state of constant warfare, the sprawling Empire commands staggering resources. If we fail to make the first move, we could face casualties on the scale of the Great War.${prompt}
  13858: |-
    The Great War? Surely you jest?
    The carnage from this apocalypse will be far greater than all the rest.${prompt}
  13859: Worse than the Great War?${prompt}
  13860: |-
    You all know of the Gordeus, I presume?
    It is best were all aware of this potential source of doom.${prompt}
  13861: One does not lightly forget such an object...${prompt}
  13862: You speak of the sacred artifact kept within the Walahra Temple?${prompt}
  13863: An amazing creation worthy of mention.${prompt}
  13864: But that is not the phenomenon to which I wish to draw your attention.${prompt}
  13865: I refer to an event from nine hundred years before...${prompt}
  13866: The supernova that was born from the earth and stole the night sky for an entire year, as was passed down in lore.${prompt}
  13867: |-
    Ah, now this I recall from my lessons!
    This was the miracle bestowed by the Goddess that marked the beginning of the Crystal Era.${prompt}
  13868: After the glare finally faded, this star of the first magnitude became part of the Alexander constellation, correct?${prompt}
  13869: |-
    It was merely a coincidence that the supernovas trajectory passed in front of that star.
    The truth of the matter is more fascinating by far.${prompt}
  13870: The trajectory? I dont understand.${prompt}
  13871: I discovered an ancient papyrus in the extensive vaults of the Optistery.${prompt}
  13872: The following was written in a script bold and flowery:${prompt}
  13873: “When the light deity clashed with the dark, rent in twain were the heavens, and devastated was the earth by a storm beyond comprehension.”${prompt}
  13874: |-
    I must admit to feeling a degree of shock,
    for this simple passage described the arrival of Ragnarok...${prompt}
  13875: |-
    Ragnarok...
    The northern legend that tells of the twilight of the gods?
    You mean to tell us that this supernova was in fact the aftermath of a battle between divinities?${prompt}
  13876: |-
    Oh, so close to the mark.
    Shall I endeavor to bring you out of the dark?${prompt}
  13877: This is my hypothesis based on the facts at hand...${prompt}
  13878: The old Empire of Aht Urhgan launched their iron colossus, imbued with the spirit of the light deity, high into the air, and attempted to dominate the entire land.${prompt}
  13879: |-
    The nation that revered a rival deity was unsurprisingly not amused.
    They sent up their Dark Rider born from sacrifice and with utter darkness infused.${prompt}
  13880: A fierce battle raged in the skies, and eventually both combatants fell to earth--the giant in pieces, and the rider with grave wounds to his material form.${prompt}
  13881: But this titanic struggle had blasted the land into ruin, and left a void in the heavens that spawned a cataclysmic storm...${prompt}
  13882: An apocalypse...${prompt}
  13883: |-
    What a ridiculous story.
    How could an iron colossus be made to fly?${prompt}
  13884: And what does this have to do with the name of the Gordeus?${prompt}
  13885: |-
    We Tarutaru have always been notoriously fussy about our cuisine.
    The name was probably heard from a trader in foreign goods, is what I mean.${prompt}
  13886: The name of the colossuss heart, given to a star...${prompt}
  13887: We have let ourselves be distracted by the candescences. The Gordeus should have been our true concern.${prompt}
  13888: |-
    We can only hope that the Grand Vizier has failed to notice the true value of the treasure under his nose.
    We must hurry to bring this matter to a close.${prompt}
  13889: |-
    Naji reporting in!
    Ive brought ${name-player} back with me!${prompt}
  13890: Youre late. Where in Altanas name have you been!?${prompt}
  13891: Take it easy, Ayame.${prompt}
  13892: |-
    ${name-player}, we are grateful you could come.
    Your insight will be invaluable.${prompt}
  13893: Please, describe to us your impressions of the events unfolding in the Empire...${prompt}
  13894: Thanks to your talents, gaining the program data we needed was far less complicated than expected.${prompt}
  13895: But the Empress appears to have only a tentative hold on consciousness...${prompt}
  13896: It is nothing to be concerned about. When reading someones memories with my altered...perspective...it occasionally releases images and thoughts sealed deep within the mind.${prompt}
  13897: |-
    This state of regression is only temporary.
    She will recover in time...${prompt}
  13898: Let us begin.${prompt}
  13899: So...this day has finally come.${prompt}
  13900: That voice!${prompt}
  13901: If it isnt Nashmeira, then who...?${prompt}
  13902: I know not who you are, but it appears you have completed construction of Alzadaal and unraveled the Gordeus.${prompt}
  13903: |-
    Congratulations are in order!
    You will soon hold the most awe-inspiring weapon in Urhguum in the palm of your hand--the power of light.${prompt}
  13904: Father...!?${prompt}
  13905: But the power of Alexander is a double-edged sword.${prompt}
  13906: Mother!${prompt}
  13907: |-
    The infinite energy of a star...
    The legends--not to mention the ruins--speak eloquently of the destruction that will befall should you make a single misstep.${prompt}
  13908: |-
    It is not too late.
    If you possess a shred of compassion, you will halt the program immediately.
    We hope you choose the wiser course...${prompt}
  13909: |-
    Hmph...a cunning trick, Nashmeira.
    Defiant until the last.${prompt}
  13910: '...${prompt}'
  13911: '!!!'
  13912: |-
    Behold!
    This is the will of Alexander!${prompt}
  13913: |-
    I fear no legend or signs of past failures.
    I will carve out my own destiny.${prompt}
  13914: '...?${prompt}'
  13915: O-Ovjang...?${prompt}
  13916: Mnejing!?${prompt}
  13917: No...
  13918: Noooooo...!!!
  13919: '...${prompt}'
  13920: |-
    Thank you, ${name-player}.
    I am sure we all felt the immediacy of your experiences.${prompt}
  13921: And if we can believe the words of the Grand Vizier, a war with the Empire seems inevitable.${prompt}
  13922: Im afraid I have to agree with you...${prompt}
  13923: |-
    Then, a war it shall be.
    Preparations must be made with all urgency.${prompt}
  13924: |-
    Bastoks armada is ready to sail.
    Once I give the order, the seas will be ours.${prompt}
  13925: Are we committed?${prompt}
  13926: |-
    Ohohoho.
    Our amphibious cardian advance units were already given the order to deploy.
    They lay hidden in the Wajaom Woodlands, primed and waiting to destroy.${prompt}
  13927: |-
    Already deployed...?
    Was the decision of this council a forgone conclusion?${prompt}
  13928: '...${prompt}'
  13929: N-now hold on a minute!${prompt}
  13930: '!!!${prompt}'
  13931: From what I could gather from ${name-player}'s explanation, this Luzaf character wants to prevent Ragnarok as much as we do.${prompt}
  13932: Naji! Remember your station!${prompt}
  13933: And the Empress is of the same mind...isnt that right, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13934: The way I see it, theres no need to go head-to-head with the Empires forces.${prompt}
  13935: If we can spirit Luzaf out of their clutches, then we can at least put a stop to this Ragnarok business.${prompt}
  13936: We might even get a chance to restore authority to the Empress while were at it.${prompt}
  13937: Ayame, ${name-player}...weve all been to Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  13938: Weve seen the lives, the smiles, the tears of her people...${prompt}
  13939: |-
    The citizens of the Empire are as much the children of Altana as we are.
    War should be considered only after every other avenue has been exhausted.${prompt}
  13940: Naji...${prompt}
  13941: |-
    Ohohohohoho.
    A voice of reason from Bastok, the nation of mines and gloom?${prompt}

  13956: Looking forward to working with you, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  13957: Excellent. I will have Pherimociel prepare your transportation at once.${prompt}

    Ill go over the mission again for your sake--I have the details memorized, of course.${prompt}
  13996: The Endymion will touch down in the waters of the Sicklemoon Straits, and well travel north under the cover of darkness. Once we reach the coast of the Wajaom Woodlands, our ground team will disembark.${prompt}

    I find it hard to believe that anyone could knock the Endymion out of the sky so easily.
    There must be some mistake...${prompt}
  14013: |-
    The entire port is rushing to prepare the allied airship fleet to avenge the crew of the Endymion.

    Thats a shame, because your partner was rather enthusiastic about this. Wont you spare just a moment to listen to my proposal?${prompt}

  14043: So basically, to help me with my project, all I ask is for you to report to me the details of your daily activities together, no matter how insignificant they may be.${prompt}
  14044: It may seem trivial, but this is the kind of information that allows writers to most faithfully and accurately portray their subject.${prompt}
  14045: For instance, you could tell me about a trip you two embarked on to, say, Qufim Island, or how you thought that teamwork in battle was especially good on a particular day. Anything at all.${prompt}

    Why, only the most awesome, amazing artifact in the annals of moogle history, thats what, kupo!${prompt}
  14122: Theres eleven of them in all, to be exact, scattered to the far reaches of Vanadiel and just waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers like you!${prompt}
  14123: |-
    What happens if you find them? I thought youd never ask, kupo!
    Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!${prompt}
  14124: |-
    We explorer moogles have made it our lifes work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers.
    But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we cant do it alone, kupo!${prompt}
  14125: |-
    There! Ive whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me.
    Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!${prompt}
  14126: |-
    Just sit right back and Ill tell you the tale, kupo.
    Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom.
    It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!${prompt}
  14127: The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!${prompt}
  14128: |-
    In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign.
    Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.${prompt}
  14129: Sadly, the kindly kings intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...${prompt}
  14130: |-
    King Kupofried was greatly dismayed.
    How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?${prompt}
  14131: In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.${prompt}
  14132: “Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo,” he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.${prompt}
  14133: |-
    Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin.
    A tragic tale, dont you think, kupo?${prompt}
  14134: |-
    We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarchs unrealized dream to fruition.
    We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!${prompt}
  14135: |-

    Good work.${prompt}
  14199: |-
    Youll be pleased to know that the Duchy has also agreed to give its consent.
    Here are the relevant papers.${prompt}
  14200: |-
    I trust youll see that this matter ends well for all of us, ${name-player}.
    Now youd best be on your way.${prompt}
  14201: You there. Yes, you, adventurer! Your downcast countenance tells me your life wants for exhilaration.${prompt}
  14202: 'Who am I, you ask? Let''s just say I''m he who is about to banish all trace of tedium from your life with an irresistible offer--one of otherworldly proportions, to be sure. For a mere ${number: 1} gil, this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} I hold is yours.${prompt}'
  14203: |-
    “But what in Slumbering Samwells shank does it do,” you ask?
    Consider yourself fortunate, for its my policy to demystify before the customer buys.${prompt}
  14204: |-
    What will you do?
    ${selection-lines}
    Let him ramble.
    Purchase ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.
    Learn how to use it.
    Discard abyssite.
    Leave.${prompt}
  14205: Ahem! Allow me to present you with a supposition.${prompt}
  14206: Lying in parallel to the world upon which we stand exists another dimension.${prompt}
  14207: |-
    “Abyssea” is its name--or at least, the name Ive bestowed upon it.
    It is a world of boundless beauty, mystique, and riches unclaimed.${prompt}
  14208: |-
    Now, suppose this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} I hold is a key to accessing Abyssea.
    Were you in possession of one, your curiosity would get the better of you, yes?${prompt}
  14209: Strictly speaking, this object does not grant entry into Abyssea itself.${prompt}
  14210: It does, however, make it possible to interact with beings from that plane of existence--“Abysseans,” I call them.${prompt}
  14211: |-
    The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} serves to detect Abysseans that wander the gulf between worlds.
    How those hapless creatures--I refer to them as “Voidwalkers”--found their way there, mind you, is another subject entirely.${prompt}
  14212: 'Having drifted to this realm from the world yonder, much like the Voidwalkers themselves, ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are attuned to the presence of these creatures and will react--vibrate and emit light--when they draw near.${prompt}'
  14213: The closer your distance to a Voidwalker, the stronger the reaction becomes, until the creature is forcibly wrested into this dimension.${prompt}
  14214: 'Repeated contact with Abysseans will cause the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to take on different hues, allowing it to respond to creatures belonging to the higher echelons of Voidwalkers.${prompt}'
  14215: |-
    Be forewarned! Abysseans are among the most foul-tempered, unpredictable creatures.
    You would do well to steel yourself for a trying encounter prior to making contact.${prompt}
  14216: I trust your many adventures have made you familiar with those ghastly statues scattered across the land called cavernous maws.${prompt}
  14217: My observations have revealed that the concentration of Voidwalkers is greatest in locations where these statues are found.${prompt}
  14218: As yet, I have no plausible explanations for this phenomenon, but you neednt concern yourself with such details.${prompt}
  14219: Yours, my friend, is a dilemma infinitely simpler in nature.${prompt}
  14220: All this far-fetched talk of Abyssea, Abysseans, and Voidwalkers...${prompt}
  14221: Im fully aware of the fantastical nature of my tale, and do not think poorly of those inclined to skepticism.${prompt}
  14222: |-
    Yet I feel no need to vouch further for the authenticity of my claims.
    Such is my confidence that the truth speaks for itself.${prompt}
  14223: |-
    Now then. A great new world has presented itself before you.
    The question is, will you embrace this opportunity, or let it pass you by?${prompt}
  14224: |-
    As Abysseans cross from one realm to another, so too does gil pass from one individual to the next.
    In my mind, it is only fitting that gil is that which grants you the key to Abyssea.${prompt}
  14225: |-
    My tales have piqued your interest, have they?
    As I have mentioned prior, the price is ${number: 0} gil.${prompt}
  14226: |-
    Hand over ${number: 0} gil?
    ${selection-lines}
    Aye.
    Nay.${prompt}
  14227: |-
    No? The sum I ask is by no means prohibitive.
    Ill be waiting here, should you ever change your mind.${prompt}
  14228: |-
    I thank you for your custom.
    Here is your very own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}
  14229: 'As a service for all customers, upon request I will take your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} off your hands and dispose of it in your stead.${prompt}'
  14230: |-
    The ability to meddle with inter-dimensional matter can be considered a great power, with which comes great responsibility.
    Indeed there have been those who found the burden beyond their capacity to cope.${prompt}
  14231: It seems you are short on gil. Yet I cannot grant concessions, lest access to otherworldly realms lose its true value.${prompt}
  14232: 'I see you''ve developed a taste for ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}. Yet I fear I cannot furnish you further, for one alone is sufficient to prompt misfortune upon the heedless.${prompt}'
  14233: |-
    You wish to know how to use the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?
    There is no trick to it. Allow me to demonstrate.${prompt}
  14234: |-
    While in possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, simply assume a resting pose.
    Im given to understand it is second nature to all adventurers.${prompt}
  14235: 'Doing so will cause your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to react. Pertinent information can be gleaned by observing the magnitude of its vibration and the manner of light emitted.${prompt}'
  14236: Should neither reaction occur, take it to mean that no Voidwalkers roam the area.${prompt}
  14237: Should it vibrate softly but emit no light, take it to mean that Voidwalkers have recently passed through and may soon return.${prompt}
  14238: Should it vibrate softly and emit a gentle light, take it to mean that Voidwalkers presently roam the area.${prompt}
  14239: |-
    Now, pay particular attention to what Im about to explain.
    The reaction of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will change once a predetermined distance from a Voidwalker has been closed.${prompt}
  14240: |-
    From that point onwards, the magnitude of the vibration corresponds directly to the creatures strength.
    Based on this knowledge, it is your decision whether to pursue it further.${prompt}
  14241: The gentle glow of light, on the other hand, will intensify to become a radiant beam pointing in the direction of the creature.${prompt}
  14242: Following that beam to its end will cause the heretofore invisible Voidwalker to cross fully over into this world and take form.${prompt}
  14243: This precise moment of encounter with an Abyssean, I have dubbed “contact.”${prompt}
  14244: Not only are Abysseans known to be temperamental and unpredictable; there are those that demonstrate a degree of cunning and guile far beyond that seen in this world.${prompt}

  14247: Know also that not one, but numerous Voidwalkers may roam the land at any given time, and the readings indicate only the creature nearest you.${prompt}
  14248: You would do well to check the readings regularly, as a sudden change in the lights direction could mean a different Voidwalker has wandered your way.${prompt}
  14249: Voidwalkers will only reveal their true form at the point of contact, and seeking one only to be met with another is a scenario all adventurers want to avoid.${prompt}
  14250: |-
    But surely, you grow weary of my ramblings.
    I for one believe this is something best learned through doing.${prompt}

    Was it my aura of superior sagacity that led you here? This conspicuous crate and chest that sit seductively at my side?${prompt}
  14259: |-
    Many secrets have I to tell, but sadly, they would be beyond your meager mental faculties to fathom.
    Return when your abilities are up to the task.${prompt}
  14260: |-
    It is no matter.
    What matters is that you are here, and from the look of it, you are a suitable subject for the task I would entrust to you.${prompt}
  14261: I speak to you on behalf of the Magian Mooglehood, an ancient and august assembly of wisemoogles hailing from the once-glorious Kingdom of Kupalika.${prompt}
  14262: |-
    Our predecessors were councilors and confidants to none other than the celebrated King Kupofried himself.
    To this day, it is our mission to safeguard the secrets of their moogle magic and see them properly passed down to posterity.${prompt}
  14263: |-
    Each illustrious member of the Magian Mooglehood guards knowledge of a distinct branch of our lineal lore.
    My specialty lies in weaponry; with my aid, you will be doling out damage and destruction in ways heretofore unimagined!${prompt}
  14264: “What impelled you to impart this long-withheld wisdom to us? And why now, kupo?” the unenlightened adventurer might ask.${prompt}
  14265: 'To which the wise moogle would readily reply: The answer, my friend, is in the mog tablets--those remarkable relics wrought by King Kupofried himself--that were only recently recovered by resourceful adventurers such as rrr...yourself.${prompt}'
  14266: |-
    There is an ancient (and somewhat alarming) prophecy in our mooglehood.
    It goes...<ahem>...“King Kupofrieds creations shall slumber soundly until such time as their Super Kupowers are called upon to save the realm from utter ruin, kupo.”${prompt}
  14267: The particulars of the prophecy--preposterous as this may seem--outstrip even our prodigious powers of perception.${prompt}
  14268: 'Yet this I know, kupo: if moogle magic is what shall deliver this world from destruction, then moogle magic this world shall have--in abundance!${prompt}'
  14269: |-
    As an adventurer of renown, repute, and paramount prowess, you would seem a worthy beneficiary for our boon.
    And yet the Magian Mooglehood is nothing if not meticulously methodical. No, we must be certain...${prompt}
  14270: |-
    I propose to task you with a series of trials.
    Each time you emerge victorious, we shall proffer you a portion of our powers, kupo.${prompt}
  14271: |-
    What say you, adventurer?
    Will you undertake the Trial of the Magians, that you might one day wield the mightiest of moogle magic to save your realm from destruction and devastation?${prompt}

    Excellent.

    Lose this weapon and all your hard-won successes will be for naught.
    You must avoid such a grievous gaffe at all costs, kupo.${prompt}

  14307: |-
    Kupo-ho! Is that ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} I see?

    Kupo...oh?
    It would seem I have no trials pertaining to that particular piece of weaponry.
  14320: |-

    I have not the moogle magic at my disposal to augment items of this variety, kupo...

    Use it well, kupo.${prompt}

    Why, its the perfect union of form and function!

  14557: |-
    Crisis? No crisis here! Nuh-uh!
    Im as calm and collected as ever! Right, ${name-player}? Right?${prompt}
  14558: |-
    Whoa there! Just hold your chocobos, Mister Moogle!
    Ive got a reputation to uphold here.${prompt}
  14559: What? Why, I never...!${prompt}
  14560: |-
    Hey, be a little more gentle with a lady, will ya?
    Still, its sweet of Luto to be looking after me.${prompt}
  14561: |-
    I suppose there was no hiding it.
    Though Luto could be a bit more gentle with her choice of words...${prompt}
  14562: |-
    Aw, gee...was it that obvious?
    Tee hee hee!${prompt}
  14563: |-
    ...
    That I struggle is true, but I think Luto overstates matters.${prompt}
  14564: |-
    Hm. I am not surprised.
    I always figured that Luto for a sharp one.${prompt}
  14565: |-
    <Ahem>... Yes, yes.
    At any rate, the plight you suffer is not atypical of adventurers like yourself, kupo.${prompt}
  14566: |-
    Fortunately, I have crafted a challenge that should serve you well in your struggle to transcend your physical limits.
    ${name-player} here has already reaped the fruits of my ingenuity. Is that not right, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  14567: Yes, this sensible and not-in-the-least-sadistic trial will see you to your goal with only the minimum required quota of charred skin and broken bones. This I vouch on the honor of the Magian Mooglehood, kupo.${prompt}
  14568: Now listen closely, as I do not have all day.${prompt}
  14569: "Long and hard did I ponder on a suitable task for partners such as the two of you. \nAnd I have found the answer...${prompt}"
  14570: |-
    A trial in tandem! Two hearts beating as one!
    You will cut through reams of foes in sublime synchronicity, with not a single step, not a single breath out of rhythm...or else!${prompt}
  14571: '...Ahem, kupo.${prompt}'
  14572: Pardon me. It would seem I got carried away with myself for a moment there.${prompt}
  14573: |-
    You need not synchronize your actions to such an extreme.
    Simply partnering up to perform a simple trial shall suffice.${prompt}
  14574: A trial in tandem, the moogle says...${prompt}
  14575: |-
    A trial in tandem!
    This sounds like a challenge that were ready to meet, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  14576: |-
    A trial in tandem, eh?
    I daresay this might prove entertaining.${prompt}
  14577: |-
    A trial in tandem...?
    I suspect this will not prove as “simple” as our moogle friend suggests.${prompt}
  14578: |-

    I dont know, but the way this moogle talks gives me the heebie-jeebies.${prompt}

    A trial in tandem?
    I should hope its as simple as the moogle says. I dont want to get any scratches on my perfectly polished armor.${prompt}

    A trial in tandem?
    Has a nice ring to it, I must say.${prompt}
  14581: |-

  14582: |-
    A trial in tandem, hm?
    It sounds like a daunting task, but I shall give it my all.${prompt}
  14583: |-
    Tandem? This moogle sure uses a lot of fancy words!
    But hey, Ill be just fine as long as Im with you, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  14584: |-
    A trial in tandem?
    I care not for the whimsical name, but I look forward to facing it with you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  14585: |-
    A trial in tandem, hm?
    I can only hope the challenge lives up to its name.${prompt}
  14586: |-
    At any rate, hand this over to Brother Blue to commence your challenge.
    Now take your leave of me, kupo.${prompt}
  14587: |-

    Best of luck in your efforts!${prompt}
  14660: |-
    Why, is that not ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} already in your posssesion?
    You need only insert that into a martello to initiate replenishment.${prompt}
  14661: |-
    I see that you currently possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.
    Do you wish to abandon your upgrading efforts and participate in replenishment instead?${prompt}
  14662: 'You return the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and obtain ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} in its stead!${prompt}'
  14663: |-
    Your support is most heartening in these dark times.
    Upgrading a martello will require you to attach a device known as ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  14664: |-
    Mind you, the device is rather unwieldy.
    You will not be able to carry it and ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} at the same time.${prompt}
  14665: |-
    Excellent. I would be especially appreciative if you could upgrade those martellos in distant locations--the quicker the better.
    Be careful out there!${prompt}
  14666: |-
    Hm? Is that not ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} you hold in your hand?
    You need only find the martello you wish to upgrade, and attach it.${prompt}
  14667: |-
    Is that ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} I see?
    Do you wish to curtail your replenishment activities and assist with upgrading instead?${prompt}
  14668: |-
    Welcome back, friend! Allow me to take that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} off your hands.
    How did you fare in your efforts?${prompt}
  14669: |-
    I see, I see... Martello #0${number: 1}, you say?
    It sounds as if the operation was ${choice: 0}[a modest success./a reasonable success./a rousing success!/an unqualified success!]${prompt}
  14670: |-
    The resistance greatly values your contributions.
    Take this as a small token of our appreciation, and do not hesitate to return the next time you are willing to lend your support.${prompt}
  14671: |-
    Ive been working with these here martellos since I was knee-high.
    Ask away, and my knowledge is yours.${prompt}
  14672: |-
    Ask something?
    ${selection-lines}
    So, whats a martello?
    Martello replenishment.
    Martello upgrades.
    Cautionary notes.
    Not now.${prompt}
  14673: |-
    The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war.
    Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.${prompt}
  14674: You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.${prompt}
  14675: In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.${prompt}
  14676: |-
    This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers.
    Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.${prompt}
  14677: That being the case, were in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.${prompt}
  14678: |-
    I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel.
    Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word.
    Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.${prompt}
  14679: |-
    Feast your eyes on this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. Shes a beauty, isnt she?
    Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.${prompt}
  14680: |-
    An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations.
    Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.${prompt}
  14681: |-
    Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex.
    As such, we can only entrust it to experienced hands.${prompt}
  14682: |-
    ${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are quite large and unwieldy.
    Even the burliest among us would be unable to carry one and ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} at the same time.${prompt}
  14683: Furthermore, these materials are quite unstable, and will rapidly corrode and be rendered useless if brought outside our immediate environs.${prompt}
  14684: '''Course, not that anyone could manage to travel that far, what with these fearsome landslides...${prompt}'

    Changing areas, logging out, or becoming disconnected will cause all data pertinent to this quest to be reset.
  14686: 'Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has been lost.'
  14687: |-
    The resistance is currently suffering a materials shortage.
    Those wishing to participating in replenishment and upgrading operations should return at a later time.${prompt}

Ive received word of your accomplishments. Truly, your service to the Voidwatch has exceeded even my initial expectations.${prompt} 15037: |- And yet it is hardly the time to rejoice. You have seen it with your own eyes--no sooner is one fiend slain than another of its brethren emerges to take its place.${prompt} 15038: |- We must find a way to seal the planar rifts. Then, and only then, will we be able to quash this extradimensional menace once and for all.${prompt} 15039: |- Even as we speak, an elite team of my best researchers works tirelessly to that very end. Sadly, the true nature of the rifts remains very much an enigma...${prompt} 15040: |- And so I have no choice but to employ capable adventurers such as yourself to keep the fiends at bay. As inefficient as it may seem, it is the best course of action available to us under these conditions.${prompt} 15041: |- We are counting on your continued efforts, ${name-player}. In the meantime, take this for your service. May it serve you well.${prompt} 15042: |- Admirable work in Qufim, soldier. I did not think you had it in you. His Excellency has expressed great satisfaction in your accomplishments as well.${prompt} 15043: |- And yet we cannot afford to become complacent. For each fiend we dispatch, a more abominable monstrosity rises to take its place.${prompt} 15044: |- We have recovered much useful data from your encounters with the Voidwalkers. Data that an elite team of our best researchers works tirelessly to analyze.${prompt} 15045: |- Yes, we must discover a means to seal the rifts once and for all. Then, and only then, will victory truly be ours.${prompt} 15046: Until that day, we have no choice but to continue the fight.${prompt} 15047: You have proven yourself a valuable ally to our cause.${prompt} 15048: |- The Archduke himself trusts you greatly. That is one trust that you would do well not to betray.${prompt} 15049: |- Take this for your efforts, and do not let up the fight. We will be watching you with great interest, ${name-player}.${prompt} 15050: Pssst! ${name-player}!${prompt} 15051: |- Over here! This way, I say! Its me! Cait Sith, your feline friend!${prompt} 15052: Do forgive me for my appearance. Pardon my unfamiliar manifestation.${prompt} 15053: You may think of it as sort of passing fancy. A caits caprice.${prompt} 15054: |- But there are more important matters a-paw. Matters that would best be discussed somewhere other than here, I fear.${prompt} 15055: |- Let us rendezvous in the Pashhow Marshlands of the past. The age-old swamp. Its quite a trek, so take care and dont be late! Ta-ta, ${name-player}!${prompt} 15056: |- There ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] is, kupo! Wherever have you been, ${name-player}?${prompt} 15057: |- Heh... ${name-player} goes where adventure calls. But you can always trust ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to show up when the time is right.${prompt} 15058: |- Kupo-ho! ...So thats how it works.${prompt} 15059: |- Well, look whos finally here. I was wondering how long you were going to keep me waitaruing.${prompt} 15060: Hm? Whys that?${prompt} 15061: |- Surely you havent forgotten-wotten our contract, ${name-player}. I intend to keep my end of the bargain, so youd bettaru live up to yours.${prompt} 15062: Your mission, whether or not you choose to acceptaru it: amass ${number: 0} merit point${choice-plurality: 0}[/s] and return here to me.${prompt}'
  14763: |-
    Why, you say?
    Oh, just a little experiment of sorts.${prompt}
  14764: Ive devised a method by which the power of merit points may be channel-wanneled to rip and wrench open the reserves of chakra that lie dormant within you.${prompt}
  14765: |-
    Getting excitarued yet? Cause I sure am.
    So what are you waiting for? ${number: 0} merit point${choice-plurality: 0}[/s], and make it snappy-wappy.${prompt}
  14766: |-
    Rip and wrench?
    That sounds awfully...violent, kupo.${prompt}
  14767: |-
    Indeed...
    And yet, its a most accurate description. Heh heh...${prompt}
  14768: Kupopo?${prompt}
  14769: |-
    Hear me out, ${name-player}.
    Be strong of body and mind, and there is no limit to the powers you can master.${prompt}
  14770: You didnt sign that contract for the all-you-can-eat rarab tails, now, did you?${prompt}
  14771: |-
    Believe in yourself, and go forward, ${name-player}.
    Your destiny awaits.${prompt}
  14772: |-
    Back so soon?
    Thats our ${name-player}!${prompt}
  14773: Heh. Never met a challenge ye didnt like, eh?${prompt}
  14774: |-
    Wow, you completed that task in a jiffy-wiffy.
    Looks like I made the right choice signing a contract with you.${prompt}
  14775: |-
    Well then, lets get this show on the road.
    Dont worry, ${name-player}--itll be over in two shakes of a rarabs tail.${prompt}
  14776: |-
    Kupopo?
    Is it prudent to proceed with the process so promptly?${prompt}
  14777: |-
    Under normal circumstances, wed take things a bit more slowly-wowly.
    But hey, ${name-player} and I are people in demand. Arent we, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  14778: When I say go, were going to condense all the merit power youve accumulated into one pulsating mass of energy, then proceed to rippy-wip that straight out from the core of your soul.${prompt}
  14779: |-
    Stay focused, and try not to blink.
    It might kill you.${prompt}
  14780: K-kupo!?${prompt}
  14781: '...${prompt}'
  14782: And that should do it!${prompt}
  14783: Did we kill ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]?${prompt}
  14784: Kupo...oh!?${prompt}
  14785: Ive noted this numerous times before, but you really have a remarkably resilient body, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  14786: Its all the trainin ${choice-player-gender}[hes/shes] put in with yours truly.${prompt}
  14787: |-
    Stand tall and proud...er, if you can still stand.
    The legendary power of the bushin is yours.${prompt}
  14788: Kupo!? Thats how you pass along the power of the bushin!?${prompt}
  14789: It looked like you were just trying to blast poor ${name-player} into smithereens!${prompt}
  14790: More or less. Its the shock of the blastaru combined with the amassed power of ${name-player}'s merit points that triggers the reaction.${prompt}
  14791: By focusing all of those energies into one pulsating mass and ripping it out from within, weve opened up a veritable font of chakra inside ${name-player}'s body.${prompt}
  14792: A font...of chakra, kupo?${prompt}
  14793: They say such stores of power exist inside us all, yet most will train a lifetime without ever learnin how to tap into em...${prompt}
  14794: |-
    You laid the foundation with your physical enhancements experiments, my fluttery, furry friend.
    I simply-wimply applied the finishing touches.${prompt}
  14795: |-
    But lets get to the heart of the mattaru, ${name-player}.
    What Ive bestowed upon you today is but a foundation for powers that may yet be mastered.${prompt}
  14796: |-
    Listen, and listen well.
    Look within and take stock of your merits, and youll see a new path open to you.${prompt}
  14797: |-
    Using the energies within you, Ive burned into your soul the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    How you proceed from here is entirely up to you.${prompt}
  14798: |-
    For this is not the end of your training, but only the beginning.
    Or were you just bluffing-wuffing when you said you wanted to take me on? Haha!${prompt}
  14799: |-
    And with that, Id best be off.
    I am a man in demand, after all.${prompt}
  14800: Before that, though, I really could use a good meal and a...<yawn>...nap.${prompt}
  14801: A man in demand? More like a lazy louse, kupo.${prompt}
  14802: |-
    As enigmatic as our friend is, the realm may never know.
    Heh heh...${prompt}
  14803: |-
    Let up not in your training, ${name-player}. The path to true martial mastery lies before you.
    Now, if youll excuse me, Ive got some rarab tails t'--er, I mean, my trainin to get back to.${prompt}
  14804: You learned the secret technique of the bushin!${prompt}
  14805: |-
    Youve come. Splendid.
    We regret having to summon you again so soon after your last tour of duty, but the Duchy has need of your services again.${prompt}
  14806: Our research team has confirmed the presence of new rifts in the greater three nations area.${prompt}
  14807: |-
    Under normal circumstances, the defense effort would fall under the jurisdiction of the local governments.
    This time, however, I fear the circumstances are far from normal.${prompt}
  14808: |-
    I will be frank with you, ${name-player}.
    The strength of the enemy is beyond anything weve faced thus far.${prompt}
  14809: |-
    Here is your badge of authorization.
    Take it and report to the Voidwatch officers stationed afield for further orders.${prompt}
  14810: |-
    Once again, we have recruited other promising adventurers to our cause.
    You may find it in your best interests to join up with them before taking on the enemy.
    Were counting on you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  14811: |-
    I trust youve recovered from your last tour of duty.
    If not, so be it. Full strength or no, the Duchy requires your service.${prompt}
  14812: Ducal researchers have alerted us to the presence of newly formed planar rifts in the vicinity of the three kingdoms.${prompt}
  14813: |-
    Under normal circumstances we would let the nations fend for themselves.
    We fear that this time, however, their limited resources and manpower will do little to stem the tide of this formidable enemy.${prompt}
  14814: |-
    Hence, we turn to you.
    Take this badge of authorization and present it to our officers afield for further orders.${prompt}
  14815: |-
    We have recruited others for the effort as well.
    Join forces with them if you wish, or fight alone.
    Just remember: the success of the operation is more important than the life of any single soldier, including yours.${prompt}
  14816: As we trust you are already aware...${prompt}
  14817: |-
    Direct supervision of the Voidwatch operation will be conducted by our officers dispatched to the three nations.
    You are to follow their instructions to the letter.${prompt}
  14818: ${name-player}. Once again you prove that the Duchys faith in you was not misplaced.${prompt}
  14819: |-
    You are an asset to the Voidwatch.
    And yet the data we have recovered from your efforts yields as many questions as answers.${prompt}
  14820: |-
    The Voidwalker menace has been quieted for now.
    Yet we would be fools to believe that our foe will remain silent for long.${prompt}
  14821: Until we can identify and eliminate the source of the threat, we have no recourse but to call upon you again.${prompt}
  14822: |-
    In the meantime, take this as recompense for your efforts.
    I trust you shall put it to good use.${prompt}
  14823: What is the meaning of this interruption!?${prompt}
  14824: |-
    My pardons. Your Excellency, weve received dire news from the field.
    Two new rifts have been confirmed at previously unbreached locations...${prompt}
  14825: Hmph. Two, you say?${prompt}
  14826: Aye. One buried in the sands of the Valkurm Dunes, the other on Buburimu Peninsula.${prompt}
  14827: Your Excellency...?${prompt}
  14828: |-
    This adventurer is a veteran Voidwatcher.
    I would have ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] hear your findings as well.${prompt}
  14829: |-
    At present, it responds to neither ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} nor ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.
    We are unable to gauge the potential danger of any Voidwalkers that may lie beyond.${prompt}
  14830: |-
    Intriguing.
    So the portal between dimensions is not yet fully formed...${prompt}
  14831: |-
    It is only a matter of time before the monsters spring forth.
    Let up your watch not for a second, and send word the moment you detect anything amiss.${prompt}
  14832: Sir! Yes, sir!${prompt}
  14833: It would seem your next mission will begin sooner rather than later, soldier.${prompt}
  14834: |-
    We will authorize you for participation at such time as it is necessary.
    In the meantime, I suggest you rest up and prepare yourself for the challenges ahead.${prompt}
  14835: |-
    Too much remains unknown about these rifts.
    I grow impatient with our researchers and their incessant pleas for more time.${prompt}
  14836: |-
    I concur. The situation threatens to spiral out of control.
    We cannot afford to play the dispassionate observer for much longer.${prompt}
  14837: ${name-player} has proved a most useful...resource...in the pursuit of our goals.${prompt}
  14838: |-
    And yet there are limits to what one adventurer--or even an army of them--can do.
    It seems that we have no choice but to get involved more...directly.${prompt}
  14839: '...Yes, Your Excellency.${prompt}'
  14840: |-
    It would seem the Voidwatch effort in the three nations was a success.
    Once again, you prove yourself not entirely useless.${prompt}
  14841: |-
    The Archduke will be pleased.
    And yet the Voidwalker menace persists.${prompt}
  14842: The data we have recovered from your latest mission is...not promising.${prompt}
  14843: |-
    More details? I think you forget your station, soldier.
    You will get the information you are authorized to receive, and no more.${prompt}
  14844: |-
    Let it suffice to say that we will have need of your services again.
    Stay alive, and do not stray too far.${prompt}
  14845: |-
    I am sure you understand why we have summoned you on such short notice.
    Yes, it does indeed concern the Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  14846: Recently, however, some new facts have come to light. Reports confirm a new substance that can be culled from those planes-walking fiends.${prompt}
  14847: 'It is said to possess two separate forms: one is that of a crystal, the other of a more granular structure resembling cruor. Its alabaster hue, however, serves to distinguish it from that vermilion currency.${prompt}'
  14848: While it may exhibit crystalline properties, it is unlike any specimen of crystal we have heretofore examined. The oft-used phrase “shrouded in mystery” does not begin to describe how it baffles even our most accomplished researchers.${prompt}
  14849: We may have nothing more to guide us than conjecture, but we cannot discard the possibility that this mineral is an integral piece in the calamitous puzzle that Vanadiel faces. Do not hesitate to collect as large a sample as possible of this mysterious mineral.${prompt}
  14850: Should you require further intelligence, seek out a Voidwatch Officer. As they are the ones who operate in the field, they should be privy to the most current of information.${prompt}
  14851: Furthermore...${prompt}
  14852: Whether as hardened stone or dust deposits, this substance is less than abundant.${prompt}
  14853: Voidwatch Officers should be willing to part with some samples, however, should you fail to harvest any off of Voidwalker corpses.${prompt}
  14854: No matter the method by which you obtain it, this mineral should shine new light on this catastrophe and allow you to more efficiently aid our cause.${prompt}
  14855: To the extent of our knowledge, there is no new planar rift activity, but you of all people should understand the spontaneous nature of these interdimensional disturbances. None of us can let our guard down for even a moment.${prompt}
  14856: |-
    Archduke Kamlanaut expects great things of you as well.
    It is quite regrettable that he could not honor us with his presence today, but he is a busy man with many entice--er, engagements.${prompt}
  14857: Now that you understand how you can be of service, it is time you got to your duties. Let us conclude this parley.${prompt}
  14858: Hmm...somethings not right here.${prompt}
  14859: I would have expected their reports to have arrived by now...${prompt}
  14860: Whos this then? An adventurer, I gather?${prompt}
  14861: |-
    Well? Are you?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course!
    No...${prompt}
  14862: Please forgive my intrusion.${prompt}
  14863: I wish you well in all your endeavors.${prompt}
  14864: To find an adventurer such as yourself so quickly! Fortune indeed shines upon me this day!${prompt}
  14865: But where are my manners? I have not yet introduced myself. I am Anastase, an emissary sent from the Sacred City of Adoulin.${prompt}
  14866: But of course, you need not say anything. I know why you have sought me out.${prompt}
  14867: You are here to assist me in surveying the geomagnetic founts, yes?${prompt}
  14868: |-
    Lend your aid?
    ${selection-lines}
    I shall.
    Not interested.
    Hear more.${prompt}
  14869: I see. I must admit to feeling a twinge of disappointment, but I understand.${prompt}
  14870: My stay here will be a long one, so if you have a change of heart, please come and see me again.${prompt}
  14871: Have you changed your mind? Will you help me study the geomagnetic founts?${prompt}
  14872: I come from the Sacred City of Adoulin, an island that lies far to the west, beyond the great Sea of Zafmlug.${prompt}
  14873: Further still beyond the island is the continent of Ulbuka, where a pristine expanse of nature sits unsullied by mortal hands.${prompt}
  14874: Tales of men and women from the Middle Lands who cannot resist the clarion call of a good deed left undone have stretched across the sea and reached my ears. Hearing these tales prompted me to make the arduous journey here.${prompt}
  14875: For you see, I desire your assistance in our quest to pioneer the undeveloped lands of Ulbuka.${prompt}
  14876: I had hoped to secure transport in advance for those interested in cooperating with this enterprise.${prompt}
  14877: But executing a plan is never a simple affair. Air and sea vessels are indeed available, but unsustainable in the long term due to the staggering distance between the two continents.${prompt}
  14878: Yet one possibility exists. In our beloved city, devices called “waypoints” allow the user to instantaneously move from one location to another.${prompt}
  14879: However, I am not certain whether the ley lines to which these waypoints are attuned traverse the oceans to the Middle Lands. My first task, therefore, is to find locations suitable for such travel.${prompt}
  14880: '${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are needed to use our waypoints, but their efficacy is dependent on recording the energies of certain geomagnetic founts.${prompt}'
  14881: 'As part of this mission, I have brought with me several such ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}. What I would ask of you is that you take one to these various founts and attune it to them.${prompt}'
  14882: Unfortunately, there is precious little time to collect this information.${prompt}
  14883: As I have previously mentioned, my fervent hope is that you will undertake this mission. The very fate of my homeland hangs in the balance.${prompt}
  14884: 'What I ask is that you use ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to...oh?${prompt}'
  14885: 'You mean to tell me that you already possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}? Then this will be all the easier!${prompt}'
  14886: 'This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} for the Middle Lands.${prompt}'
  14887: 'What I would ask of you is that you attune the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to the aforementioned geomagnetic founts.${prompt}'
  14888: If this survey is successful, then it will surely guarantee a prosperous trading partnership for our two homelands.${prompt}
  14889: I also imagine that there are many who would both honor and value your accomplishment.${prompt}
  14890: 'Your help is sincerely appreciated. Let me present you with this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  14891: Attuning it to a geomagnetic fount will, if my calculations are correct, permit you to use the waypoints.${prompt}
  14892: I have already recorded the energies of the RuLude Gardens fount. Please, travel throughout the world and proceed with your activities, and return to me when you have attuned it to another fount.${prompt}
  14893: Having never been to this land, I am not familiar with the exact locations, but our powers of divination have given us a certain cryptic insight.${prompt}
  14894: |-
    Any questions?
    ${selection-lines}
    Tell me your prognostications.
    Tell me about these waypoints.
    Explain all this to me.
    None in particular.${prompt}
  14895: |-
    Which prognostication?
    ${selection-lines}
    None, actually.
    How do I record these founts?
    <Port>.${choice: 1}[ /: Complete]
    <Dwelling>.${choice: 2}[ /: Complete]
    <Spring>.${choice: 3}[ /: Complete]
    <Fort>.${choice: 4}[ /: Complete]${prompt}
  14896: |-
    Quwi Orihbhe, a member of our mission, has seen...
    A geomagnetic fount located in ${choice: 0}[a port named after a young woman/a dwelling located in plains dotted by craggy outcroppings/a gushing oasis bursting forth from the surrounding dunes/a hard-to-find locale carved out of rock].${prompt}
  14897: I realize that these tips may confound more than confirm, but the features of this land are largely unbeknownst to me.${prompt}
  14898: Yet now that I think of it, Quwi did leave further clues behind...${prompt}
  14899: |-
    Pure white beaches...
    Clay...
    Disembowelment...${prompt}
  14900: |-
    A long-necked beast...
    A chef in search of meat from that beast...
    “The Old Lady”...${prompt}
  14901: |-
    A windmill...
    A large lake...
    An island where sand stretches to the sky...${prompt}
  14902: |-
    Samurai and ninjas...
    Pirates...
    Contraband...${prompt}
  14903: Well, this certainly is quite perplexing. I only apologize that I cannot help you further.${prompt}
  14904: 'If you solve these riddles and find a geomagnetic fount, all you must do is hold up your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to the location.${prompt}'
  14905: Quite a simple task, no?${prompt}
  14906: 'I shall be waiting here to collect your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} when you have completed this endeavor.${prompt}'
  14907: Many years have I spent researching and analyzing these phenomena. Sensing any changes in the object I have given you is merely a trifle.${prompt}
  14908: To a laymans eyes, though, any deviations are impossible to detect.${prompt}
  14909: My hope is that, should these portals become fully active, even the uninitiated will be able to make such determinations with ease.${prompt}
  14910: I am sure you have noticed this mysterious device resting at my side. In Adoulin, we refer to items of its ilk as “waypoints.”${prompt}
  14911: 'These portals enable instantaneous transportation between two locations simply by holding up ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to them.${prompt}'
  14912: I am sure that now you understand the implications of my calling--if the geomagnetic founts are as strong as our research implies, then the waypoints should function here, as well.${prompt}
  14913: As we record information about the founts, we should be able to warp between more locations.${prompt}
  14914: However, there is always a price to be paid for convenience. Warping consumes a tiny bit of energy extracted from certain types of crystals.${prompt}
  14915: 'This energy, which in my field''s parlance is referred to as “kinetic units,” is imbued in ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} when extracted from these crystals.${prompt}'
  14916: Kinetic units are consumed each time you warp, meaning that periodic imbuing is necessary for continued use of the waypoints.${prompt}
  14917: Ah yes, before I forget--other members of my expedition have already gone to survey these locations.${prompt}
  14918: Should you happen to cross paths with them, make sure to emphasize that I am still waiting for their reports.${prompt}
  14919: May Altana keep you safe in this quest.${prompt}
  14920: 'Hail, and good tidings. May I please take a look at your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  14921: '...!${prompt}'
  14922: This...this is amazing!${prompt}
  14923: 'You have traveled to the ${number: 0} locations I have requested and recorded the data in the geomagnetic founts there!${prompt}'
  14924: Adventurers are truly as reliable as I was led to believe. All in a days work, I suppose.${prompt}
  14925: You have my undying gratitude for your efforts. Allow me to present this to you as a mere token of my appreciation.${prompt}
  14926: As an aside, did you happen to meet with any of the other members of my expedition?${prompt}
  14927: Though a bit wet behind the ears, their skills and talents are unparalleled.${prompt}
  14928: Among their ranks are geomancers and rune fencers--a rare sight in the Middle Lands, to be sure.${prompt}
  14929: If you were to visit Adoulin, you may be able to find out about their secrets for yourself.${prompt}
  14930: Forgive my loose tongue. Some things should be found out for oneself.${prompt}
  14931: My efforts now are focused on obtaining information about any more geomagnetic founts that may exist. I may have more information for you at a later date.${prompt}
  14932: ${name-player}, my friend! It is good to see you again. With what may I assist you today?${prompt}
  14933: |-
    Any questions?
    ${selection-lines}
    Lets expand these warp options.
    Any new predictions?

  14981: Have you gotten used to using our warp technology? Is it to your liking?${prompt}
  14982: The theoretical magical calculations behind these waypoints are based on, if my records are correct, studies done here in the Middle Lands.${prompt}
  14983: I was but a fledgling researcher at that time, so I am a tad hazy on the details of it all, but my journey from Adoulin has more meaning in light of that fact.${prompt}

  14992: Parties representing, er, former patrons of these waypoints have reported certain...anomalies. Specifically, they occasionally fall down from the heavens. Splat.${prompt}
  14993: My confidantes have been working tirelessly to determine the root cause, and our working theory is that over time, the recorded information becomes weak and unstable.${prompt}
  14994: 'I would ask that you take this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and warp to the problematic locales.${prompt}'
  14995: Once there, you can confirm the integrity of the spot and correct the recorded information as necessary.${prompt}
  14996: This all sounds more complicated than it really is. All you must do is re-attune the stone to the geomagnetic fount.${prompt}
  14997: As you have likely gathered, the instability means that I cannot guarantee that you will arrive at your intended destination.${prompt}
  14998: You could end up facing monsters tooth and claw, or be surrounded by an impenetrable mist that seeps into your very soul.${prompt}
  14999: Quite fraught with peril, indeed.${prompt}

  15016: I am quite pleased to see that you have returned whole.${prompt}
  15017: Do not be worried. Though you may not have succeeded this time, the important thing is the waypoints did not spell out your demise.${prompt}

  15138: <Sigh>${prompt}
  15139: You adventurers are all the same. It wasnt so long ago that you would face your challenges head-on with the strength of pure will, but now its all “Kupipi this” and “Ulmia that”!${prompt}
  15140: Whatll you do if they decide to go rogue, hmm? Youve got to learn how to fend for yourself, too!${prompt}
  15141: If Ive told you once, Ive told you a thousand times. Limits were made to be broken, and thats something only you can do!${prompt}
  15142: So what am I going to do with this scroll I have? Burn it and use the ashes as fertilizer!${prompt}
  15143: Maat! Maat! I come bearing tidings of trouble!${prompt}

    Its your wife! She..she...${wait-36: 1}

  15147: You left the laundry to languish, forgot to fix the floor, and instead are traipsing about town!${prompt}
  15148: That doesnt sound right. The floor is sparkling like glass in the morning sun, and I remember folding her unmentionables got me thinking of the time when...${prompt}
  15149: No no no! Those Asuran Fists of yours pounded her panties with such preposterous puissance that they perished in a plume of particles which are presently piling up around your pad!${prompt}
  15150: And that troublesome technique you try on travelers...“Bear Killer,” was it? It caused the ceiling to crumble, and now there are numerous nicks and notches furrowing into the floor!${prompt}
  15151: '...I''m a dead man.${prompt}'
  15152: Did you at least remember to get the groceries, kupo?${prompt}
  15153: I-I went! But I damned near threw my back out lugging the stuff around, so I had one of em spry fellas near the stalls haul em back for me.${prompt}
  15154: Thats not cunning...thats cheating.${prompt}
  15155: But even if I were to return and get em mself...${prompt}
  15156: Itd be too late.${prompt}
  15157: So you want to absolutely avoid heading home?${prompt}
  15158: But if I dont bring you back, shell scour my skin and skewer my sides!${prompt}
  15159: Sorry, little friend, but Im not doing it!
  15160: Kupo! Not entirely unexpected.${prompt}
  15161: Your loving wife may lamentably leave you, kupo!${prompt}
  15162: B-but I dont want to spend the end of my days rotting alone!${prompt}
  15163: |-
    ...Dare I entertain the thought?
    Maybe if I had an alter ego...${prompt}
  15164: One of the academics from the Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies told me something when I received my scroll.${prompt}
  15165: “The energies of Trust magic are a representation of the bonds of trust, friendship, and camaraderie between two individuals.”${prompt}
  15166: Perhaps...perhaps I should rethink my stance. If I can “serve” others, then so be it.${prompt}
  15167: ${name-player}! Steel yourself!${prompt}
  15168: How many times have we sparred, and how many times have you emerged the victor? If anyone has strong bonds with me, it would be you!${prompt}
  15169: Do you remember the trials the Magian Moogles gave? The ones you passed with flying colors?${prompt}
  15170: Power comes from the gut, my ${choice-player-gender}[boy/girl]. And using a gut like yours, my alter ego would be able to withstand any sucker punch my wife throws its way!${prompt}
  15171: A stomach smacker? My tummy trembles at the thought, kupo...${prompt}
  15172: You were also made to suffer the ill effects of “brown magic” as a bit of an...experiment.${prompt}
  15173: When you say it that way, it sounds so sordid.${prompt}
  15174: But now youve got a liver of steel! My alter ego should be able to withstand any shots to the organs my honey might dish out!${prompt}
  15175: There was also that time when I engaged in a fierce struggle with my eternal nemesis, Degenhard. Boy, you sure got caught up in our squabbles--but somehow remained unscathed.${prompt}
  15176: I thought my aura would be too much for you to handle, but you pulled through by the skin of your teeth.${prompt}
  15177: |-
    ...${wait-36: 1}
    Thats not how it happened, kupo.${prompt}
  15178: My old ladys got a bit of a fire aura herself, so any alter ego I make with you can surely withstand the heat!${prompt}
  15179: I also remember those “special eastern techniques” they put you through when you were frustrated with your limits once more.${prompt}
  15180: I can still see the look on that old biddy Chamamas face when that...thing came out of you. Half disgust, half curiosity.${prompt}
  15181: '...I''d be careful about calling a budding beauty like her a “biddy.”${prompt}'
  15182: Surely the alter ego we create will woo my wife into a lovelorn stupor!${prompt}
  15183: (Shed slap him silly if she saw his bluster and bravado, kupo...)${prompt}
  15184: Thisll flare up some painful memories, but... Remember that infernal contract you signed?${prompt}
  15185: The one with Atori-Tutori?${prompt}
  15186: Far be it from me to use the term “lust for power,” but...well, youre a braver ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] than I!${prompt}
  15187: Beyond doubt, the alter ego we call into being will fear nothing--nor will it sweat the small stuff!${prompt}
  15188: Such arrogant apologies would make her apoplectic, kupo...${prompt}
  15189: And finally, do you remember when I gave you a little present?${prompt}
  15190: When the time comes, and I pass on...${prompt}
  15191: I want you to take my hat, stand here in my place, and spread your wings.${prompt}
  15192: But I dont cling to illusions. I know you want to go out there, adventure, and meet lots of ${choice-player-gender}[pretty young women/strapping young lads].${prompt}
  15193: Maybe...maybe I could join too, kupo?${prompt}
  15194: Floating here is as boring as balancing boxes.${prompt}
  15195: |-
    Mayhaps my alter egod be a help then...
    His back would give out easily, though, so dont make it too tough on him! Heh heh.${prompt}
  15196: |-
    <Sigh>...
    Such a base boor you can be...${prompt}
  15197: Id hurry up, kupo. Maats tremendously tired.${prompt}
  15198: In any event. The bonds we share will surely cultivate something special!${prompt}
  15199: |-
    If you say no, then...${wait-36: 1}
    ...then Ive got to face the music.${prompt}
  15200: And Maat was never deft at dancing, kupo.${prompt}
  15201: Urk... Please! Im begging you! Dont give up on me now!${prompt}
  15202: Success, kupo!
  15203: We did it!
  15204: All who face me are like guppies before a shark! Heh heh heh!${prompt}
  15205: Positively peachy! Now you can turn the tides against your storming spouse!${prompt}
  15206: M-my...spouse...?${prompt}
  15207: Go forth, my alter ego! Im getting tired of sleeping in the doghouse!${prompt}
  15208: B-but what if she takes her wrath out on me!? Forget it, Im not going!
  15209: I knew it straight from the start, kupo!${prompt}
  15210: Have heart, Maat! There are always ample supplies of adventurers!${prompt}
  15211: |-
    <Sigh>
    I suppose youre right...after all, Ive worked hard these long years.${prompt}
  15212: Good luck with all your alter egos, ${name-player}, and remember to never give up, no matter the cost!${prompt}
  15213: Phew. When I agreed to get involved with the Trust initiative, I didnt imagine it to be so...trying.${prompt}
  15214: |-
    Hmmmmmm...
    I was sure poring over these annals of history would be enough.${prompt}
  15215: Oh ho? Do my eyes deceive me, or are you a Trust initiate?${prompt}
  15216: |-
    Are you an initiate?
    ${selection-lines}
    No...
    Uh, what are you doing?${prompt}
  15217: No? Then perhaps I need to take a break. I thought I read your magical aura properly, but my endless hours of study must have taken their toll.${prompt}
  15218: Well, there was the one gentlewoman who claims to have called forth an alter ego all by herself.${prompt}
  15219: Could you imagine what this means for our research? We may be on the verge of an incredible breakthrough!${prompt}
  15220: Rumors say that intimate knowledge of the person she was trying to summon was sufficient to complete the ritual. So here I am, researching, trying to replicate her success with a historical figure.${prompt}
  15221: 'But it''s no good. Without the bonds, we just can''t do it! The closest we''ve come is to craft ciphers--magical parchments that concentrate energies from a third party into physical forms. But that''s the rub: it still requires those bonds in the first place.${prompt}'
  15222: But someday...someday...${prompt}
  15223: Where are my manners? You didnt come here to hear a stuffy scholars ramblings.${prompt}
  15224: |-
    And just look at you!${wait-36: 2}
    Fascinating...${prompt}
  15225: |-
    Yes, your aura...${wait-36: 1}
    Ive done it again, havent I? A thousand pardons. I asked if you were part of the Trust initiative, but you are so much more than that.${prompt}
  15226: 'Take this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} as a gift from the institute. It''s a cipher crafted from the very process I spoke of earlier.${prompt}'
  15227: The emotions of separate individuals converted into magical energy. Extraordinary, wouldnt you agree? Calling forth an alter ego with the thoughts of a third party.${prompt}
  15228: Its all very experimental, so I make no promises as to the efficacy of such a scroll. Its all we can do to keep the energies from collapsing in on themselves.${prompt}
  15229: Unlike a traditional scroll, these ciphers cannot be recited by anyone with a passing level of literacy. They require the assistance of certain institute staff located in Majorité cities throughout Vanadiel.${prompt}
  15230: Still, I promise the journey will be worth it...for you, and for us.${prompt}
  15231: Bonds cannot be severed like a hot knife cutting through Selbina butter. The key is whether or not the strengths of the bonds creators are enough to survive transcription.${prompt}
  15232: If theres someone who you feel a strong connection with, what can it hurt to ask them for their cooperation? Youll never know until you try!${prompt}
  15233: Hello. Can I help you?${prompt}
  15234: 'Hm? You''re here about ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  15235: Im sorry you came all this way, but Ive already been briefed on that particular topic.${prompt}
  15236: Wait just a moment. Ah, now I remember you. Yes, Ive been looking for you ever since our last encounter. Now, I need you in the field to help with my research...${prompt}
  15237: Ah, forgive me. I was so excited to find the person I was looking for, I forgot to explain what it is Im doing.${prompt}
  15238: Ive heard from a colleague that my research into Trust magic has earned the recognition of an academic organization.${prompt}
  15239: They have even given me clearance to read their most confidential documents in pursuit of my research. Well, a portion of them at least.${prompt}
  15240: However, when comparing that information against what I had gathered, I came across some interesting discoveries.${prompt}
  15241: For example, I learned that you had defeated an unusual life-form considered to be the physical embodiment of the darkest parts of a persons soul.${prompt}
  15242: Then it struck me--a new line of thought in my Trust magic research.${prompt}
  15243: Thats right. Im researching the topic of a dark Trust magic!${prompt}
  15244: |-
    How will you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    Dark Trust magic?
    I see where this is going.${prompt}
  15245: Huh? You mean you dont know?${prompt}
  15246: Oh you do, do you?${prompt}
  15247: Well, allow me to briefly explain things just in case.${prompt}
  15248: Currently, the Trust magic you use is based on light. It draws on positive forces such as trust, friendship, and ${choice-player-gender}[brotherly/sisterly] love.${prompt}
  15249: On the other hand, Trust magic based on darkness draws upon negative forces to generate its magic, much like how that woman was able to accomplish what she did.${prompt}
  15250: Oh, I suppose Im leaving out some rather important information. That is to say, an explanation of the negative aspects of mankinds darker side.${prompt}
  15251: Im basically referring to things like apathy, arrogance, cowardice, envy, and rage. You know, the darkest parts of ones soul. I believe that everybody harbors these feelings, at least to a certain extent.${prompt}
  15252: In a sense, all of us are united by the darkness within our souls. Therefore, it only seems logical to infer that we have the necessary conditions to employ Trust magic from it.${prompt}
  15253: All that remains is to try and elevate the darkness within the alter egos soul and somehow link up with it...a type of bond all its own.${prompt}
  15254: 'Although, even if we are unable to utilize the Trust magic, we have the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} at our disposal. Intimate knowledge of your quarry should enable you to form a bond with them.${prompt}'
  15255: Which brings me to my request. Id like for you to test your mettle against those unique forces. However, it cannot be any regular fight. You must really get to know your opponent.${prompt}
  15256: I requested the A.M.A.N. to create a Records of Eminence objective for this purpose, so it should help you remain cognizant of your opponent during battle.${prompt}
  15257: Hm? You want to know how to fight this particular opponent again? I think you probably know more about that sort of thing than I do.${prompt}
  15258: You learn more about Trust magic, and I get further along in my research. Thats what I call a “win-win.”${prompt}
  15259: I heard from my colleague that he obtained a rather unusual cipher. Perhaps you should see this through to its conclusion?${prompt}
  15260: Ah, its you again. It seems everything went rather well.${prompt}
  15261: Judging by the magical aura youre giving off, Id say we got the results I was hoping for.${prompt}
  15262: Keep in mind that Trust magic research is an ongoing process. I must continue my efforts to unlock its mysteries.${prompt}
  15263: Im working on preparations for my next study. Please come by again later.${prompt}
  15264: Hello again. Ive finished making the necessary preparations. This is the data Im searching for this time.${prompt}
  15265: Thanks again for your help.${prompt}

  15383: Like everything he does, it is destined to end in abject failure.${prompt}
  15384: Hm? What do you mean it is none of my business?${prompt}
  15385: Do you know who you are speaking to? I am Marjory, the most brilliant magician this realm has ever seen, and the foremost expert on Trust research!${prompt}

  15389: I am pleased to see you make such a wise decision! Hehe... I cannot wait to see that buffoon Jamal choke on his own words!${prompt}
  15390: Now then! Jamal likes to equate the darkness of alter egos to the root of all evil or some such nonsense, but as with most things, he could not be more wrong.${prompt}
  15391: These are just my thoughts on the issue, but...${prompt}
  15392: You see, unlike Jamal, I do not believe that Trust magic is something meant to be cast outwards from its user.${prompt}
  15393: No, Trust magic is designed to look within us. In other words...${prompt}
  15394: The alter egos take shape due to the power contained within a kind of unseen pipeline inside of us that conveys our feelings and thoughts to them.${prompt}
  15395: That got me thinking! If one could somehow boost the amount of those feelings and thoughts being sent...${prompt}
  15396: It could lead to the alter ego itself becoming even more powerful!${prompt}
  15397: Hm? What do you mean you dont understand? You really are quite dense, arent you?${prompt}
  15398: Well, I am stuck with you, I guess, so you will need a few things if you are to help me with my research.${prompt}
  15399: First of all, you will need this special diamond.${prompt}
  15400: It is capable of detecting the feelings and thoughts you direct at the alter ego you are summoning.${prompt}
  15401: This diamond then stores them within its crystalline confines.${prompt}
  15402: Once it has gathered a certain amount of thoughts and feelings, it will change color.${prompt}
  15403: So basically, I need you to use your Trust magic until you see the diamond change color!${prompt}
  15404: To help you to that end, I have also prepared something else for you.${prompt}
  15405: I ordered the A.M.A.N. to provide you with a list of Records of Eminence objectives!${prompt}
  15406: There are three objectives for you to complete. You simply need to complete them all to collect what is necessary!${prompt}
  15407: Ah, that reminds me. No matter what, you must not lose this diamond.${prompt}
  15408: It is made from an extremely rare gemstone, so I forced my mothers jewelry shop to let me have it.${prompt}
  15409: It was originally a rather unusual diamond that changed color whenever it sensed a change in the surrounding temperature.${prompt}
  15410: I simply used a little magic to make some key improvements and recreate something from a legend I once heard in a faraway land!${prompt}
  15411: Now then, let us begin the experiment!${prompt}
  15412: Ah, there you are! I was expecting you much sooner. Hurry up and hand me the diamond already.${prompt}
  15413: Hmm... Very well done. You have collected just the right amount of thoughts and feelings. Now, for just a touch of magic...${prompt}
  15414: I-its a staggering success! The thoughts have been imbued into the diamond!${prompt}
  15415: Listen carefully. You simply need to use this diamond as a catalyst when invoking your Trust magic.${prompt}
  15416: When you do, the thoughts sent to your alter ego when it manifests will be made even more powerful.${prompt}
  15417: That power will then be sent to the alter ego when you attempt to call upon it.${prompt}
  15418: As a result, the alter ego itself will also become stronger!${prompt}
  15419: However, there is one thing you need to be careful of.${prompt}
  15420: The more of these pipelines you use to call forth the alter egos, the weaker the effect of the catalyst will become.${prompt}
  15421: I can see that your feeble mind is not comprehending what I am saying. Let me see, how can I dumb this down so even you can understand it...${prompt}
  15422: If your party is made up of you and five alter egos, that means that five pipelines will be used, so each alter ego will only be slightly powered up.${prompt}
  15423: And if your party contains you and one other member, along with four alter egos, that means there would be four alter ego pipelines and each one will be a little stronger.${prompt}
  15424: Finally, if there are five in your party along with only one alter ego, that means there is also only one alter ego pipeline, so it will be made considerably stronger.${prompt}
  15425: Do you understand now? Yes? I am glad to hear it.${prompt}
  15426: Take note that the catalyst will not be effective unless you yourself are of considerable strength.${prompt}
  15427: You must be strong if you wish to extract the power from the catalyst.${prompt}
  15428: Now get out there and experience the fruits of my research for yourself!${prompt}

  15489: Strife descended upon us in but an instant. Umbral energies radiated from the crystal, and the world was wrapped in gloom before we had a chance to draw breath.${prompt}
  15490: You mean that we were obliterated into the darkness without knowing why?${prompt}
  15491: Or was there a reason why we could not tell you?${prompt}
  15492: I fear the plot will continue to thicken.${prompt}

  15501: You have yet to meet with Lady Prishe, correct?${prompt}

  15503: Prishe...? Who is this woman of whom you speak?${prompt}
  15504: Ah, so the two of you have yet to cross paths.${prompt}

  15522: '...is that I received a benevolent puissance when you and Sir Tenzen visited me on Reisenjima during the ultimate conflict.${prompt}'
  15523: Yet I must reiterate that I do not exist in this era.${prompt}
  15524: My presence has caused the wheel of fate to spin, and I fear that it may not come to rest in an advantageous position.${prompt}
  15525: Yet should you remain ever unflinching as you tackle this most arduous of journeys...${prompt}

  15713: Mandragora Mania is a game in which you battle for jingly by moving your mandragora pieces to the goal.${prompt}
  15714: 'Your goal is the ${choice: 0}[red/blue/green] one on the right, while your opponent''s is the ${choice: 0}[blue/green/red] one on the left.${prompt}'
  15715: At the start of the game, three mandragoras each will be placed on the eight game areas, excluding the goal.${prompt}
  15716: There are five starting placements (A through E), and you are able to select which one you would like to employ. The default setting is "Random."${prompt}
  15717: This explanation uses pattern A, but the basic rules are the same regardless of the starting pattern.${prompt}
  15718: 'The three ${choice: 0}[red/blue/green] areas in front of you are yours,${wait-36: 2}the three ${choice: 0}[blue/green/red] areas at the back are your opponent''s,${wait-36: 2}and the remaining two are neutral.${prompt}'
  15719: You must choose one area--either yours or a neutral one--to proceed.${prompt}
  15720: The areas are numbered from one to five starting from the left, and any mandragoras in the area you select will move.${prompt}
  15721: Conversely, your opponent must select either a neutral area or an area that belongs to them.${prompt}
  15722: From the right, those areas are numbered 6, 4, 7, 2, and 8.${prompt}
  15723: 'For example, if you select Area 1,${wait-36: 4}one mandragora will move to Area 2${wait-36: 1}and one will move to Area 3,${wait-36: 1}and one will move to Area 4.${prompt}'
  15724: Note that the mandragoras will move from the back first--last in, first out.${prompt}
  15725: You will receive points known as “jingly” each time one of your mandragoras reaches the goal.${prompt}
  15726: You will enter your opponents territory whenever you go past the goal.${prompt}
  15727: If one of your mandragoras happens to reach the opponents goal, the goal will be pushed back and your mandragora will return to your own area. You dont have to worry about your mandragora earning any jingly for your opponent.${prompt}
  15728: The order in which players choose areas will be determined based on your turn settings. The default setting is random.${prompt}
  15729: This explanation has skipped past your opponents turn for demonstration purposes, but in the actual game you and your opponent will take turns choosing areas.${prompt}
  15730: However, if the last mandragora to move reaches the goal, you will get to take an additional turn.${prompt}
  15731: Mandragoras are a very diverse species, and the amount of jingly you earn is determined by the species of mandragora that crosses into the goal.${prompt}
  15732: 'Adenium and citrullus: 3 jingly (first player)/4 jingly (second player).${prompt}'
  15733: 'Korrigan and pachypodium: 2 jingly (first player)/3 jingly (second player).${prompt}'
  15734: 'Standard mandragoras: 1 jingly (both players).${prompt}'
  15735: The game is over when either you or your opponent no longer has any mandragoras that can move.${prompt}
  15736: The player who has the most jingly at that point will be declared the winner.${prompt}
  15737: The key to victory lies in taking advantage of the various mandragora subspecies bonuses while claiming multiple turns in a row.${prompt}

    I could really use your help with something.${prompt}
  15772: You see, this rather flashy young lady came by recently with a Goblin in tow...${prompt}
  15773: She was talking about putting on a new show with some Goblins and that she needed to get stronger.${prompt}
  15774: |-
    The price was most definitely right, and she was eager enough.
    Indeed, she wouldve made a fabulous student, but that outfit of hers...${prompt}
  15775: |-
    All that fabric fluttering about was quite distracting.
    I simply suggested she go change, but she immediately replied “Whats wrong with this outfit!? What else should an idol wear!?”${prompt}
  15776: |-
    The heart of a young maiden is a strange thing indeed.
    Even after all these years, I have yet to understand its many mysteries.${prompt}
  15777: |-
    Hm? Actually, now that I think about it...
    That was when I started feeling under the weather too.${prompt}
  15778: |-
    Well, I cant say for sure that there is a connection.
    Anyway, the favor I want to ask you concerns this young lady, you see.${prompt}
  15779: |-
    I need you to find her and return this basket for me.
    She forgot it in all of the hoopla.${prompt}
  15780: |-
    You should first pay a visit to the junk dealer known as Muckvix in Lower Jeuno.
    He might know where to find her.${prompt}
  15781: |-
    The Goblin that brought her here was from there, after all.
    I appreciate your help with this matter.${prompt}
  15782: 'Please find the girl that came here to train and give her back this ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} for me.${prompt}'

  15785: |-

    Thats a relief.${prompt}

    I tell ya, its no fun getting old.${prompt}
  15788: |-

  15797: Haha! Its okay, Ill handle this!${prompt}
  15798: |-

    This isnt an actual show, you see. Were still holding auditions.${prompt}
  15799: Youre what!? Are you serious!?${prompt}
  15800: |-
    Heh heh...
    Maat here said he wanted to be a part of the Goblin festival too.${prompt}
  15801: |-
    I guess his performance in the audition was a little too...passionate.
    Were sorry for all the fuss.${prompt}
  15802: |-
    You can say that again!
    The Festival of Brave Souls was canceled because of you!${prompt}
  15803: I dont think you understand just how serious this is!${prompt}
  15804: |-
    Ungh...
    I dont remember any of that...${prompt}
  15805: |-
    Somehow, I found myself covered in various scrapes and bruises.
    Maybe thats how I lost my memories?${prompt}
  15806: Ah!
  15807: |-
    Seriously!?
    You were beaten so badly you lost your memory!?${prompt}
  15808: Hmph! What kind of person would beat up on an old man like that!?${prompt}
  15809: Um...
  15810: |-
    No, it was all my fault.
    At least those people I scared can rest easily now.${prompt}
  15811: |-
    Well, I suppose youre right.
    I hear the Goblins have resumed preparations for their festival as well.${prompt}
  15812: If youre interested in the festival, miss, you should go speak with the Goblins.${prompt}
  15813: Id hurry up before they change their minds.${prompt}
  15814: Oh, yes, of course! Ill go at once!${prompt}
  15815: |-
    Now then...
    You there. You look familiar.${prompt}
  15816: |-
    Im Shami.
    Weve conducted some business together in the past.${prompt}
  15817: |-
    My name is Shami.
    I trade in rather unusual items back in Port Jeuno with adventurers much like yourself.${prompt}
  15818: |-
    That there is Shemo.
    Were kind of like what youd call brothers.${prompt}
  15819: |-
    We both know you quite well.
    Youve made quite the reputation for yourself around here.${prompt}
  15820: |-
    Anyway, in regards to Maat...
    Everything we told that girl was made up.${prompt}
  15821: Shed probably feel bad if she knew the truth.${prompt}
  15822: 'You see, it was the ${item-singular: 1[2]} she made Maat eat that caused that to happen to him.${prompt}'
  15823: Maat probably mentioned something about her paying him handsomely to help train her, yes?${prompt}
  15824: |-
    Thats the problem, you see. Her “payment” to him was a boiled egg.
    In fact, I believe its one youre quite familiar with.${prompt}
  15825: |-
    You mean...
    ${selection-lines}
    The World Eater Egg!?
    The ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}!?

  15826: J’en ai bien peur!${prompt}
  15827: Non, devinez encore!${prompt}

  15829: Quoi qu’il en soit... ${prompt}
  15830: |-
    Heureusement, l’oeuf de mangeur de monde quil avait mangé sétait considérablement détérioré.
    Cela aurait donc pu être bien pire pour lui.${prompt}
  15831: Voyez-vous, lorsqu’il était éveillé, il parvenait à contenir le pouvoir qui irradiait en lui.${prompt}
  15832: Mais dès qu’il s’endormait, il se transformait en ce monstre que vous avez vu de vos propres yeux.${prompt}
  15833: |-
    Heh heh heh.
    Cependant, grâce à votre combat contre lui, le pouvoir de l’œuf semble avoir encore diminué, pour l’instant du moins.${prompt}
  15834: |-
    Vous pouvez vous en remettre à nous.
    Nous veillerons à ce que le reste du pouvoir de loeuf soit absorbé et scellé correctement.${prompt}
  15835: L’ombre mystérieuse qui hante cet endroit chaque nuit ne devrait plus poser de problème.${prompt}
  15836: |-
    Voilà, c’est pour vos ennuis.
    J’ai le sentiment que vous en aurez besoin avant que tout ne soit terminé. ${prompt}
  15837: |-
    J’ai reçu quelque chose de Shami et Shemo qu’ils voulaient que je te donne.
    Voilà. ${prompt}
  15838: Après avoir parlé à Shami et Shemo, j’ai l’impression quun grand poids a été enlevé de ces épaules fatiguées.${prompt}
  15839: |-
    J’ai entendu dire qu’ils possédaient des capacités assez mystérieuses, mais je suis bien content qu’ils soient là pour m’aider.
    Heh heh heh.${prompt}
