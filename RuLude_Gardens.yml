    I was not expecting you so soon. Monarlais...tell him.${prompt}
  6813: Yes, sire.
  6814: Francmage, I've summoned you here today to talk about one thing--the Northlands investigation.${prompt}
  6815: Oh, yes, that. Those Bastoker Humes are causing no end of trouble--saying they want to investigate here, there, and the other place...${prompt}
  6816: It is true! The Humes are fools, and no better. Can they truly believe that some ancient power lies hidden in that forsaken wasteland?${prompt}
  6817: Hah! Do they hope to find the gates to eternal Paradise there, in that lair of fiends most uncouth? Preposterous!${prompt}
  6818: We must take control of this situation immediately. Still, we cannot let them walk about the Northlands freely. Who knows what they're plotting under the guise of this “investigation.”${prompt}
  6819: Francmage, listen. Go with the investigation party, and keep a close eye on what our foreign “friends” do. They are up to something, it is certain.${prompt}
  6820: I am sure nothing will come of this, but in case they do find something in that wasteland, do not let them take it. Understood?${prompt}
  6821: As you command, my lord. I would give the very blood that runs in my veins if it were to further the cause of our kingdom. You can rely on me.${prompt}
  6822: These foreigners are wily and faithless. Never let down your guard, and may the Goddess of the Dawn protect you in Her mercy.${prompt}
  6823: The king has taken a beautiful queen, and I think a splendid addition to the royal family is not far off. An heir, perhaps...${prompt}
  6824: We people of San d'Oria, too, must ever look to the future. The Elvaan must never fall behind foreigners, in power or faith.${prompt}

  10113: Le consulat est absent.${prompt}
  10114: Vous n’avez pas de permis pour voir l’archiduc.${prompt}
  10115: Vous êtes donc le nouvel attaché.${prompt}
  10116: Je suis Kam’lanaut, archiduc de Jeuno. J’aimerais que votre nation m’aide dans une certaine affaire.
  10117: Oh, un visiteur ? ${prompt}
  10118: Bonjour. Je m’appelle Eald’narche. Enchanté.${prompt}
  10119: Voici mon frère. Ne le laissez pas vous déranger.${prompt}
  10120: Passons aux choses sérieuses. Je vous ai convoqué pour une certaine mission. Avez-vous entendu parler du Seigneur des Ombres ? ${prompt}
  10121: Mes sources me disent que les hommes-bêtes de Davoi, de Beadeaux et du château d’Oztroja conspirent pour le ramener à Vana’diel.${prompt}
  10122: Ils cherchent à le faire en exploitant le pouvoir de pierres mystérieuses appelées magicite.${prompt}
  10123: Pour mettre fin à leur plan infâme, je veux que vous vous rendiez à ces trois endroits et que vous vous empariez de cette magicite.${prompt}
  10124: 'Bien entendu, j’ai l’intention de vous récompenser pour une tâche de cette ampleur. J’émettrai ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} à la réception des trois magicites.${prompt}'
  10125: Avec cela, vous pourrez rapidement rentrer chez vous, ou dans n’importe quel pays civilisé, d’ailleurs.${prompt}
  10126: Ils en ont donc après la magicite, n’est-ce pas ? Je me demande ce que cela signifie... Faites très attention. L’idée d'un monde sous le contrôle des hommes-bêtes me fait frémir.${prompt}
  10127: Je parie que les hommes-bêtes ont des pièges qui les attendent. D’abord, il faut en savoir le plus possible.${prompt}
  10128: Eald’narche dit vrai. Commencez par vous renseigner en ville. Je compte sur vous!${prompt}
  10129: Un moment, s’il vous plaît. ${prompt}
  10130: Sur ordre de Sa Grâce, nous avons décidé de demander l’aide du Tenshodo, l’organisation dirigée par cet Aldo.${prompt}
  10131: Cette dépêche secrète expose nos souhaits. Auriez-vous l’amabilité de la lui remettre ? ${prompt}
  10132: C’est un homme aux multiples talents. Il serait sage de faire sa connaissance. Bonne chance!${prompt}
  10133: Excellent travail. Comment se porte l’archiduc ? ${prompt}
  10134: Il veut que vous rassembliez la magicite ? Je ne connais rien aux objets de culte, mais vous devriez peut-être essayer d’en apprendre plus sur Davoi, Beadeaux et le château d’Oztroja.${prompt}
  10135: Repos, soldat. Alors, comment était l’archiduc ? ${prompt}
  10136: Il veut que vous récoltiez de la magicite ? Ce genre de chose dépasse largement mes compétences, vous devriez donc parcourir le pays à la recherche d'indices sur Davoi, Beadeaux et le château d'Oztroja.${prompt}
  10137: Alors, vous avez vu l'archiduc... Comment ça s'est passé ? ${prompt}
  10138: Il veut que vous ramassiez de la magicite ? Je ne peux pas vous donner de conseils à ce sujet. Peut-être pourriez-vous essayer de vous renseigner sur Davoi, Beadeaux et le château d’Oztroja... ${prompt}
  10139: Magicite ! Oui, ces pierres émettent le même pouvoir que les cristaux. Bien qu'impur, ce pouvoir est immense.${prompt}
  10140: On comprend maintenant pourquoi les hommes-bêtes se sont rassemblés là où ils l'ont fait. Ils ont été attirés par le grand pouvoir de la magicite!${prompt}
  10141: Oui, il est temps d'éradiquer la menace des hommes-bêtes une fois pour toutes.${prompt}
  10142: 'Je vous remercie pour vos services. Voici ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}. Grâce à lui, vous pourrez vous rendre dans n’importe quelle nation.${prompt}'
  10143: 'Pour l’instant, je vous remercie pour votre service. Puisque vous avez déjà ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}, veuillez accepter ceci à la place. Puissiez-vous le dépenser à bon escient.${prompt}'
  10144: Les trois pierres sont incomplètes, mais avec les pouvoirs de la quatrième pierre qui repose sous le château de Zvahl...${prompt}
  10145: Peut-être que le Seigneur de l’Ombre se relèvera alors.${prompt}
  10146: Bien sûr, le talisman qui scelle les profondeurs de Zvahl a été mis en place il y a plus de vingt ans. Il empêcherait toute tentative. ${prompt}
  10147: J’ai également lu que les trois clés permettant d'ouvrir le sceau étaient gardées en sécurité par les trois grandes nations... ${prompt}
  10148: Votre Grâce!${prompt}
  10149: Qu'est-ce que c’est ?${prompt}
  10150: Mauvaises nouvelles, Votre Grâce ! Les dirigeants des trois nations ont été attaqués!${prompt}
  10151: Attaqués... Par des hommes-bêtes ? ${prompt}
  10152: Oui, Votre Grâce.${prompt}
  10153: Qu’ils soient confondus ! Ils ont une longueur d’avance sur nous.${prompt}
  10154: Ils cherchent donc à ressusciter le Seigneur des Ombres... Un objectif plutôt noble pour des hommes-bêtes.${prompt}
  10155: Ainsi soit-il. Peut-être devriez-vous retourner à votre ambassade.${prompt}
  10156: Je vous demanderai à nouveau votre aide bientôt. D’ici là, portez-vous bien.${prompt}
  10157: Qu'est-ce qui se passe ? Oh, vous n'avez pas besoin de me le dire.${prompt}
  10158: Oh, vous êtes allé au château d’Oztroja et vous y avez rencontré une certaine Verena.${prompt}
  10159: Et elle s’entend bien avec les hommes-bêtes. Wow, alors peut-être qu’on pourrait s’entendre.${prompt}
  10160: Hé, Wolfgang ! Wolfie, vous êtes là ? ${prompt}
  10161: Que me demandez-vous, Seigneur Eald’narche ?${prompt}
  10162: Pourriez-vous trouver une certaine Verena et l’amener ici ? J’ai entendu dire qu’elle était la petite soeur d’Aldo.${prompt}
  10163: Bien sûr, mon seigneur. Mais puis-je vous demander pourquoi ? Elle semble avoir des intentions... douteuses. ${prompt}
  10164: Je pense qu’elle a des pouvoirs intéressants, alors je veux juste jouer avec elle. C’est tout.${prompt}
  10165: Oh, et ne dis pas ça à Kam’lanaut. Je veux le surprendre. ${prompt}
  10166: Comme vous voulez, mon seigneur. ${prompt}
  10167: Heh. J’ai hâte !${prompt}
  10168: ${name-player} ! Vous êtes enfin de retour ! Félicitations pour votre succès !${prompt}
  10169: Je regrette que vous n’ayez pas le temps de vous reposer. Notre bien-aimé San d’Oria est en danger !${prompt}
  10170: Son Excellence est absente, veuillez porter ceci à la cour à sa place. Prenez le dirigeable ! Je resterai et ferai ce que je peux. ${prompt}
  10171: Hâtez-vous vers San d’Oria ! Vous pouvez monter à bord du dirigeable maintenant, n’est-ce pas ? Je vais rester ici et découvrir ce que je peux faire.${prompt}
  10172: Je suis soulagé qu’il n'y ait pas eu de danger. Notre ambassade est également en sécurité. Pour l’instant, obéissez aux ordres de la Cour.${prompt}
  10173: ${name-player} ! Vous êtes revenu en un seul morceau!${prompt}
  10174: Pas le temps de se reposer, soldat ! Votre pays a besoin de vous.${prompt}!
  10175: L'ambassadeur n’est pas là, vous allez devoir rapporter ceci à l’administration. Prenez le dirigeable ! Je reste ici pour faire toute la lumière sur cette affaire.
  10176: Prenez ce dirigeable pour Bastok, soldat ! Je resterai ici pour découvrir ce que je peux faire.${prompt}
  10177: Alors, c'est comme d'habitude à Bastok, hein ? Eh bien, nous n'avons rien de spécial pour vous ici, alors essayez de suivre les directives de l'administration.${prompt}
  10178: Et voilà ! Bon travail, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  10179: Je suis désolé, mais vous n’avez pas le temps de vous reposer ! Notre chère Windurst est en grand danger !${prompt}
  10180: L'ambassadeur étant parti, je veux que vous rameniez ceci à la mère patrie. Prenez le dirigeable, c'est plus rapide. Je vais voir ce que je peux faire ici. ${prompt}
  10181: Vite, vite ! Prenez le dirigeable pour retourner à Windurst ! Je trouverai ce que je peux ici.${prompt}
  10182: Tant que le Star Sibyl est en sécurité, tout va bien. Nous n'avons aucune tâche à vous confier ici, alors continuez à servir votre pays.${prompt}
  10183: 'Vous n’avez pas ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}'
  10184: Personne ne voit le souverain sans rendez-vous !${prompt}
  10185: Retirez-vous!${prompt}
  10186: 'Un instant. Je dois voir votre ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}...${prompt}'
  10187: Merci. Si le souverain demande à être reçu, l’accès à la chambre sera accordé par les gardes à l’intérieur.${prompt}
  10188: 'Je suis désolé, mais vous aurez besoin de ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} pour entrer.${prompt}'
  10189: C’est la salle de la Garde Ducale. Seuls les meilleurs guerriers peuvent y entrer. A bien y réfléchir, ce n’est pas un endroit pour des civils comme vous.${prompt}
  10190: Seigneur Wolfgang est notre chef. Il a été choisi non seulement pour son habileté aux armes, mais aussi pour sa détermination inébranlable.${prompt}
  10191: Qui êtes-vous et que faites-vous ? Oh, vous êtes un attaché... Toutes mes excuses ! Je dois contrôler tous ceux qui passent par ici.${prompt}
  10192: Dans ce travail, je suppose que tout le monde est coupable jusqu'à preuve du contraire. Je ne voulais pas vous offenser.${prompt}
  10193: Bienvenue. C’est la demeure de l’archiduc, veuillez vous comporter en conséquence. ${prompt}
  10194: Les seigneurs Kam’lanaut et Eald’narche font rarement des apparitions publiques.${prompt}
  10195: Et il faut un permis spécial pour les rencontrer.${prompt}
  10196: Ils ont tous les deux gardé leur jeunesse pendant toutes ces années. Peut-être qu’une puissance d'un autre monde veille sur eux. Les grands prophètes comme eux sont rares!${prompt}
  10197: Dites... Vous connaissez Aldo, l’homme qui dirige l’organisation appelée Tenshodo ?${prompt}
  10198: |-
    Le connaissez-vous ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui.
    Non.${prompt}
  10199: Le Tenshodo a été fondé par le père d’Aldo. Ils ont si bien réussi à commercer à l’étranger qu’ils détiennent le marché noir dans cette région. J’ai entendu dire...${prompt}
  10200: Aldo a pris le relais après la mort de son père. J’ai entendu toutes sortes de choses à son sujet, mais on dit que c’est un homme intelligent et honorable.${prompt}
  10201: Oh, vous êtes un membre de Tenshodo ? Je suppose que vous en savez plus que moi.${prompt}
  10202: Vous devriez aussi faire affaire avec le Tenshodo. Ils nous fournissent des marchandises difficiles à trouver de temps en temps.${prompt}
  10203: Derrière nous se dresse le monument de la paix, construit après la guerre. Les ambassades ont été construites autour de lui.${prompt}
  10204: Les seigneurs Kam’lanaut et Eald’narche ont conçu les jardins de Ru’Lude. Il suffit de les regarder pour comprendre à quel point ils chérissent la paix.${prompt}
  10205: Ces terres sont le domaine des Seigneurs Kam’lanaut et Eald’narche. Veuillez vous comporter correctement.${prompt}
  10206: Avez-vous déjà rencontré le Seigneur Eald’narche ? Il n’est encore qu’un gamin, mais le frère de l’archiduc est doté d’incroyables talents.${prompt}
  10207: Jeuno est en sécurité tant qu’il y a l’archiduc Kam’lanaut et le seigneur Eald’narche.${prompt}
  10208: Les trois grandes nations prônent l’amitié, mais sous la façade se cache une lutte pour la suprématie. Personne ne peut dire ce qu’il en adviendra.${prompt}
  10209: C’est pourquoi nous devons nous concentrer sur nos devoirs. Rien ne garantit que le règne de paix dont nous jouissons aujourd’hui durera.${prompt}
  10210: Saviez-vous que Seigneur Eald’narche porte un cache-œil ? Il a eu un accident quand il était petit, mais ça ne l’a pas affecté ! Qu’il soit béni.${prompt}
  10211: Dans le chaos de la guerre, l’archiduc avait un plan brillant. Il pensait que la seule chance des trois nations était de mettre de côté leurs querelles et de s’unir.${prompt}
  10212: Chaque nation devait assumer un fardeau égal dans la lutte contre les hommes-bêtes. Sa stratégie était vraiment brillante!${prompt}
  10213: Sans ses conseils, ce monde aurait sombré dans l’ombre sous la domination des hommes-bêtes.
  10214: Dans le passé, il y a eu une terrible guerre. Mon père m’a raconté que la terre, balayée par des vents furieux, était imprégnée du sang des morts.${prompt}
  10215: J’ai entendu ses récits chaque fois qu’il noyait son chagrin dans la boisson. Ses histoires sont maintenant gravées dans ma mémoire.${prompt}
  10216: Le père de Seigneur Wolfgang était aussi un soldat célèbre. Il a commandé les forces de Jeuno pendant la Guerre de Cristal, et ses exploits sont légendaires.${prompt}
  10217: Après la guerre, il s’est occupé des familles de ses camarades tombés au combat. Quel grand homme... La force brute n’est pas le seul atout d’un soldat !${prompt}
  10218: Parfois, je vois les choses les plus bizarres ici. Une fois, une de nos recrues a été maudite dans la nécropole d'Eldieme, et je n’ai pas su quoi faire.${prompt}
  10219: Je parie qu’il se prépare des choses bien trop folles pour que nous puissions les imaginer.${prompt}
  10220: Une fois, j’ai emmené un nouveau à la nécropole d'Eldieme, et il y a été maudit. Il est devenu fou et a eu une envie irrépressible de viande crue.${prompt}
  10221: J’y ai réfléchi... Et vous savez, ces torches en pierre dans les pièces ? J’ai entendu dire que les esprits les détestaient...${prompt}
  10222: |-
    Je me suis dit que ça aiderait si j'allumais une lanterne avec ces flammes et que je l'apportais ici.
    C'est comme ça qu'on a sauvé le gars.${prompt}
  10223: Mais... j’ai aussi entendu dire que certains esprits aimaient ce genre de feu. Ce n’est donc pas toujours une bonne idée.${prompt}
  10224: Je crois qu’on a eu de la chance. Nous ne savions pas quoi faire d’autre, et nous voulions juste faire ce que nous pouvions.${prompt}
  10225: Si vous voulez, nous pouvons vous prêter la lanterne que nous utilisions à l’époque. Qu’en dites-vous ?${prompt}
  10226: |-
    Voulez-vous emprunter la lanterne ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui, s'il vous plaît.
    Pas maintenant.${prompt}
  10227: Essayez de raviver les flammes dans cette lanterne. Nous ne savons pas ce qui pourrait nous aider.${prompt}
  10228: Je crois me souvenir qu’il y avait quatre torches et qu’il fallait les allumer dans le bon ordre.${prompt}
  10229: Oui, c’est vrai. Je me souviens avoir tout raté. Dommage que j’aie oublié le bon ordre. Eh bien, je suis sûr que vous pouvez trouver la solution.${prompt}
  10230: N’oubliez pas que c’est la salle de la pierre ouvragée que vous cherchez. Les torches des cavernes servent à autre chose, ne les confondez pas.${prompt}
  10231: Ah oui ? Vous pouvez l’utiliser à tout moment. ${prompt}
  10232: Si vous saviez exactement quel est l’esprit qui vous possède, vous pourriez l’exorciser. Mais c’est le dernier recours, vous savez ? ${prompt}
  10233: Oh, le truc de la flamme n’a pas marché, hein ? Je suis content que l'esprit soit parti !{prompt}
  10234: Oui, je le savais. On en apprend tous les jours. Je vais l’écrire dans le journal des gardes.{prompt}
  10235: Je me suis toujours demandé comment quelqu’un de sa taille pouvait allumer cette lanterne.{prompt}
  10236: L’archiduc reçoit tellement de dignitaires que chaque soir est un banquet. Composer des menus originaux m’inquiète !${prompt}
  10237: Voici la chambre de l’archiduc. C'est le seul endroit où il peut se réfugier pour échapper à son emploi du temps chargé... ${prompt}
  10238: Mais il est toujours dehors, à faire de son mieux pour le Duché. Nous l’admirons tous beaucoup. Ses actes ne profitent pas seulement à Jeuno, mais aussi au monde entier.${prompt}
  10239: Tout ce que je peux faire en retour, c’est changer ses draps et préparer une soupe chaude.{prompt}
  10240: Ces œuvres font partie de la collection de Seigneur Eald’narche. Sa Seigneurie est versée dans l’histoire comme dans l’art.${prompt}
  10241: L’archiduc et son frère se détendent souvent dans cette pièce. Nous attendons toujours à l’extérieur, mais ils semblent s’entendre assez bien.${prompt}
  10242: Je ne m’immisce pas dans leurs conversations, mais leur connaissance de la politique, de la culture et de la philosophie rivalise avec celle des érudits.${prompt}
  10243: Notre travail consiste à confronter toute personne suspecte. S’il arrivait quelque chose à l’archiduc, les répercussions se feraient sentir dans le monde entier.{prompt}
  10244: Ce monument a été érigé à la fin de la guerre... pour rappeler que personne ne devrait plus jamais souffrir de la sorte.{prompt}
  10245: Aujourd’hui, les gens oublient les erreurs du passé et se disputent à nouveau. Je parie que c’est le seul endroit où l'on se souvient encore de cette promesse.${prompt}
  10246: Je veux que quelqu’un prenne cette carte que j’ai trouvée dans le nord et évite un désastre imminent, mais vous n’avez pas l'air prêt pour une telle tâche.${prompt}
  10247: 'Vous pouvez peut-être prendre ce ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} que j’ai dans le nord, et éviter une catastrophe imminente... Pensez-vous avoir ce qu’il faut ?${prompt}'

  10252: Bon travail ! Je savais que vous pouviez le faire. Mais restez sur vos gardes.{prompt}

  10254: Mmm ? Vous en avez déjà une. Eh bien, c’est très bien - considérez-le comme un cadeau d’adieu.${prompt}
  10255: Bonne chance avec la pétition!${prompt}

  10260: Oh, quel dommage. Au revoir.${prompt}
  10261: Bon, écoutez. L’archiduc est à court de nourriture et de cadeaux pour tous les gros bonnets étrangers qu’il reçoit.${prompt}
  10262: Vous ne trouvez pas qu’il se passe quelque chose de bizarre ? Les ambassadeurs des trois nations ne cessent de passer, et le train des délégués et des caravanes ne s’arrête jamais.${prompt}
  10263: La récompense est vraiment quelque chose. C'est une clé que l’archiduc a lui-même trouvée dans les ruines. On dit qu'elle rend les choses... automatiques. Alors ? Vous voulez l’essayer ?${prompt}
  10264: |-
    Vous voulez essayer ?

  10281: J'ai la chair de poule en regardant depuis le bord. On se rend vraiment compte de l'altitude à laquelle on se trouve. ${prompt}
  10282: Je me demande comment ils ont réussi à construire cet endroit. Jeuno est pleine de mystères, comme les dirigeables ! Mais le plus grand de tous, c'est l'archiduc. Personne ne sait qui il est ni d'où il vient.${prompt}
  10283: Je vous déteste tous!${prompt}
  10284: Un de mes camarades de classe avait l'habitude de crier cela chaque fois qu'il grimpait sur un endroit élevé. Je me demande ce qu'il voulait dire... ${prompt}

    Comment retirer un objet ?
    Ma liste d'état des ventes est pleine !
    Rien pour l'instant.${prompt}
  10310: On trouve des salles des ventes dans toutes les grandes villes de Vana'diel. Les aventuriers s'y retrouvent pour enchérir sur des butins de guerre, des objets indésirables, de vieilles armures... presque tout.${prompt}
  10311: Actuellement, les hôtels des ventes de Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst et Jeuno fonctionnent indépendamment les uns des autres. Les prix varient donc d'une ville à l'autre.${prompt}
  10312: Les aventuriers peuvent utiliser n'importe quel hôtel des ventes, quelle que soit leur nationalité.${prompt}
  10313: Le premier aventurier à enchérir à un prix égal ou supérieur au prix demandé achètera automatiquement le produit.${prompt}
  10314: Une fois mise aux enchères, la marchandise y restera pour un maximum de trente semaines de temps Vana'diel (neuf jours et demi de temps terrestre).${prompt}
  10315: Si la marchandise n'est pas vendue dans ce délai, elle sera retournée à la résidence actuelle du vendeur.${prompt}
  10316: Les frais de transaction sont proportionnels au montant pour lequel un objet est mis aux enchères. La méthode de calcul de ces frais est différente selon qu'il s'agit d'un objet unique ou d'un objet cumulable.${prompt}
  10317: Des frais de transaction sont perçus lors de la mise aux enchères de toute marchandise. Ces frais ne sont pas remboursables.${prompt}
  10318: Le Comité international des maisons de vente, ou IAHC, a déclaré qu'un maximum de sept articles peuvent être mis aux enchères en même temps.${prompt}
  10319: Toutefois, l'IAHC a récemment supprimé la limite du nombre d'objets que l'on peut acheter.${prompt}
  10320: Un petit délai est nécessaire avant que la nouvelle marchandise n'apparaisse sur notre liste d'offres.${prompt}
  10321: Une fois qu'un article apparaît dans votre liste d'état des ventes, il peut ne pas apparaître immédiatement dans la liste des offres. Si vous ne voyez pas votre article sur la liste d'enchères, essayez de regarder à nouveau plus tard.${prompt}
  10322: Si vous souhaitez retirer un objet d'une vente aux enchères, vous devez vous rendre à l'hôtel des ventes et sélectionner « Arrêter la vente » dans le menu « État des ventes ».${prompt}

  10583: Chaque région comprend plusieurs zones, et la nation qui débarrasse ces zones du plus grand nombre de monstres prend le contrôle de la région.${prompt}

  10600: Si nous prenons le contrôle d'une région, des gardes-frontières seront placés à ses avant-postes pour aider les aventuriers comme vous.${prompt}
  10601: Des marchands y seront également installés, et les marchandises de cette région trouveront leur chemin vers les boutiques locales.${prompt}
  10602: Le contrôle des régions est le principe de base des conquêtes. Nous avons besoin de chacun d'entre vous pour faire de son mieux et amener notre nation au sommet de la hiérarchie.${prompt}
  10603: Bien sûr, il arrive que nous perdions des régions au profit d'autres nations... nous devons donc essayer de les reprendre avant que les résultats de la prochaine conquête ne soient annoncés.${prompt}
  10604: Pour vous encourager, nous vous accorderons plus de points de conquête si vous battez des monstres dans ces régions.${prompt}
  10605: Mais si nous sommes alliés à une autre nation, vous n'obtiendrez que le taux normal pour vaincre les monstres dans les régions de nos alliés. En revanche, nous vous accorderons plus de points si vous combattez dans les régions de la nation la mieux classée.${prompt}

    Notre principale préoccupation est que les hommes-bêtes prennent le contrôle de nos régions.
    Si nous sommes trop nombreux à être vaincus dans une région, les hommes-bêtes en prendront le contrôle.${prompt}
  10607: Si cela se produit, non seulement notre fierté en prendra un coup, mais vous ne pourrez plus acquérir de cristaux dans cette région.${prompt}
  10608: Les hommes-bêtes sont une menace pour toutes les nations. S'ils montent en puissance, nous devons tous nous unir et chasser ces viles créatures de cette région.${prompt}

  11047: Personne n'est autorisé à rencontrer l'archiduc ou les scientifiques ducaux, sauf en cas d'absolue nécessité.${prompt}
  11048: Les officiels ont été extrêmement occupés à organiser l'envoi de nombreuses forces expéditionnaires en divers endroits de Quon et de Mindartia.${prompt}
  11049: Si vous avez des affaires avec l'archiduc ou les scientifiques ducaux, veuillez nous laisser votre message et nous le transmettrons aux autorités compétentes.${prompt}
  11050: Cependant, nous ne pouvons pas garantir que vous recevrez une réponse rapide.${prompt}
  11051: Un homme de la Guilde des Alchimistes attend de parler aux scientifiques depuis plusieurs jours.${prompt}
  11052: Je crois qu'il attend toujours quelque part près des quartiers de l'archiduc. Versez l'âme... ${prompt}
  11053: Vous avez entendu ? Certains cristaux de téléportation de Holla, Mea et Dem se sont brisés en mille morceaux!${prompt}
  11054: C'est donc pour cela que le Capitaine Wolfgang est sur les nerfs ces derniers temps... Mais que se passe-t-il vraiment sur ces rochers ? ${prompt}
  11055: Je vois que vous commencez à vous intéresser aux événements étranges qui se sont produits ces dernières semaines.${prompt}
  11056: |-
    Laissez-moi vous raconter un peu ce que j'ai entendu...
    Récemment, le Duché a été envahi par d'étranges histoires de voyageurs attirés par d'étranges tourbillons situés dans les Dunes de Valkurm et sur l'île de Qufim... et qui n'en reviennent jamais.${prompt}
  11057: D'après ce que j'ai compris, les scientifiques ducaux pensent que ce phénomène a quelque chose à voir avec les Télépoints brisés des Crags de Holla, Dem et Mea.${prompt}
  11058: Pour collecter des données, un groupe de gardes ducaux sera envoyé d'un jour à l'autre.${prompt}
  11059: |-
    Etranges tourbillons à Valkurm et Qufim...
    Des télépoints brisés...
    Qu'est-ce que tout cela peut bien signifier?${prompt}
  11060: Le rapport d'enquête rédigé par les gardes ducaux mentionne que les tourbillons de Valkurm et de Qufim sont constitués d'une substance inconnue qu'ils appellent le « Vide ».${prompt}
  11061: |-
    Et maintenant, des rumeurs affirment qu'en sautant dans ces vortex obscurs, les gens peuvent se téléporter instantanément sur l'île perdue de Tavnazia !
    Je ne sais pas ce qu'il en est pour vous, mais moi, je reste ici, en sécurité!${prompt}
  11062: J'ai entendu des rumeurs selon lesquelles une lumière brillante aurait jailli de la mer quelque part au nord de la Tour Delkfutt.${prompt}
  11063: Une équipe d'enquêteurs est prévue pour fouiller la zone à la recherche d'indices, mais ils auront du pain sur la planche. Les courants de la mer de Shu'Meyo sont imprévisibles et violents. Plus d'un capitaine a perdu son navire dans ces eaux.${prompt}
  11064: Saviez-vous qu'il existe à Jeuno un mystérieux groupe de fonctionnaires connu sous le nom de « Société Armathrwn » ?${prompt}
  11065: La dernière fois que j'ai essayé de parler de ce groupe aux nouvelles recrues, le capitaine Wolfgang m'a assigné aux latrines pendant neuf semaines et demie!${prompt}
  11066: Vous, un aventurier dépenaillé, avez parlé à Sir Nag'molada!${prompt}
  11067: Saviez-vous qu'il était un membre haut placé de la prestigieuse Société Armathrwn, les conseillers de l'Archiduc Kam'lanaut ?
  11068: Sir Nag'molada s'entretient souvent avec les gens du peuple du Duché. J'ai même entendu dire que des promotions étaient accordées à ceux qui l'impressionnaient.${prompt}
  11069: Je me demande s'il s'arrêtera un jour pour me parler... Que lui dirais-je ? ${prompt}
  11070: Vous êtes un aventurier, n'est-ce pas ? Vous avez donc probablement déjà entendu parler de l'énorme dragon qui a survolé les cieux de l'Ouest.${prompt}
  11071: Tout le monde a d'abord cru qu'il s'agissait d'une wyvern égarée, mais des rumeurs affirment qu'il s'agit en fait d'un de ces anciens « wyrms » !${prompt}
  11072: Vous voulez en savoir plus sur les fonctionnaires encapuchonnés en robe noire qui apparaissent parfois dans la cour ? ${prompt}
  11073: Ce sont tous des membres de la Société Armathrwn, des scientifiques travaillant pour le Duché. J'ai entendu dire qu'il y avait même quelques femmes parmi eux.${prompt}
  11074: Alors que l'Armada de Jeuno se prépare à la bataille, il est du devoir de la Garde Ducale d'assurer la sécurité des citoyens de Jeuno.${prompt}
  11075: Avez-vous entendu dire qu'une arme super-secrète était en train d'être chargée sur l'un des navires de guerre ? Je me demande ce que cela peut bien être...${prompt}
  11076: Oui, j'ai entendu certains gardes dire que les scientifiques de la société avaient construit une nouvelle machine de combat terrifiante.${prompt}
  11077: D'accord ! Après avoir utilisé cet engin, ainsi que les canons à mammouths ultra-puissants des dirigeables, il ne restera plus assez de ces wyrms pour faire des hamburgers de dragon !${prompt}
  11078: L'Armada de Jeuno se prépare à attaquer le Wyrmking, Bahamut. Cependant, il n'y a aucune raison de s'inquiéter. Nos forces sont les plus puissantes et les plus avancées de tout Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11079: Avez-vous vu un garçon ou une fille à l'allure étrange courir dans les jardins ?${prompt}
  11080: Si c'est le cas, informez l'un des gardes ducaux. Des mandats d'arrêt ont été lancés contre eux. ${prompt}
  11081: |-
    Leur capture est cruciale pour la sécurité de Jeuno, mais aussi de tout Vana'diel.
    Votre aide et celle de vos compagnons d'aventure est grandement appréciée.${prompt}
  11082: |-
    Les membres de la Société Armathrwn doivent accompagner l'armada dans sa mission.
    On dit que ce sont les avancées technologiques de la société qui ont permis de construire cette ville et d'en faire ce qu'elle est aujourd'hui.${prompt}
  11083: Dame Esha'ntarl est censée diriger la mission contre Bahamut. Avec une commandante aussi compétente à la tête de l'armada, rien dans Vana'diel ne peut arrêter le Duché!${prompt}
  11084: Je sais que vous considérez votre nation comme une force puissante dans Vana'diel, mais Jeuno est la seule nation à avoir les ressources nécessaires pour vaincre le Wyrmking. Ne l'oubliez pas.${prompt}
  11085: |-
    L'un des vaisseaux de l'armada a disparu !
    Avec toutes les mesures de sécurité renforcées, comment quelqu'un a-t-il pu réaliser un exploit aussi grandiose que le vol d'un dirigeable!${prompt}
  11086: Alors que l'Armada de Jeuno mène sa mission dans les cieux, la Garde Ducale a pour mission d'assurer la sécurité des citoyens de Jeuno.${prompt}
  11087: Avez-vous découvert quelque chose de plus sur l'arme super secrète que l'armada a emportée avec elle ? ${prompt}
  11088: ' Non... Cependant, j’ai entendu dire que l’appareil avait porté un coup sévère au puissant Wyrmking lors de l’assaut.${prompt}'
  11089: Wowzie ! Si j'avais un tel engin, je mangerais des hamburgers de dragon tous les soirs!${prompt}
  11090: Les derniers rapports indiquent que la mission de l'armada a été un succès. Cependant, elle n'a pas permis d'arrêter complètement le Wyrmking et ses sbires. On dit que la flotte lancera sa deuxième attaque une fois que les réparations des navires de guerre seront terminées.${prompt}
  11091: Si vous avez des informations sur l'endroit où se trouve la jeune fille que le Duché recherchait, je suis désolé, mais le mandat d'arrêt a été abandonné.${prompt}
  11092: La Garde Ducale a récemment reçu des nouvelles de sa mort...${prompt}
  11093: Même avec la technologie de la Société Armathrwn de notre côté, l'armada n'a pas pu vaincre complètement le Wyrmking et son armée. Peut-être avons-nous sous-estimé leur puissance... ${prompt}
  11094: Lors de sa première vague d'attaques, l'armada a réussi à infliger de nombreux dégâts à Bahamut. Le Wyrmking n'aura aucune chance face à la seconde vague.${prompt}
  11095: |-
    <Sigh>
    J'ai demandé à être transféré de la Garde Ducale à l'équipage de l'armada, mais on m'a refusé...${prompt}
  11096: |-
    Pourquoi dois-je rester dans les jardins alors que tout le monde s'amuse ? Regardez-moi ces biceps ! Je pourrais éliminer un wyrm d'un seul coup !
    Enfin... peut-être deux coups.${prompt}
  11097: Nous commencions à nous demander quand vous alliez arriver, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  11098: The duke vicarious is meeting a messenger from the East as we speak. When she is finished, you shall be next. Until then, you shall be kept in custody.${prompt}
  11099: Je m'excuse de l'absence du Grand Duc Kam'lanaut. C'est moi, Esha'ntarl, qui le remplacerai.${prompt}
  11100: J'ai appris que vous veniez de l'Empire de l'Est pour demander quelque chose à notre nation. Indiquez votre nom et votre requête.${prompt}
  11101: '...Je suis Tenzen. Né et élevé en Extrême-Orient, je suis un samouraï de la puissante dynastie.${prompt}'
  11102: Dame Esha'ntarl, puis-je vous demander pourquoi mon audience n'a pas été accueillie par le duc lui-même ??${prompt}
  11103: '${choice: 1}[Depuis la renaissance du Seigneur de l’Ombre/Même après la défaite du Seigneur de l’Ombre], le grand-duc a été submergé par ses devoirs envers le peuple de ce pays.${prompt}'
  11104: Mais ne vous inquiétez pas. Je me chargerai de transmettre vos paroles directement au Seigneur Kam'lanaut. ${prompt}
  11105: Ces deux-là en seront les témoins. ${prompt}
  11106: '...${prompt}'
  11107: Bien que court, mon message n'est pas simple. Il est essentiel que le duc comprenne la gravité de la situation qui nous attend.${prompt}
  11108: Ce que je vais dire n'affecte pas seulement ma patrie, mais les pays au sud et à l'ouest, ainsi que ce beau pays.${prompt}
  11109: |-
    Le vide se rapproche.
    Il est déjà apparu aux confins de l'Empire de l'Est. Je suppose qu'il en va de même dans les régions périphériques du sud et de l'ouest.${prompt}
  11110: Le phénomène a commencé modestement, mais ces derniers mois, il a commencé à prendre de l'ampleur. Comme la sève suinte lentement d'un arbre, le Vide se répand dans mon pays, engloutissant les collines et les forêts.${prompt}
  11111: |-
    A son approche, les enfants se mettent à rêver.
    Lorsqu'il arrive, les adultes ne tardent pas à rêver à leur tour.${prompt}
  11112: |-
    Le rêve est toujours le même...
    Il nous dit que le Gardien de l'Apocalypse apparaîtra bientôt et qu'il apportera avec lui la fin de Vana'diel.${prompt}
  11113: |-
    Le Gardien de l'Apocalypse...
    Un nom effrayant, n'est-ce pas?${prompt}
  11114: Votre rapport sur cette « obscurité » - ce vide - n'est pas nouveau pour nous. Ces dernières semaines, des phénomènes similaires ont été signalés dans les environs de Jeuno.${prompt}
  11115: Cependant, ces rapports indiquent que le Vide, comme vous l'appelez, est localisé. C'est pourquoi nous avons choisi de ne pas divulguer cette information au public jusqu'à ce qu'elle fasse l'objet de recherches plus approfondies. S'il est vrai que le Vide a commencé à se répandre, une enquête immédiate pourrait s'avérer nécessaire.${prompt}
  11116: Le Duché doit-il préparer une équipe?${prompt}
  11117: |-
    ...
    Vous...ne savez pas pourquoi le Vide est apparu ? ${prompt}
  11118: Malheureusement, nos scientifiques ne sont pas encore parvenus à des conclusions concrètes. Si votre empire dispose de données précises, nous serions ravis de les connaître.${prompt}
  11119: Suggérez-vous que la cause du vide se trouve dans mon pays ? Ne me dites pas que vous ignorez que les cinq éclats de la légende reposent ici !${prompt}
  11120: Ne me dites pas que vous ignorez que c'est le pouvoir des cinq éclats qui protège Vana'diel du Vide!${prompt}
  11121: |-
    Tenzen de l'Est...
    Vous êtes très direct dans vos accusations. ${prompt}
  11122: |-
    Voyons voir...
    Vous pensez que Jeuno est à l'origine de la croissance du Vide.
    Vous pensez que nos tentatives d'exploiter le pouvoir des cristaux ont entraîné la propagation des ténèbres, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
  11123: Je suis désolé de vous dire que vous vous trompez. Jeuno est parfaitement conscient de la puissance que les cristaux dégagent.${prompt}
  11124: Ce sont les cinq éclats, les cristaux-mères, qui soutiennent notre monde.${prompt}
  11125: Nous, le Duché, avons pris sur nous d'hériter de la volonté des anciens et de protéger les ruines zilartiennes et les cristaux qu'elles contiennent.${prompt}
  11126: Nous avons caché cette information aux nations de Bastok, Windurst et San d'Oria afin de protéger les cristaux-mères de ceux qui voudraient utiliser leur pouvoir à des fins personnelles.${prompt}
  11127: Je vois que l'Empire de l'Est a appris l'existence des cristaux, et nous ne pouvons donc plus vous faire confiance non plus.${prompt}
  11128: Jeuno ne peut pas laisser le pouvoir des cristaux-mères tomber entre les mains de ceux qui pourraient l'exploiter.${prompt}
  11129: Le seul souhait de mon pays est d'empêcher le Vide de prendre plus qu'il n'a déjà!${prompt}${prompt}
  11130: Voir, de vos propres yeux, les ténèbres drainer la vie de votre patrie... je comprends que vous ne soyez pas d'accord avec la position de notre nation.${prompt}
  11131: |-
    Très bien. Je peux vous dire une chose.
    Le Duché est actuellement à la recherche d'un garçon. On pense que ce garçon est lié d'une manière ou d'une autre au Vide.${prompt}
  11132: Même s'il n'est pas l'un des nôtres, il s'est déjà introduit dans trois des ruines zilartiennes, le Vide suivant son chemin.${prompt}
  11133: Nous pensons que ce garçon est le Gardien de l'Apocalypse dont vous parlez.${prompt}

  11164: Maintenant que nous connaissons la véritable identité du garçon, il n'y a plus de raison de soupçonner l'implication de votre nation. Je m'excuse de ne pas vous avoir fait confiance.${prompt}

  11174: Nous ne voulons pas la punir. Nous pensons qu'elle est en grand danger. Nous devons la retrouver pour pouvoir la protéger.${prompt}
  11175: La première menace qui pèsera sur elle sera Nag'molada. Il tente déjà de faire croire que la chute du quatrième cristal est de la faute de la jeune fille.${prompt}
  11176: S'il la trouve, il lui empoisonnera probablement l'esprit, l'empêchant de parler de tout ce qui pourrait nuire à son plan.${prompt}
  11177: La deuxième menace sera le garçon Selh'teus. Sa prochaine destination sera certainement le cinquième et dernier cristal.${prompt}
  11178: Mais ce cristal se trouve dans les profondeurs de la mer, et la seule à savoir comment l'atteindre est la jeune fille.${prompt}
  11179: Enfin, la troisième menace sera constituée par des assassins venus du sud. ${prompt}
  11180: Vous avez peut-être déjà entendu les rumeurs sur les chasseurs de péchés de Mithran qui ont traversé les mers du sud pour juger les théologiens de Tavnazia.${prompt}
  11181: Ces chasseurs n'abandonneront pas tant qu'ils n'auront pas puni tous ceux qu'ils recherchent.${prompt}

  11186: Mon plan était parfait ! Sans cette ignoble fille, Prishe, j'aurais capturé Selh'teus, et toute cette affaire serait résolue!${prompt}
  11187: Cette fille a entendu le murmure de l'âme de Selh'teus, a chanté la « Memoria de la Stona » et l'a aidé à s'échapper!${prompt}
  11188: Le « testament d'affinité » qu'elle possède relie les coeurs et les âmes des hommes. Selh'teus s'en est servi pour la contrôler!${prompt}

  11190: Mais nous avons maintenant la chance de découvrir ses véritables intentions.${prompt}
  11191: Si nous parvenons à capturer la fille, nous pourrons l'utiliser pour pénétrer l'esprit de Selh'teus. Nous saurons s'il est vraiment venu pour sauver Al'Taieu!${prompt}

    Espèce de misérable!
    Êtes-vous en train de dire que Selh'teus ne sait pas que notre croisade s'est terminée il y a longtemps?${prompt}

    Espèce d'imbécile!
    Êtes-vous en train de dire que Selh'teus ne sait pas que la capitale céleste a été détruite il y a longtemps?${prompt}

  11195: Je propose d'envoyer une expédition à Al'Taieu.${prompt}
  11196: Nous saurons peut-être pourquoi Selh'teus a survécu à tous les siècles et pourquoi il continue d'empoisonner les cristaux-mères.${prompt}
  11197: C'est pourquoi nous devons d'abord étudier la ligne menant au cinquième cristal.${prompt}
  11198: Accordez-moi l'accès au terminal de cristal!${prompt}

  11208: 'Nag''molada, ne vous méprenez pas. ${choice: 0}[La société/Kam''lanaut] n’a pas l’intention de s’intéresser à vos fautes.${prompt}'
  11209: Si nous vous avons confié l'enquête sur les Moblins, c'est parce que vos excellents pouvoirs de négociation kuluu sont essentiels à la réussite de la mission.${prompt}
  11210: Mais Dame Esha'ntarl ! Vous ne réalisez pas à quel point le garçon est devenu puissant...${prompt}
  11211: Maintenant que l'Oeil a disparu et que le chemin vers le cinquième cristal est scellé, comment comptez-vous vous occuper de lui?${prompt}
  11212: Je ne pense pas que tu aies un plan !${prompt}
  11213: Très bien, laissez-moi vous expliquer comment nous comptons arrêter Selh'teus.${prompt}

    Nous pouvons l'attirer sans voyager jusqu'au cinquième cristal.

    Quelle est la véritable nature de cet autre monde ? Je ne peux l'expliquer que comme un endroit qui se trouve au-delà des limites de notre connaissance.

  11309: Les hommes-bêtes de ce monde portent le butin des batailles précédentes. Un équipement que vous ou moi utiliserions.${prompt}
  11310: Je ne peux pas les toucher sous ma forme actuelle, mais je ressens quelque chose à propos de ces armes et armures... quelque chose d'extraordinaire.${prompt}

    Mais assez parlé de ce genre de choses, les félicitations sont de rigueur !

  11314: Mais d'abord, vous devez collecter les trois autres trophées et vous rendre en toute hâte sur le glacier enneigé de Beaucedine. Cornelia devrait être là-haut à vous attendre.${prompt}

    Le ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} et le ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.

  11319: |-
    À moins que le linceul des ténèbres ne soit levé, ce pouvoir ne suffira pas à ouvrir la voie.

    Oui. Du centre des ténèbres infinies.
    J'étais dans un endroit incompréhensible lorsque ces mots ont atteint mon esprit...${prompt}

    Toi qui as touché le cristal, toi qui détiens un pouvoir immortel dans une enveloppe mortelle.
    La rage qui a surgi de ton cœur tordu dévorera mon monde.${prompt}

    Alors que cette question rongeait mon esprit, la voix se taisait, me laissant dans un silence sans réponse.${prompt}
  11334: |-
    J'étais certain d'une chose.
    Cette voix appartenait au souverain de Dynamis.${prompt}
  11335: Il existe à Vana'diel un flux d'énergie qui a échappé à ceux qui y vivent.${prompt}
  11336: |-
    Il y a trente ans, mon contact avec le cristal a provoqué un changement accéléré dans ce flux.
    C'était comme s'il avait fait un bond en avant, se précipitant sur une trajectoire délibérée. ${prompt}

    Personne ne sait ce qui nous attend au bout de ce voyage.
    Peut-être révélera-t-il la vraie nature de Vana'diel.${prompt}

    Ce devoir est trop lourd à porter pour un seul.
    Si vous voulez de moi, je resterai à vos côtés jusqu'à ce qu'une ère sans haine soit arrivée.
    Il m'est pénible de voir à quel point mon pays est tombé bas.${prompt}

    Allez, un peu d'animation !
    C'est la réunion des trente ans de notre expédition.${prompt}
  11347: |-
    Ce n'est pas les Terres du Nord cette fois.
    Aucun d'entre nous ne va vieillir et mourir, alors qui d'autre voudriez-vous accompagner dans une tâche aussi longue que celle-ci ?${prompt}
  11348: |-
    Je ne reculerai pas, même si tu te plains.
    Mieux vaut céder et accepter le fait que tu es coincé avec moi. ${prompt}

    Je pensais que c'était la fin pour toi...
    Hmph. Tu as la peau aussi dure qu'avant.${prompt}

    Quoi, pas de mots pour un vieil ami ?
    Tu penses tester ta théorie sur le fait qu'une âme peut être tuée ou non ?${prompt}

    Je t'ai trahi !
    J'ai éteint la lumière de ta précieuse Cornelia !
    L'homme responsable de ce cauchemar se tient devant vous!${prompt}

    Tout a commencé il y a trente ans.

    Raogrimm.
    Il n'est plus nécessaire de souffrir seul.
    Notre présence ici devrait répondre à votre question.${prompt}

    Il y a des crimes qui doivent être expiés.

  11649: The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt}
  11650: First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt}
  11651: At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt}
  11652: Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt}
  11653: The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt}
  11654: The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
  11655: If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
  11656: Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
  11657: You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
  11658: No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
  11659: 'The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides'' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}'
  11660: 'Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}'
  11661: “LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
  11662: A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
  11663: The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
  11664: If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
  11665: After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
  11666: Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
  11667: In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
  11668: Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
  11669: 'Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}'

  11673: 'The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player''s speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}'
  11674: In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
  11675: In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}

  12022: Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word “ballista” means “to throw a stone,” and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.${prompt}
  12023: |-
    The rules are simple.
    Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.${prompt}
  12024: 'Players from both teams must search for ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} that a ${color: 5}Herald${color: 1} has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12025: 'These ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} into them.${prompt}'
  12026: Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.${prompt}
  12027: '${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the ${color: 5}Quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.${prompt}'
  12028: 'Sometimes a player may find items other than ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}, such as potions. These ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).${prompt}'
  12029: |-
    Players can carry more than one ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them.
    However, players will lose their ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} if they:
    (1) Successfully throw them into a rook.
    (2) Leave the area.
    (3) Are knocked out.${prompt}
  12030: 'But don''t forget, a player will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command while in possession of a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. And, players can only use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command if they carry one of the stones.${prompt}'
  12031: As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.${prompt}
  12032: 'All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. This will temporarily increase one''s movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12033: 'However, remember that once a player has obtained a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}, he or she will be unable to use the ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} command. In its place, though, one may use the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command.${prompt}'
  12034: 'The locations of the ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1} are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.${prompt}'
  12035: 'Communication with one''s team members is, of course, one way to locate ${color: 5}Rooks${color: 1}. However, another way is by using the ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}.${prompt}'
  12036: 'Finally, ${color: 5}Scout${color: 1} can only be used when a player is carrying a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1}. Because ${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.${prompt}'
  12037: 'So, a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} has been obtained and a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1} located. Now all that''s left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.${prompt}'
  12038: There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.${prompt}
  12039: 'To throw a ${color: 5}Petra${color: 1} into a ${color: 5}Rook${color: 1}, a player must first wait until the ${color: 5}Rook''s${color: 1} gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.${prompt}'
  12040: |-
    But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve ${color: 5}Gate Breach${color: 1} status.
    Only then will his or her shots count.${prompt}
  12041: This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.${prompt}
  12042: Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.${prompt}
  12043: |-
    The following match types are area-specific:
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest
    All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands
    Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains${prompt}
  12044: |-
    ${color: 5}Best of Three${color: 1} series rules are as follows:
    Winning a match will earn a nation one “match point.” The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for “come-from-behind” victories.${prompt}
  12045: Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.${prompt}
  12046: Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.${prompt}
  12047: When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.${prompt}
  12048: For more information on temporary items, refer to the “special rules.”${prompt}
  12049: After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.${prompt}
  12050: If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.${prompt}
  12051: |-
    Please note that many of the rules previously considered “special” have been fully implemented.
    Also, several new special rules have been added.${prompt}

  12053: 'Previously, participants in Ballista were required to use an item the moment they dug it up using the /quarry command. However, players can now stock these items as ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} for use at any time during the match.${prompt}'
  12054: 'Players can hold up to ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1}, but only one of each type. If a player finds an item that they already possess, they must use it immediately or throw it away.${prompt}'
  12055: 'If players who possess ten ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} find an item that they have not already obtained, they will also have the option to exchange it with one of their current items.${prompt}'
  12056: Also, players will not, at any time, be allowed to trade temporary items. However, there are items that can be used on other Ballista participants. Please note that players may not be able to use these special items as soon as they are quarried.${prompt}
  12057: 'Finally, the Heralds will collect ${color: 5}temporary items${color: 1} when the match (the third in a Best of Three series) has concluded.${prompt}'

  12143: 'Ces derniers mois, j’ai découvert que ce type d’expérience s’accumule dans votre corps sous une forme complètement différente - une sorte de super expérience, si vous voulez. J’ai donné à ce phénomène le nom de ${color: 5}points limite${color: 1}, kupo!${prompt}'

    Les tablettes renferment de nombreux secrets que nous, les moogles, n'avons pas encore percés, kupo.

  12146: J'étais justement en train de discuter de ce sujet avec un ami de la Magian Mooglehood... C'est alors que j'ai été frappé à la tête comme un troupeau d'hécatombes!${prompt}
  12147: Et si les anciens arts moogle pouvaient être utilisés pour augmenter non seulement les biens des aventuriers, mais aussi les aventuriers eux-mêmes, kupo !${prompt}
  12148: |-
    En utilisant ma connaissance des points de mérite et en faisant appel à la maîtrise martiale de Maat, j'ai mis au point une méthode qui pourrait bien fonctionner!

  12153: '...en mode d’accumulation de points de limite, vous recevrez des points de limite après chaque combat. C’est aussi simple que ça, kupo!${prompt}'
  12154: Oh, et au fait, si vous êtes toujours en mode d'accumulation de points d'expérience après avoir atteint le maximum d'EXP, tous les combats menés à partir de ce moment-là vous rapporteront des points de limite, quel que soit le mode dans lequel vous vous trouvez, kupo !${prompt}
  12155: Normalement, vous ne pouvez accumuler des points de limite que lorsque vous jouez à un emploi qui a atteint le niveau 75 ou plus. Il y a cependant une exception :kupo !${prompt}
  12156: Lorsqu'un travail permettant de recevoir des points de limitation a été réduit par une restriction de niveau, vous pouvez toujours gagner des points de limitation en battant des ennemis!${prompt}
  12157: N'oubliez pas de changer de mode avant de partir à la chasse ! Lorsque vous êtes en mode d'accumulation de points de limite, la couleur du texte dans la fenêtre « Statut » change légèrement pour vous le faire savoir, kupo !${prompt}
  12158: Enfin, si vous baissez de niveau ou changez de job alors que vous êtes en mode d'accumulation de points de limite, vous repasserez automatiquement en mode d'accumulation de points d'expérience.${prompt}
  12159: 'Ah, et un dernier conseil : Vous pouvez toujours vérifier le nombre de points de limite et de points de mérite que vous avez gagnés en consultant le menu « Points de mérite ».${prompt}'
  12160: Ummm, tout d'abord, vous pouvez vérifier le nombre de points de mérite que vous avez accumulés en appuyant sur le bouton « Points de mérite » sous « Statut » dans le menu principal.${prompt}
  12161: Les données que j'ai recueillies jusqu'à présent m'indiquent qu'il est assez difficile d'augmenter ces attributs, et qu'il semble y avoir une limite à l'augmentation d'un certain attribut, kupo.${prompt}
  12162: Il semble également que certains attributs et compétences soient liés d'une manière ou d'une autre. J'appelle ces groupes des « catégories ».
  12163: Par exemple, imaginons que les attributs de la catégorie « HP/MP » puissent être augmentés une « combinaison » de sept fois, kupo.${prompt}
  12164: Cela signifie que si vous augmentez votre « HP maximum » cinq fois, vous ne pouvez augmenter votre « MP maximum » que deux fois.${prompt}
  12165: En d'autres termes, vous ne pouvez pas augmenter tous les attributs jusqu'à leur limite. Le corps doit maintenir un certain équilibre, sinon il explosera ! Ou quelque chose comme ça, kupo.${prompt}
  12166: Il existe également un moyen d'abaisser les attributs qui ont été poussés au-delà de leurs limites. Malheureusement, chaque fois que l'on essaie de le faire, on perd les points de mérite utilisés pour augmenter cet attribut, kupo...${prompt}
  12167: Oh, et enfin, il y a des attributs et des compétences dans la même catégorie qui ont des limites différentes. Je ne suis pas encore sûr de tout cela, alors je vous suggère de demander conseil à vos amis de niveau 75, kupo!${prompt}

  12505: S'occuper des troupeaux de moutons sauvages et les compter un par un lorsqu'il n'arrive pas à dormir...${prompt}
  12506: |-
    ...et bien pire encore.
    Rien que d'y penser, j'en ai des frissons dans le dos...${prompt}
  12507: |-
    Ah, kupo !
    Il s'agit là d'un arrangement tout à fait épouvantable!${prompt}
  12508: |-
    Attendez un peu.
    Comment se fait-il que vous soyez au courant de tous ces détails, Maat?${prompt}
  12509: |-
    Hm !? Des rumeurs, c'est tout!
    Quand on est dans les parages depuis aussi longtemps que moi, on entend une chose ou deux!${prompt}
  12510: |-
    Quoi qu'il en soit, assez parlé !
    Mon régime d'entraînement quotidien est le suivant!${prompt}
  12511: |-
    Venez maintenant, ${name-player}.
    Ce n'est pas le moment d'affaisser les épaules et de perdre le moral.${prompt}
  12512: |-
    Après tout, je suis sûr que cela fait partie de votre entraînement.
    Continuez comme ça, et vous serez très vite en pleine possession de vos moyens!${prompt}
  12513: |-
    Tu avais raison, mon vieil ami.
    Je n'ai jamais pensé quearu ${choice-player-gender}[he'd/she'd] arriver jusqu'ici...${prompt}
  12514: |-
    C'est mon ${name-player}.
    Depuis que je connais ${choice-player-gender}[lui/elle], je n'ai jamais connu ${choice-player-gender}[lui/elle] reculer devant un défi.${prompt}
  12515: Pourquoi, quand je pense à l'époque où ${choice-player-gender}[il/elle] était encore un débutant avec plus d'ambition que de bon sens...${prompt}
  12516: |-
    ...<Sniff>...
    C'est bizarre, j'ai l'impression d'avoir de l'eau dans les yeux...${prompt}
  12517: Epargne-moi ces larmes, Maat.${prompt}
  12518: Tandis que les réalisations de ${name-player} sont admirables, les aventuriers qui s'efforcent d'atteindre le sommet de leurs pouvoirs sont rares.${prompt}
  12519: |-
    Nous ne devons pas les ménager.
    Car c'est entre leurs mains que repose le destin de notre Vana'diel...${prompt}
  12520: Votre limite de niveau est maintenant de 99!
  12521: |-
    Parler de la ${choice-player-gender}[sauveur/starlette], kupo.
    Je viens d'entendre une exhortation passionnante sur le thème de l'éducation et de la formation. “${color: 5}points de job${color: 1}” et je me suis dit qu'il fallait absolument que je vous en informe immédiatement!${prompt}
  12522: Les aventuriers accomplis comme vous peuvent accumuler ces points en progressant de manière prolifique dans leur profession. Mais attention, le chemin est plus rocailleux que tout ce qui concerne les points de limite, kupo.${prompt}
  12523: '...Cependant, je suis persuadé que vous saurez vaincre la corne d’abondance de crêpes et de sabots qui pourraient vous barrer la route de la gloire.${prompt}'
  12524: |-
    Pensez-vous avoir ce qu'il faut?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sans aucun doute!
    Pas pour le moment...${prompt}
  12525: |-
    C'est ce que je voulais entendre, kupo!
    Votre détermination m'emplit d'une grande joie.${prompt}
  12526: Désormais, vous pourrez sélectionner « Points de job » dans le menu « Statut » tant que votre job principal aura atteint le resplendissant royaume du niveau 99, kupo.${prompt}
  12527: Vous pouvez y jouer avec ferveur, mais seulement à l'intérieur de votre maison Mog ou en galopant dans votre jardin Mog.${prompt}
  12528: Le ${name-npc} vous jette un sort étrange et légèrement troublant.${prompt}
  12529: Hmph, et moi qui pensais que vous débordiez d'audace et de bravoure. Eh bien, parle-moi quand tes tripes te donneront le feu vert, kupo !${prompt}
  12530: Ces trois étoiles qui brillent au-dessus de votre tête sont une source d'inspiration indescriptible, kupo!${prompt}
  12531: Et vous cherchez sûrement plus de force superlative!${prompt}
  12532: |-
    Comment réagissez-vous ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Il doit avoir plus de puissance...
    Je suis assez fort, merci.${prompt}
  12533: Les épreuves et les tribulations auxquelles vous devez faire face sont terrifiantes, kupo. Êtes-vous absolument certain?${prompt}
  12534: |-
    Êtes-vous positif ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sans aucun doute.
    Pas si c'est dur...${prompt}
  12535: Alors je vous lègue un outil précieux :le maître briseur!${prompt}
  12536: Grâce à lui, vous pourrez passer au niveau de maître pour les tâches que vous maitrisez, kupo.${prompt}
  12537: Ce n'est qu'en combattant les méchants les plus turbulents que vous pourrez augmenter votre niveau de maître.${prompt}
  12538: Hélas, je crains que si vous tombez, votre niveau de maître ne diminue également, kupo.${prompt}
  12539: Vous pouvez vérifier votre niveau de maître actuel via le menu principal si votre job principal est de niveau 99 et que vous avez atteint le statut de maître du job.${prompt}
  12540: L'augmentation de votre niveau de maître vous permettra d'augmenter un certain nombre d'attributs, alors faites de votre mieux!${prompt}
  12541: Je vous attendrai ici quand vous serez prêt. ${prompt}
  12542: ${name-npc} vous enchante d'une force terrifiante.${prompt}
  12543: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Qu'avez-vous à faire ici aujourd'hui ?
    Si vous cherchez le capitaine Wolfgang, il est actuellement...${prompt}
  12544: |-
    Vous êtes ici pour la fille, Prishe ?
    Et du mandat d'arrêt?${prompt}
  12545: Elle s'est présentée au palais de son plein gré, il n'y a pas si longtemps. ${prompt}
  12546: Naturellement, elle a été placée en détention, mais ses demandes d'audience auprès d'une autorité supérieure se font de plus en plus pressantes.${prompt}
  12547: Je me demande si le capitaine Wolfgang reviendra bientôt...${prompt}
  12548: ${name-player}!${prompt}
  12549: Je m'excuse d'interrompre votre conversation, mais... pourriez-vous marcher avec moi un moment?${prompt}
  12550: Pourquoi Prishe se rendrait-elle si facilement... ?${prompt}
  12551: Je n'ai aucune idée de ce qu'elle peut penser.${prompt}
  12552: Remercions la miséricorde d'Altana que Prishe ait échappé à toute punition alors que le gouvernement Jeunoan est occupé par d'autres affaires.${prompt}
  12553: Si seulement nous pouvions profiter de cette occasion pour la sauver d'une manière ou d'une autre...${prompt}
  12554: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Dame Ulmia!
  12555: Tenzen!${prompt}
  12556: |-
    Je suis heureux de vous avoir trouvée.
    Vous avez entendu parler de la situation difficile de la jeune Dame Prishe?${prompt}
  12557: Nous devons rassembler tout le monde pour unir nos actions et planifier notre prochain mouvement.${prompt}
  12558: Le reste de nos amis nous attendent dans une taverne de Upper Jeuno.${prompt}
  12559: Une taverne à Upper Jeuno...?${prompt}
  12560: Aldo a usé de son influence pour obtenir l'établissement à notre usage exclusif, même si ce n'est que pour un temps.${prompt}
  12561: |-
    Je vous attendrai sur place.
    D'ici là.${prompt}
  12562: Quel peut être le but de cette réunion au Pont de Marbre dans le Haut Jeuno?${prompt}
  12563: Si cet Aldo est impliqué, je suis certain qu'il ne peut s'agir de rien de bon. Laissez-moi en dehors de ça. Si je perds ce travail, c'est fini pour moi!${prompt}
  12564: ${name-player}.${prompt}
  12565: |-
    Je dois m'excuser pour mon comportement puéril.
    Je n'aurais jamais dû m'enfuir dans un tel état d'agitation.${prompt}
  12566: Je comprends ce que tout le monde dit.${prompt}
  12567: Je comprends que le Wyrmking, Bahamut, projette d'anéantir tous les peuples de Vana'diel.${prompt}
  12568: Même avec la puissance de l'Armada de Jeuno, beaucoup plus de vies innocentes seront perdues dans ce conflit si rien n'est fait.${prompt}
  12569: Et je comprends que tout le monde souhaite vraiment sauver Prishe de son destin...${prompt}
  12570: |-
    Cependant, comme l'a dit Lord Diabolos.
    Nous ne pouvons pas sauver à la fois le monde et tout son peuple.${prompt}
  12571: |-
    Le seigneur Diabolos...
    Je me demande s'il a appelé Prishe dans son monde des rêves parce qu'il connaissait la vérité sur son identité, à savoir qu'elle est la gardienne de l'Apocalypse.${prompt}
  12572: |-
    Le Cardinal Mildaurion était-il également conscient de cette vérité?
    Est-ce pour cela qu'elle a donné cette amulette à Prishe?
    Mais je...${prompt}
  12573: ${name-player}, il est peut-être trop tard, mais je dois vous dire quelque chose.${prompt}
  12574: Lorsque Prishe s'est effondrée et que son amulette a été volée...${prompt}
  12575: Cela n'a duré qu'une seconde, mais je suis presque sûr qu'il n'y a pas de problème.${prompt}
  12576: |-
    La présence que j'ai ressentie quand l'amulette a été volée...
    C'était bien Mlle Mildaurion!${prompt}
  12577: Vous dites que le Cardinal Mildaurion vous a pris l'amulette?${prompt}
  12578: |-
    Pourquoi aurait-elle agi de la sorte ?
    Le cardinal ne vous a-t-il pas offert l'amulette en cadeau ? ${prompt}
  12579: |-
    Oui, c'est vrai.
    Mlle Mildaurion veillait toujours sur moi grâce à l'amulette.${prompt}
  12580: Elle s'assurait toujours que je ne pensais pas à faire quelque chose de stupide ou à me mettre dans le pétrin.${prompt}
  12581: Mais elle devait reprendre l'amulette.${prompt}
  12582: Un vieil ami qu'elle avait attendu très longtemps était enfin revenu...${prompt}
  12583: |-
    Elle s'est excusée auprès de moi dans ses pensées.
    Elle m'a dit que je serais en sécurité pendant mon séjour à Jeuno...${prompt}
  12584: Mais ensuite...${prompt}
  12585: Le cardinal Mildaurion aurait su que nous, les survivants de la Grande Guerre, ne pouvions pas quitter l'île...${prompt}
  12586: |-
    Elle savait, mais elle n'est pas venue nous aider.
    Elle nous a abandonnés à notre sort...?${prompt}
  12587: |-
    Non, je ne crois pas.
    Mlle Mildaurion me l'a laissé.${prompt}
  12588: Vous a laissé quoi...?${prompt}
  12589: Qu'allait dire Prishe, je me le demande.${prompt}
  12590: |-
    Qu'est-ce que le Cardinal Mildaurion a bien pu nous confier ?
    Sûrement pas la résurrection du Dieu du Crépuscule...?${prompt}
  12591: Il est peut-être naïf de ma part de croire que vous êtes de mon côté.${prompt}
  12592: Cependant, je ne suis pas prêt à abandonner.${prompt}
  12593: Je veux chanter un monde où Vana'diel et son peuple seront sauvés.${prompt}
  12594: Voulez-vous rêver d'un tel monde avec moi?${prompt}
  12595: |-
    Osez-vous rêver ?
    ${selection-lines}
    Oui, je me battrai jusqu'au bout!
    La réalité n'est pas de ce genre...${prompt}
  12596: Merci, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  12597: |-
    Je suis désolée.
    J'ai trop demandé sans tenir compte de vos sentiments.${prompt}
  12598: |-
    Je vais de nouveau me rendre au Palais du Grand-Duc.
    Je n'ai trouvé personne en ville qui ait des informations, mais Makki-Chebukki et les autres ont probablement suivi quelques rumeurs.${prompt}
  12599: |-
    Il doit y avoir quelque chose à faire pour sauver Prishe...
    Il doit bien y avoir quelqu'un qui connaît le cardinal...${prompt}
  12600: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Que faites-vous ici ?!?${prompt}
  12601: Avez-vous trouvé un moyen d'arrêter le Wyrmking, Bahamut?${prompt}
  12602: |-
    La bataille va bientôt commencer.
    Un dirigeable transportant un groupe d'aventuriers a été abattu lors d'une attaque des wyrms..${prompt}
  12603: Nous avons terminé les préparatifs sur les navires de guerre, et il ne reste plus rien à faire.${prompt}
  12604: |-
    Seulement...
    Je ne sais pas si c'est une bonne ou une mauvaise nouvelle pour vous, mais la commandante de l'armada jeunoise, Lady Esha'ntarl, est introuvable!${prompt}
  12605: |-
    Le Seigneur Nag'molada a également disparu sans la moindre escorte...
    Bon sang ! Ce n'est pas de votre fait, n'est-ce pas?${prompt}
  12606: |-
    C'est vous qui l'avez fait?
    ${selection-lines}
    Cela fait partie de mon plan.
    Bien sûr que non!${prompt}
  12607: |-
    S'il vous plait, ${name-player}, Ce n'est pas le moment de faire des sarcasmes.
    Pardonnez mes accusations sauvages.${prompt}
  12608: |-
    Je vous prie de m'excuser.
    Vous devez pardonner mes accusations sauvages.${prompt}
  12609: Peu importe à quel point on méprise les effusions de sang, il y a peu de gens qui peuvent rester là alors que leur maison est réduite en cendres.${prompt}
  12610: Si je dois sauver Jeuno des wyrms, je n'ai d'autre choix que de coopérer avec cette race d'anciens.${prompt}
  12611: |-
    Capitaine Wolfgang !
    Les criminels qui se sont échappés avec le vaisseau de guerre zéro-trois ont été identifiés!${prompt}
  12612: |-
    Il semble que ce soit l'œuvre de ces trois Tarutaru !
    Nous avons un témoin qui les a entendus parler de se diriger vers un endroit qu'ils appelaient la « terre fatale ».${prompt}
  12613: |-
    Ils ont pris un navire de guerre ?
    Est-il possible qu'ils sachent où se trouvent nos fonctionnaires disparus!?${prompt}
  12614: |-
    Et où se trouve cette « terre de destin » dont ils ont parlé ?
    Séparons-nous et trouvons des réponses!${prompt}
  12615: Où peut bien se trouver cette « terre de destin » ? Je ne saurais même pas où commencer à chercher. ${prompt}
  12616: Maintenant que j'y pense, j'aurais juré avoir déjà entendu ce nom quelque part... Où était-ce... ? ${prompt}
  12617: |-
    Vous, les aventuriers, êtes prompts à entendre les nouvelles !
    Dame Esha'ntarl nous est revenue !${prompt}
  12618: L'armada Jeunoan a été autorisée à lancer l'assaut contre les wyrms!${prompt}
  12619: |-
    Nous procédons aux dernières inspections en vol de tous les vaisseaux.
    Veuillez rester à l'écart et permettre aux ingénieurs de faire leur travail.${prompt}
  12620: Waaah! <sniff>
  12621: Waaah! <snuffle>
  12622: Waaah! <gurgle>
  12623: |-
    Quel racket!
    Ces Tarutaru ont été punis pour avoir volé un navire de guerre et s'être envolés de Jeuno.${prompt}
  12624: 'Ils affirment qu’ils n’ont fait qu’obéir aux ordres, mais Seigneur Nag’molada est également en attente d’une action disciplinaire qui sera décidée par le ${choice: 0}[Société Armathrwn/archiduc].${prompt}'
  12625: Quelle que soit votre position, si vous enfreignez la loi...${prompt}
  12626: Hm ? Cette dame n'est-elle pas une de vos amies?${prompt}
  12627: Oh, vous trois!${prompt}
  12628: Quel est le problème?${prompt}
  12629: |-
    Allons, plus de larmes.
    Les choses ne vont pas si mal ? ${prompt}
  12630: Nous sommes foutus. ${prompt}
  12631: Notre cou est sur le billot.${prompt}
  12632: Il faut sortir d'ici!${prompt}
  12633: |-
    Pourquoi ?
    Des rumeurs courent dans toute la ville sur le courageux Tarutaru qui a sauvé un important fonctionnaire.${prompt}
  12634: Y a-t-il un autre échec terrible que vous regrettez?${prompt}
  12635: |-
    Non, nous avons tout fait correctement.
    Nous avons utilisé le bon mélange de tromperie et de trahison, de miel et de vinaigre...${prompt}
  12636: Nous avons soudoyé les habitants et évité les autorités...${prompt}
  12637: Nous sommes devenus les candidats parfaits pour devenir les bureaucrates du futur...${prompt}
  12638: Ils ont dû s'enfuir parce que je me suis montré.${prompt}
  12639: Prishe!${prompt}
  12640: |-
    Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas chez vous?
    Si tu continues comme ça, je vais commencer à repenser mon plan de te mettre à la tête de Tavnazia.${prompt}
  12641: |-
    Reprenez-vous, ou je vous envoie au prochain Jour de l'Eau !
    Vous avez la responsabilité de veiller sur Ulmia et sur tous les autres membres du Marquisat!${prompt}
  12642: Qu-Quoi ? ${prompt}
  12643: Désolé de m'envoler sans explication, Ulmia.${prompt}
  12644: |-
    Et vous, ${name-player}.
    Merci de vous inquiéter pour moi.${prompt}
  12645: |-
    Nous n'avons pas beaucoup de temps, mais je vais vous dire ce que je sais.
    Allez dans la salle d'audience.${prompt}
  12646: Prishe...?${prompt}
  12647: |-
    Ah, cette jeune fille énergique d'Elvaan vient d'entrer dans la salle d'audience.
    Hmmm... Je pensais qu'elle avait été placée en détention...${prompt}
  12648: Avec tous les préparatifs pour le lancement de l'armada, il ne reste plus grand monde dans le Grand Palais. Je me demande qui a autorisé la jeune fille à entrer... ${prompt}
  12649: |-
    Bonjour, Ulmia.
    Vous avez traversé une sacrée épreuve. ${prompt}
  12650: C-Cardinal Mildaurion...!${prompt}
  12651: Que se passe-t-il... ? ${prompt}
  12652: |-
    Je suis désolé, Ulmia.
    Nous n'avons pas le temps pour de longues explications. ${prompt}
  12653: Cependant, il y a une chose que je dois vous dire.${prompt}
  12654: Mon vrai nom est Esha'ntarl.${prompt}
  12655: Il y a dix mille ans, je suis née à Al'Taieu, la cité qui renferme le cinquième cristal-mère.${prompt}
  12656: Nag'molada, et les autres membres de la Société Armathrwn qui gouvernent aujourd'hui Jeuno, appartiennent eux aussi à une race ancienne, une race qui s'est récemment réveillée d'un sommeil séculaire.${prompt}
  12657: |-
    Mais je suis différent des autres.
    Par un coup du sort, l'immortalité m'a été accordée.${prompt}
  12658: '!?${prompt}'
  12659: J'ai promis d'utiliser cette vie sans fin pour mener à bien le pacte conclu entre Selh'teus et les avatars terrestres.${prompt}
  12660: |-
    Après dix mille ans, un enfant du destin devait naître sur la terre du destin.
    Le Gardien de l'Apocalypse... celui que j'ai juré de détruire.${prompt}
  12661: J'ai passé de nombreuses années à me préparer à la venue du gardien.${prompt}
  12662: Le voyage a été incroyablement long. ${prompt}
  12663: J'ai voyagé jusqu'aux confins de Vana'diel à la recherche de secrets perdus...${prompt}
  12664: J'ai trouvé réconfort et encouragement dans les nombreuses rencontres que j'ai faites en chemin...${prompt}
  12665: Mais quand je suis arrivé à un certain endroit, j'ai été averti:${prompt}
  12666: Détruire le Gardien de l'Apocalypse ne fera que libérer les ténèbres pour qu'elles se réincarnent dans un autre corps.${prompt}
  12667: Pour briser ce cycle, les ténèbres elles-mêmes doivent être anéanties. ${prompt}
  12668: Elles doivent être effacées de l'endroit où toute vie prend naissance et où toute vie finit par revenir :le cristal-mère.${prompt}
  12669: Pour éradiquer totalement les ténèbres, le Gardien de l'Apocalypse doit être détruit non pas sous la forme d'un humain, mais sous la forme d'un dieu.${prompt}
  12670: C'est pourquoi j'ai conçu un plan pour utiliser la couche des Immortels afin de ressusciter Promathia.${prompt}
  12671: Résurrection...et destruction... ? ${prompt}
  12672: Mais ce plan a échoué.${prompt}
  12673: Lors de la cérémonie de baptême, j'ai...${prompt}
  12674: A cette époque, je me faisais tirer les vers du nez par le Vide en moi.${prompt}
  12675: J'ai vécu dans la cathédrale de Tavnazian depuis l'époque de mes premiers souvenirs, et j'ai cru que les portes du Paradis devaient être ouvertes.${prompt}
  12676: Mais par malchance, le vide en moi a réagi à la cuve baptismale et a été scellé dans cette magicite.${prompt}
  12677: |-
    Mon monde a basculé.
    Je fus soudain capable de lire dans les pensées des gens et, comme le cardinal Mildaurion, je n'ai plus jamais vieilli.${prompt}
  12678: |-
    Voilà ce qui s'est passé.
    Vous étiez le Gardien de l'Apocalypse... ${prompt}
  12679: |-
    Mais les choses sont différentes maintenant.
    Vous n'êtes plus le bon, n'est-ce pas ? ${prompt}
  12680: '...${prompt}'
  12681: Voulez-vous dire que rien n'a changé ? Que va-t-il arriver à Prishe ? ${prompt}
  12682: A en juger par les actions de Bahamut, le gardien est toujours parmi nous.${prompt}
  12683: Mais depuis vingt ans que je veille sur les terres de Vana'diel, je n'ai vu aucune autre incarnation possible...${prompt}
  12684: Bahamut souhaite me voir réduit en miettes sous la forme du Dieu du Crépuscule.${prompt}
  12685: C'est Diabolos qui m'a révélé ma destinée en tant que Gardien de l'Apocalypse.${prompt}
  12686: Mon destin est d'être détruit en même temps que cette magicite, et d'être écarté du cycle du cristal-mère.${prompt}
  12687: Non ! C'est trop horrible !${prompt}
  12688: |-
    Écoute-moi, Ulmia.
    Nous sommes allés assez loin dans cette quête.
    J'ai déjà entendu quatre des versets nécessaires pour ressusciter le Dieu du Crépuscule.${prompt}
  12689: Une fois le dernier verset obtenu, nous pourrons enfin nous présenter devant Bahamut...!${prompt}
  12690: |-
    S'il te plaît, Prishe!
    Entends-tu ce que tu dis!${prompt}
  12691: |-
    Comment puis-je te laisser offrir ton existence à Promathia ?
    Il doit y avoir un autre moyen...!${prompt}
  12692: |-
    Calme-toi, Ulmia.
    Prishe ne viendra pas avec nous. ${prompt}
  12693: Le dernier verset de la « Memoria de la S^tona » n'existe plus, et il ne reste plus aucune arme pour combattre le Dieu du Crépuscule.${prompt}
  12694: La force de Jeuno contre les wyrms est notre seul recours.${prompt}
  12695: Il n'y a pas d'autre moyen de sauver les enfants d'Altana de l'extinction.${prompt}
  12696: Mais Mlle Mildaurion ! Et moi ? ${prompt}
  12697: |-
    Dame Esha'ntarl!
    L'armada jeunoise est prête pour la bataille!${prompt}
  12698: |-
    Je dois partir.
    Au-delà de la mer de nuages sans fin.${prompt}
  12699: Cardinal Mildaurion!${prompt}
  12700: |-
    Prishe. Ulmia.
    Ce n'est qu'une question de temps avant que Jeuno ne devienne une zone de guerre.${prompt}
  12701: Je vais préparer un dirigeable pour votre retour en Tavnazia.${prompt}
  12702: Protégez ce qui vous est le plus cher.${prompt}
  12703: |-
    Bon sang !
    Il n'y a pas moyen que ça se termine comme ça !
    Il est temps de tout mettre en jeu!${prompt}
  12704: Prishe!?${prompt}
  12705: |-
    ${name-player}!
    Ulmia!${prompt}
  12706: Je sais que vous pouvez le faire!${prompt}
  12707: Vous êtes assez forts pour me battre quand je deviendrai Promathia...${prompt}
  12708: |-
    Ecoutez, il y a quelqu'un à Selbina qui connaît le cinquième verset.
    Sa mémoire est un peu défaillante... ${prompt}
  12709: Trouvez le cinquième vers!${prompt}
  12710: |-
    J'ai besoin que vous fassiez ça !
    Vous m'entendez ?
  12711: |-
    Je ne peux pas... !
    Prishe, attends!${prompt}
  12712: Ulmia, j'ai entendu toute l'histoire.${prompt}
  12713: Louverance!${prompt}

  13166: Sounds good! Leave it to me!${prompt}
  13167: Okay, I'll look forward to trying it.${prompt}
  13168: |-
    Okay!
    Sounds like fun!${prompt}
  13169: |-
    Really?
    Okay, I'll try it out.${prompt}
  13170: |-
    Hmmm. Okay!
    I'll do my best!${prompt}
  13171: |-
    Okay.
    I'll try that next time I fight.${prompt}
  13172: |-
    Fine.
    I will try your suggested combat style.${prompt}
  13173: |-
    What?
    You think I should change my headwear?${prompt}
  13174: |-
    My headwear?
    You think it's time for a change?${prompt}
  13175: You don't like my headwear?${prompt}
  13176: Are you suggesting a change in headwear?${prompt}
  13177: You want to choose new headwear for me?${prompt}
  13178: |-
    You're interested in my headwear?
    Sure, I don't mind you coordinating my fashion.${prompt}
  13179: |-
    What? Come on, out with it.
    You think I should change my headwear?${prompt}
  13180: |-
    Huh!?
    You don't like my headwear?
    Should I wear something else?${prompt}
  13181: |-
    Yes?
    You want me to change my headwear?${prompt}
  13182: |-
    What are you staring at?
    Don't you like my headwear?${prompt}
  13183: Are you suggesting a change in headwear?${prompt}
  13184: My headwear collection accounts for all possible battle conditions. Pick one that will meet your needs.${prompt}
  13185: Well, I guess I could wear something else.${prompt}
  13186: Hmm, I suppose a change couldn't hurt.${prompt}
  13187: I'll change it, then.${prompt}
  13188: Very well. I'll find something new.${prompt}
  13189: Thanks. I'll try this one.${prompt}
  13190: Ooh, I like your style!${prompt}
  13191: Okay, I'll change it for you.${prompt}
  13192: |-
    Well, okay.
    A change is as good as a holiday!${prompt}
  13193: I'll try something new, then.${prompt}
  13194: Hmm. I'll see what I can come up with!${prompt}
  13195: Very well. I'll find something new.${prompt}
  13196: Well, well, it seems you have an eye for these things. I shall equip this from now on.${prompt}
  13197: I'll forget you said anything, then.${prompt}
  13198: |-
    Oh?
    Okay.${prompt}
  13199: Well, that's a relief.${prompt}
  13200: I'll stay the way I am, then.${prompt}
  13201: |-
    So I don't need to change it?
    Fashion can be so frustrating...${prompt}
  13202: You like me just the way I am, eh?${prompt}
  13203: Well, that's good to hear.${prompt}
  13204: |-
    Are you sure?
    Well, I guess that's a good thing...${prompt}
  13205: |-
    Oh?
    Alright, then.${prompt}
  13206: |-
    Phew!
    I thought you thought I looked funny or something!${prompt}
  13207: I'll stay the way I am, then.${prompt}

    You are really trying my patience. Ask me again when I'm not so annoyed.${prompt}
  13233: |-
    With all its technology, the Duchy of Jeuno really is an advanced nation.
    I wonder how tall the cranes in Upper Jeuno are.${prompt}
  13234: |-
    Have you ever lit the lamps of Jeuno?
    I once helped illuminate the city all the way from the port to Ru'Lude Gardens!${prompt}
  13235: |-
    Did you know that there are two auction houses in Upper Jeuno?
    Remembering which one is less crowded is nice when you feel like avoiding the crush of people.${prompt}
  13236: |-
    You can find the most amazing things for sale in Ru'Lude Gardens.
    The Mithran flower shop girl definitely keeps her stock fresh!${prompt}
  13237: |-
    Wouldn't heavy rain flood out lower parts of Jeuno?
    An architectural defect like that shouldn't be left unchecked...${prompt}
  13238: |-
    Is that old man over there planning to sit down on that bench or what?
    And they complain about the younger generation being inconsiderate...${prompt}
  13239: |-
    Jeuno is definitely the place for clothes shopping.
    You can't beat Bastok for jewelry, though.${prompt}
  13240: Every time I come here I can't help but think that at least one person must've fallen off the edge...${prompt}
  13241: |-
    Jeuno would be the perfect place with a nice restaurant.
    Maybe I should go into the culinary business.${prompt}
  13242: |-
    I wonder what kind of meals the archduke eats?
    Do archdukes eat curry...?${prompt}

    My adventurer's instinct tells me that a secret weapon sleeps here in Jeuno.
    Most likely the part that would form the main body...${prompt}
  13245: |-
    Apparently, the construction of the cathedral took 120 years to complete.
    A structure like the Chateau d'Oraguille must take centuries.${prompt}
  13246: |-
    Chateau d'Oraguille is so huge, I had to start running around to see everything!
    Luckily a nice guard came and gave me a tour of the Bostaunieux Oubliette.${prompt}
  13247: |-
    If you stand by the fountain, some suspicious character will try to engage you in a game of dice.
    I think he has some kind of gambling problem...${prompt}
  13248: Were you aware that the “moat” in “moat carp” refers to the waters surrounding Chateau d'Oraguille?${prompt}
  13249: |-
    Children in this nation sure have it rough, having to work late into the night and all.
    At least military service isn't compulsory for them anymore.${prompt}
  13250: |-
    A while ago I was tasked with finding a bride for Prince Trion...but it didn't work out.
    I mean, where in Vana'diel am I supposed to find a “slender Tarutaru beauty”?${prompt}
  13251: |-
    The furniture stores in San d'Oria have the best selection of goods.
    No surprise with the Carpenters' Guild so close by.${prompt}
  13252: |-
    How embarrassing...
    I stumbled into the lumber stacked outside the Carpenters' Guild and knocked every single one down!${prompt}
  13253: |-
    Bean dishes are wholesome, healthy dishes.
    Blue peas are especially good when you're running low on gil.${prompt}
  13254: |-
    Port San d'Oria is built on a lake, right?
    What would happen if the waters rose too high...?${prompt}
  13255: Were you aware that the “moat” in “moat carp” refers to the waters surrounding Chateau d'Oraguille?${prompt}
  13256: |-
    That cathedral... It could easily transform into the head, and--
    A-ahem! Never mind...${prompt}
  13257: Does the water wheel on top of the Metalworks move the water, or does the water spin the wheel...?${prompt}
  13258: |-
    Don't you ever get tired of waiting for the elevator and just feel like jumping down instead?
    No...?${prompt}
  13259: |-
    I just saw a child walking by with an armful of subligaria.
    Bastok is a weird place...${prompt}
  13260: |-
    I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someone's younger brother.
    He didn't seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...${prompt}
  13261: |-
    How could anyone eat fish caught in Bastok's rivers?
    I wish there was a way to tell where fish up for auction are taken from.${prompt}
  13262: I never imagined getting my fashion sense criticized would be such a shattering blow to my self-confidence! Who was that girl anyway...${prompt}
  13263: I never get tired of browsing the jewelry and cosmetic stores in Bastok.${prompt}
  13264: I hope I'm as energetic as that chipper old guy in Bastok Markets when I get to his age...${prompt}
  13265: |-
    I've never eaten a treant bulb before.
    What do they taste like?${prompt}
  13266: |-
    Whose job is it to raise the bridge in Port Bastok?
    What if they fall asleep? Will the airship crash into the bridge?${prompt}
  13267: |-
    I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someone's younger brother.
    He didn't seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...${prompt}
  13268: The Metalworks is a truly magnificent structure, suitable of serving as the mighty arms that strike down the enemy...${prompt}
  13269: |-
    In Port Windurst, people have opened stores on top of boats in the harbor.
    I wonder if they ever change locations...${prompt}
  13270: |-
    I was walking around town when a huge nut fell out of a tree and bounced off my head.
    You should be careful!${prompt}
  13271: |-
    Windurst truly is a magical nation.
    I was just teleported from Windurst Woods to Windurst Waters in the blink of an eye.${prompt}
  13272: |-
    Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars.
    The property prices must be astronomical.${prompt}
  13273: |-
    Windurst is virtually governed by the Star Sibyl alone, right?
    Don't the ordinary citizens mind being sidelined from politics?${prompt}
  13274: Tarutaru residences are built to accommodate even the tallest Elvaans. But why build shelves so high up...?${prompt}
  13275: |-
    Windurst is famous for its hat shop.
    I can never visit the city without popping in at least once to check the latest styles.${prompt}
  13276: |-
    The hat shop in Windurst Waters has hoods with little ears attached on display.
    Are they not for sale?${prompt}
  13277: |-
    The restaurant food in Windurst is prepared by the Culinarians' Guild.
    I never miss a chance to indulge in one of their superb dishes.${prompt}
  13278: |-
    There seems to be a lot of water in Windurst.
    What happens if there's a rainstorm and everything floods?
    It wouldn't take much to submerge a wee Tarutaru...${prompt}
  13279: |-
    Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars.
    The property prices must be astronomical.${prompt}
  13280: A large building seems to have been embedded inside the Great Star Tree. I wouldn't be surprised if the leg portion of the secret weapon is concealed within.${prompt}
  13281: When I travel to hot areas, my feet always sweat inside my boots. Then the sand gets in there and it drives me crazy...${prompt}
  13282: |-
    I'm ashamed to admit it but...I'm hopeless at riding chocobos.
    I have my license, though. Really.${prompt}
  13283: |-
    Hmm.
    I can't think of anything to talk about.${prompt}
  13284: It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.${prompt}
  13285: Because the weather in town is usually either clear or cloudy, there's no need to carry a change of equipment. But since it can be quite unpredictable out in the wilderness, it's good to be prepared.${prompt}
  13286: Just between you and me, I obtained my armor here through unconventional methods.${prompt}
  13287: The other day I had to dash to an outpost to avoid being drenched in a sudden downpour.${prompt}
  13288: Do you ever get the urge to just run around like a mad thing when the ground is covered with snow?${prompt}
  13289: |-
    I do so much prefer to speak with you face to face.
    The pearl can be a little impersonal at times.${prompt}
  13290: |-
    Are moogles considered to be beastmen?
    Is there a moogle king? A god of the moogles?${prompt}
  13291: It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.${prompt}
  13292: The other week I went to the Tenshodo to collect a pair of gloves I had ordered, only to discover they were closed for business that day.${prompt}
  13293: |-
    I have to change my shoes as soon as I get home or I can't relax.
    Does anything like that ever happen to you?${prompt}
  13294: |-
    And have you ever worried that the chocobo smell stays with you, even after you dismount?
    Maybe I'm being paranoid...${prompt}
  13295: |-
    ...
    Nope, the only thing that comes to mind is the weather.
    Not very interesting at all.${prompt}
  13296: |-
    Do you notice the change?
    I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt}
  13297: There's nothing I hate more than getting caught outside without the right gear for the weather.${prompt}
  13298: |-
    The range of goods is pretty good if you buy through this method.
    Unfortunately though, some items aren't always in stock, so you don't always get what you want.${prompt}
  13299: |-
    The guards wouldn't let me inside, if you can believe it!
    My best dress, ruined!${prompt}
  13300: |-
    But if you run around too much, your shoes get all soggy.
    And nobody likes soggy shoes now, do they?${prompt}
  13301: I like to be able to see what you're thinking.${prompt}
  13302: I wonder what kind of pet a moogle god would keep...${prompt}
  13303: |-
    Do you notice the change?
    I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.${prompt}
  13304: Of course, that didn't deter me in the least. I simply seized some of the staff and “persuaded” them to open shop.${prompt}
  13305: No one ever seems to want to swing a huge sword while wearing a tunic or a robe...${prompt}
  13306: I'm hopeless at keeping my room tidy, so I bought some furniture to store all my items.${prompt}
  13307: I went to the Blacksmiths' Guild the other day to have some armor repaired, but it turned out to be their day off.${prompt}
  13308: Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?${prompt}
  13309: I've got my eye on some new equipment, but they're way too expensive.${prompt}
  13310: I appreciate your concern for my equipment and all, but what about your own attire?${prompt}
  13311: |-
    Have you ever seen an aurora?
    It looks like a rainbow-colored curtain draped across the sky.${prompt}
  13312: |-
    I never know what to wear on windy days.
    I mean, you can't wear a skirt, right?${prompt}
  13313: |-
    I've noticed that beastmen seem to carry gil around.
    What on Vana'diel do they use it for?${prompt}
  13314: |-
    The smilebringers really exist, you know!
    They live somewhere far to the north!${prompt}
  13315: Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?${prompt}
  13316: In the Near East, a race of rat-like beastmen called Qiqirn live alongside common folk. Their information network is said to be impressive.${prompt}
  13317: |-
    I always thought it would look mysterious and unique.
    Maybe I just have no fashion sense...${prompt}
  13318: |-
    For some reason, my Mog House began to feel damp after that.
    Guess I bought too many vases...${prompt}
  13319: |-
    Why does that always happen on the very day you decide to go?
    Call me impatient, but I ended up just buying a new set of armor...${prompt}
  13320: You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt}
  13321: But if I wait a little longer, maybe the price will come down. It's pretty normal for items to become cheaper after a while.${prompt}
  13322: Why, you ask? Is it a crime to want your partner to look cool?${prompt}
  13323: |-
    I've heard they can weave cloth that looks just like it.
    You must be able to make beautiful clothes out of that material...${prompt}
  13324: Not that I ever wear skirts, anyway...${prompt}
  13325: |-
    Do they trade with people?
    I wonder what a beastman would buy...${prompt}
  13326: |-
    They dress in red robes and a red hat, and dance around in white subligaria.
    You believe me, don't you, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13327: You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.${prompt}
  13328: |-
    But that reputation doesn't guarantee their information will always be accurate.
    After all, swindling isn't a race-exclusive occupation.${prompt}
  13329: |-
    You're probably thinking that I have a trunk full of armor.
    I actually trade my old gear in all the time.${prompt}
  13330: I've been meaning to tell you, but you shouldn't send me any deliveries.${prompt}
  13331: |-
    There are powerful enemies emerging all around us these days.
    We should keep up our training to avoid being overwhelmed in battle.${prompt}
  13332: |-
    It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls.
    No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.${prompt}
  13333: I've heard stories of people who can fight wyrms on even terms.${prompt}
  13334: You know, I'd love to visit your Mog House one day.${prompt}
  13335: You really feel like chatting today, I see.${prompt}
  13336: Do you eat out much?${prompt}
  13337: I've been trying different combinations of equipment, but I can't seem to make up my mind.${prompt}
  13338: |-
    What do you keep in your Mog House?
    Do you have furniture and stuff?${prompt}
  13339: |-
    It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls.
    No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.${prompt}
  13340: I usually spend my spare time on weapon maintenance and training. How do you spend yours?${prompt}
  13341: |-
    I have a friend in the business, you see.
    I'll introduce you sometime.${prompt}
  13342: The delivery people seem to have me mixed up with some other adventurer and I'm not getting my mail...${prompt}
  13343: |-
    Of course, I'll be there to fight beside you.
    Why don't we train together?${prompt}
  13344: I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.${prompt}
  13345: To become strong like that, how many hours a day do you think I should spend leveling?${prompt}
  13346: |-
    M...my Mog House, you ask? Out of the question!
    It's a total mess, with month-old half-eaten scraps...and much worse!${prompt}
  13347: Well, you could at least offer up a topic for conversation occasionally!${prompt}
  13348: |-
    Even though we get so much exercise, I start gaining weight if I eat too much good food.
    Must be a metabolism thing...${prompt}
  13349: |-
    I have as many as four different sets worked out...
    I suppose using them in combat will help me to decide.${prompt}
  13350: |-
    It's probably filled with flowerpots, right?
    Or maybe you have one of those mannequins!${prompt}
  13351: I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.${prompt}

  13705: Mankind will be annihilated. You have simply delayed the process.${prompt}
  13706: Do you dare to defy fate once again and fight to preserve your lives?${prompt}
  13707: |-
    Defy fate and fight?
    ${selection-lines}
    Fight and live!
    Fate is inevitable.${prompt}
  13708: 'Children of Vana''diel! ${choice: 0}[Stand in defiance/Accept your fate] and perish! Redeem the world as a part of the mothercrystals!'
  13709: You have delayed mankind's extinction yet again...${prompt}
  13710: An age is a mere flicker to a wyrm. However, enough flickers united form a star.${prompt}
  13711: |-
    Children of Vana'diel.
    Unite and form a future in which mankind can survive.
  13712: Let's go home for now, Prishe.${prompt}
  13713: Okay...${prompt}
  13714: ${name-player}, please tell Cardinal Mildaurion about this the next time you are in Jeuno.${prompt}
  13715: The “Star of Tavnazia”... The stone Prishe released when Promathia was defeated...${prompt}
  13716: The children of Vana'diel harbor the Emptiness inside their bodies, even if just a small amount. I envisioned it causing problems before too many thousands of years passed.${prompt}
  13717: However, I never dreamed that we would face such a threat so soon.${prompt}
  13718: We have no choice now but to stop Bahamut.${prompt}
  13719: I have a feeling that he was waiting for you, desiring a confrontation.${prompt}
  13720: Bahamut pays respect to the strong, regardless of stature. It is for that reason he is called the Wyrmking.${prompt}
  13721: |-
    You must gather an army of adventurers and challenge him yet again.
    Show our adversary the strength of mankind!${prompt}
  13722: As for me, I will conduct a thorough investigation of the emanations coming from the mothercrystals. Perhaps I will find something of interest.${prompt}
  13723: If you can unlock all the secrets of Vana'diel, we may meet again. I hope with every fabric of my being that that time will come.${prompt}
  13724: '${name-player} uses ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!${prompt}'
  13725: '${name-player} uses ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, but nothing happens.${prompt}'
  13726: We must make preparations and consult with Cardinal Mildaurion.${prompt}
  13727: |-
    ${name-player}, there is someone I would like you to meet.
    Please come this way...${prompt}
  13728: |-
    I have a fair idea of what's going on.
    It's surprising to find a Zilartian with a level head on her shoulders.${prompt}
  13729: 'There are four mothercrystal locations: the Crag of Holla, the Crag of Dem, the Crag of Mea, and the ruins of Pso''Xja.${prompt}'
  13730: Our investigation into the Emptiness surrounding these locations has produced some unusual readings.${prompt}
  13731: We put together a research team equipped with the latest weapons--weapons designed to combat the Emptiness--and sent them to Pso'Xja.${prompt}
  13732: And you wouldn't guess who they encountered...${prompt}
  13733: |-
    The ruins of Pso'Xja are under Tenshodo authority.
    Technically speaking, your researchers were trespassing.${prompt}
  13734: Verena had wandered down there like she was being guided by something.${prompt}
  13735: I found this at the place to where I was drawn.${prompt}
  13736: Apparently it belonged to a Galka known as Raogrimm--I'm sure you remember the name.${prompt}
  13737: |-
    Verena was once the receptacle for the memories of the Shadow Lord.
    This must be the reason behind her behavior.${prompt}
  13738: Similar readings have been recorded from the Emptiness found below the crags of Holla, Dem, and Mea.${prompt}
  13739: |-
    We have marked the points where the fluctuations were the strongest.
    I would like to entrust the investigation of these areas to you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13740: If my intuition on what lies out there is correct, you will make some fascinating discoveries indeed.${prompt}
  13741: |-
    You're a brave soul, ${name-player}.
    You'll never catch me in that awful place again.
    Once is more than enough...${prompt}
  13742: |-
    Please be careful.
    We'll be praying for your safe return.${prompt}
  13743: So these are what were causing such unusual activity within the Emptiness.${prompt}
  13744: I can feel the aura of those who returned to the mothercrystals...${prompt}
  13745: Nag'molada, Eald'narche, and even Archduke Kam'lanaut...${prompt}
  13746: Could it be possible that these entities are attempting to break back into this world?${prompt}
  13747: |-
    Will they return as they once were?
    Or as something more sinister?${prompt}
  13748: |-
    ${name-player}.
    We must put a stop to this.${prompt}
  13749: These reincarnations are beings that have chosen--and been chosen by--the Emptiness.${prompt}
  13750: |-
    Go. Prepare yourself for battle, then return to me here.
    Let us raise the curtain on the final conflict.${prompt}
  13751: I fear their powers will be beyond any race that has walked Vana'diel.${prompt}
  13752: You hand the three crystal slivers to Esha'ntarl.${prompt}
  13753: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Let us discuss what needs to be done.${prompt}
  13754: I have returned from an audience with the Wyrmking.${prompt}
  13755: If the Keeper of the Apocalypse is indeed attempting to cross over into this world, there is but one option left to us.${prompt}
  13756: |-
    We force the keeper to appear on our terms.
    Then we crush him.${prompt}
  13757: This was Prishe's original plan.${prompt}
  13758: Ulmia will sing the Lay of the Immortals in the presence of the fifth mothercrystal.${prompt}
  13759: |-
    The time has finally come to use the completed song--the verses you discovered on your journey.
    I have faith that Ulmia can perform the piece with little trouble.${prompt}
  13760: |-
    Make your way to the Sealion's Den in Tavnazia.
    Al'Taieu beckons once again.${prompt}
  13761: ${name-player}, I have awaited your arrival.${prompt}
  13762: It is my fault that this terrible thing is occurring--I have no excuses.${prompt}
  13763: I always feared that my act of relinquishing the Star of Tavnazia...${prompt}
  13764: '...would one day bring the world back to the brink of destruction.${prompt}'
  13765: |-
    But to be completely honest, I am overjoyed that this darkness has given us another chance to meet.
    Truly, I am...${prompt}
  13766: |-
    Prishe!
    You stop this nonsense at once!${prompt}
  13767: |-
    Why must you insist on playing the clown at a time like this!?
    You truly are incorrigible!${prompt}
  13768: |-
    Aw, c'mon, Ulmia!
    It's been so long since I've seen ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13769: A normal reunion would be kinda boring, and I just wanted to spice things up a little...${prompt}
  13770: You were just trying to cover up your own awkwardness!${prompt}

    Cardinal Mildaurion will be joining us later.
    Let us begin our journey to the fifth mothercrystal.${prompt}
  13774: |-
    Our mission will be a success.
    I know it in my heart.${prompt}
  13775: Prishe, Ulmia, ${name-player}!
  13776: |-
    You seem surprised.
    Well, our last parting of ways did seem somewhat final.${prompt}
  13777: But you couldn't expect us to stay at home shivering in our fur when word of this rrreached us!${prompt}
  13778: |-
    As the...Moblins say...
    “Don't leave...a hole...half...dug...”${prompt}
  13779: Are we digging holes?
  13780: For the graves?${prompt}
  13781: Not very optimistic, are we!${prompt}
  13782: |-
    I never thought I would don this armor again.
    Cardinal Mildaurion is not one to be ignored.${prompt}
  13783: |-
    Wow, the whole gang's here.
    All because of my selfish mistake...${prompt}
  13784: |-
    My apologies...${wait-36: 1}
    And my thanks!${wait-animation: 4}
  13785: |-
    The time has come.
    On to the mothercrystal!${prompt}
  13786: |-
    Hehehe.
    I always wanted to come back to this place.
    Y'know, for a picnic or something.${prompt}
  13787: Still making unrealistic wishes, Prishe?
  13788: |-
    Miss Mildaurion!
    Aldo!?
  13789: |-
    I'm sure you all know Zeid.
    We have a debt to the ancients that needs to be repaid.${prompt}
  13790: |-
    I will also fight alongside you.
    I must see this matter put to rest.${prompt}
  13791: Here they come!
  13792: Bound together...
  13793: By the crystals...
  13794: We will soon...
  13795: Become one...
  13796: There's something else...!
  13797: A fifth person!?${prompt}
  13798: Lion!?
  13799: Hahaha!
  13800: The stone she would not relinquish...!
  13801: It has been shattered by your song...!
  13802: Our divine transformation is at hand!
  13803: This ends now!
  13804: Leave Nag'molada to me!
  13805: You shall be the first...!${prompt}
  13806: The first to taste the vengeance of the dead!${prompt}
  13807: I think we're done here.${prompt}
  13808: |-
    Yes, the battle is over.
    There is only...${prompt}
  13809: |-
    She appears to be unharmed.
    There is some trace of Emptiness, but it will cause nothing more than a few bad dreams.${prompt}
  13810: |-
    Thank Altana...
    It was Lion who leaped into the crystal to save us all.${prompt}
  13811: Her struggle with Eald'narche continued within the stone...${prompt}
  13812: Let's get her home to Norg...${prompt}
  13813: |-
    Your red hair...
    Now I know you.${prompt}
  13814: |-
    The nightmare I had...
    You were the one who carried it on for me.${prompt}
  13815: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Make sure you fulfill your promise when she gets better, okay?${prompt}
  13816: The world only grows larger the longer we live. New lives are born, and new lands are discovered. There're always new adventures to be had.${prompt}
  13817: |-
    But you don't gotta rush in, you know?
    This big world of ours will always be waiting.${prompt}
  13818: Waiting for you.${prompt}
  13819: '${color-alt: 15}${name-player}''s badge flashes brightly.${prompt}'
  13820: The Near East must be in a dire condition to send mercenary recruiters all the way to Jeuno...${prompt}
  13821: I heard many tales of the Great War from my dear departed father. They all seemed irrelevant to me until now...${prompt}
  13822: |-
    I see you've got a Salaheem's Sentinel badge there...
    They must be desperate to use those as an attention-grabbing device.${prompt}
  13823: Maybe the empress of Aht Urhgan is short on devoted subjects...${prompt}
  13824: Hm? I see you have one of those brass badges that Salaheem's Sentinels are handing out unauthorized. Let me take a look at it.${prompt}
  13825: |-
    Interesting. Objects from the Near East seem to shine with a different light.
    I've heard that the president of Salaheem's Sentinels is quite tight-fisted, but at least this badge is quite luxurious.${prompt}
  13826: |-
    Near Eastern cuisine is all the rage now.
    Lately I've been studying up on it to add some spice to the palace banquets.${prompt}
  13827: Near Eastern cooking is considered one of the leading cuisines in Vana'diel, so I am sure the archduke will be most pleased.${prompt}
  13828: Lately, the Empire of Aht Urhgan has been building up her army. That's sure to make waves internationally...${prompt}
  13829: Do you think we can continue to preserve friendly relations with all three major nations as the balance of power hangs by a thread?${prompt}
  13830: |-
    You have gathered here today at the request of the Kingdom of San d'Oria.
    I thank you on behalf of the king.${prompt}
  13831: |-
    This is the first time in history that an emergency summit of this nature has taken place.
    The issue I lay before you is beyond the scope of a single nation...${prompt}
  13832: |-
    Prince Pieuje!
    The adventurer you have permitted to attend the summit has arrived.${prompt}
  13833: Thank you for coming, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13834: Allow me to begin by explaining the events that have led to today's meeting.${prompt}
  13835: It began when ${name-player}, mercenary and adventurer, arrived at the gate of the Chateau d'Oraguille bearing a letter of extreme importance.${prompt}
  13836: The contents of that letter prompted me to call the nations together...${prompt}
  13837: It was penned by a sage known as Raillefal, and described in painstaking detail the current state of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  13838: This is the same nation that has the port in a frenzy over mercenary recruitment...?${prompt}
  13839: |-
    The very same.
    I speak of the Near Eastern nation, the Empire of Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  13840: The Empire!?${prompt}
  13841: Aht Urhgan is now under pressure from three separate beastman armies, and Al Zahbi, the mighty capital itself, is in danger of falling.${prompt}
  13842: Great Altana...${prompt}
  13843: The Silent Empire...${prompt}
  13844: It was once called that.${prompt}
  13845: You may have been too young to know this, Your Highness, but the rest of us should remember.${prompt}
  13846: '...${prompt}'
  13847: I am aware of the term.${prompt}
  13848: In the time of the Great War, the Empire possessed an army greater than the combined forces of the allied nations.${prompt}
  13849: Yet not a single soldier was sent in response to calls for aid...${prompt}
  13850: |-
    My apologies.
    You are well versed in history.${prompt}
  13851: But knowing this, you should also know that we have no obligation to lift even a finger for Aht Urhgan, no matter how serious her predicament.${prompt}
  13852: |-
    Why, Volker, always so calm and cool.
    You've grown hot and bothered, and your speech is most cruel.${prompt}
  13853: You should understand, Doctor Shantotto.${prompt}
  13854: |-
    You were there on that battlefield.
    Who knows how much suffering could've been avoided if we'd had the help of the Empire...${prompt}
  13855: |-
    On the contrary, my dear musketeer.
    We owe them more than you can imagine, I fear.${prompt}
  13856: What do you mean!?${prompt}
  13857: Aht Urhgan has taken many countries under her yoke...${prompt}
  13858: A ferocious nation that has even bared fangs at the Far Eastern folk.${prompt}
  13859: |-
    Calling the Empire to help in our cause,
    would be like freeing us from demons in return for dragon jaws.${prompt}
  13860: That may be true, but even the close relationship Aht Urhgan had with Tavnazia...${prompt}
  13861: That subject is not--${prompt}
  13862: |-
    ...the issue here, I know.
    Doctor Shantotto, why did Windurst open Mhaura's port to the Empire?${prompt}
  13863: My nation's actions are none of your concern.${prompt}
  13864: At least we have a backbone--when will Bastok learn...?${prompt}
  13865: You go too far, Doctor Shantotto...${prompt}
  13866: |-
    Enough!
    I did not call you here to speak of possible troop contributions.${prompt}
  13867: Then why are we here, Your Highness?${prompt}
  13868: Our main concern is the treasure thought to be at the center of this conflict--the Astral Candescence.${prompt}
  13869: “Astral Candescence”?${prompt}
  13870: It is described as some manner of musical instrument, but apparently is much more than that.${prompt}
  13871: This instrument is said to produce a phenomenon known as the “Astral Wind,” a breeze that blows from an unidentifiable source.${prompt}
  13872: It creates a melody in a timbre unheard by mortal ears...${prompt}
  13873: |-
    I'm confused.
    How can there be a melody if nothing can be heard...?${prompt}
  13874: Astral Wind...${prompt}
  13875: Hmph. This is all very unusual, but I'm sure we've all seen stranger things before.${prompt}
  13876: An unidentifiable source...${prompt}
  13877: |-
    In Windurst there is no shortage of magical gadgets.
    Pens that write by themselves. Brooms that sweep on command...${prompt}
  13878: A breeze...${prompt}
  13879: |-
    I mean, they even have that Cardian band.
    That's similar, don't you think, Doctor Shantotto?${prompt}
  13880: Astral...${prompt}
  13881: Wind...${prompt}
  13882: |-
    Doctor Shantotto?
    Is everything alright?${prompt}
  13883: '!!!${prompt}'
  13884: Ohohohoho!${prompt}
  13885: |-
    If it's automatic instruments you need,
    our children make such things before they learn how to read!${prompt}
  13886: The problem lies in the power of the wind.${prompt}
  13887: The wind?${prompt}
  13888: |-
    It envelops those close by, and fills them with a mysterious strength.
    There are few who can resist the lure of this energy.${prompt}
  13889: Even among the beastmen...${prompt}
  13890: If the instrument is that dangerous, why not just give it to the beastmen, or smash it out of hand?${prompt}
  13891: |-
    That is what common sense would tell us.
    If it were up to an individual, or even an entire town...${prompt}
  13892: What are you trying to say?${prompt}
  13893: What if that decision lay in the hands of a nation?${prompt}
  13894: Even if it posed a threat to your own citizens, if that treasure could one day be your salvation, would you not choose to protect it?${prompt}
  13895: How could a mere instrument hold that kind of power...?${prompt}
  13896: The sage who composed this letter is afraid...${prompt}
  13897: Afraid that this Astral Candescence will one day be the catalyst for a conflict to rival the Crystal War.${prompt}
  13898: No!${prompt}
  13899: |-
    Prince Pieuje...
    As a representative for an entire nation, you would do well not to throw those words around so lightly!${prompt}
  13900: |-
    My apologies.
    This is merely based on the conjecture of a sage.${prompt}
  13901: Why don't we have ${name-player}, who has seen and heard these things in person, give us ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] account?${prompt}
  13902: '...${prompt}'
  13903: We cannot make a decision based on this tale alone.${prompt}
  13904: A nation has a responsibility to maintain soldiers and weaponry for the defense of its people.${prompt}
  13905: And for a city in this situation, I would go so far as to say that some sort of secret weapon is almost a necessity.${prompt}
  13906: In any case, it doesn't seem that this Astral Candescence presents any immediate danger to the people of Al Zahbi.${prompt}
  13907: |-
    I wouldn't say that was entirely true,
    if you were me, and I were you.${prompt}
  13908: |-
    ${name-player}.
    I came to a conclusion after you left the chateau.${prompt}
  13909: I wish to hear your honest opinion.${prompt}
  13910: |-
    Give Pieuje your honest opinion?
    ${selection-lines}
    Yes.
    No.${prompt}
  13911: |-
    Excellent. I knew asking you here was the right decision.
    I rely upon your vast experience as an adventurer.${prompt}
  13912: Ahaha. Only an adventurer would choose to jest in such company as this.${prompt}
  13913: What is the Astral Candescence?${prompt}
  13914: If it is such an important treasure, then why not secret it away inside the palace instead of placing it in the area most vulnerable to beastman attacks?${prompt}
  13915: I sense some hidden purpose for this dangerous object...${prompt}
  13916: Do you have any thoughts on the matter, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  13917: |-
    Any thoughts?
    ${selection-lines}
    Sage Walahra...
    The Gordeus...
    The Walahra Philosophy...
    Not really...${prompt}
  13918: |-
    ${name-player}.
    If you have nothing to contribute, then there is little point in you being here...${prompt}
  13919: |-
    Sage Walahra?
    What manner of person is this?${prompt}
  13920: '...I see.${prompt}'
  13921: The father of the Walahra Philosophy and an alchemist of great renown...${prompt}
  13922: “I, alone, do not possess all the answers. Let us ponder the mysteries of the universe together.”${prompt}
  13923: “Shared knowledge is the shortest path to enlightenment...”${prompt}
  13924: |-
    Hmm.
    Not a philosophy that would appeal to my brother...${prompt}
  13925: Is Prince Trion somehow involved...?${prompt}
  13926: Ah, forgive me. I was merely thinking aloud...${prompt}
  13927: |-
    The “Gordeus.”
    I have heard this name somewhere before...${prompt}
  13928: What manner of person is this?${prompt}
  13929: Not a person? So, it is a holy relic enshrined in Walahra Temple...${prompt}
  13930: In the distant past, Sage Walahra once unraveled the Gordeus and grasped the fundamental principle of existence...${prompt}
  13931: And now a host of like-minded scholars toil day and night to discover the same loose thread to unravel the Gordeus for themselves.${prompt}
  13932: It appears the people of the Empire search for quite different truths than the ones we seek...${prompt}
  13933: |-
    The Walahra Philosophy?
    What manner of learning is this?${prompt}
  13934: What connection does this philosophy have to the Astral Candescence?${prompt}
  13935: “From the void all things are born. To the void all things return.”${prompt}
  13936: I do not understand what this “void” they speak of refers to.${prompt}
  13937: Though this philosophy is not so far from our own belief that all life begins and ends with Great Altana and the mothercrystals...${prompt}
  13938: |-
    Ohohoho!
    Too much time in the cathedral for Destin's little boy!
    The mind is a tool you must sharpen, not a child's toy!${prompt}
  13939: Do you mock me, Doctor Shantotto!?${prompt}
  13940: |-
    You look for your answers in all the wrong places.
    Shall I bring a little hope to your long, dreary faces?${prompt}
  13941: What are you hiding, Shantotto?${prompt}
  13942: The servants of Walahra control the Hall of Binding--the treasure's little nest.${prompt}
  13943: The Hall of Binding is defended by the Serpent Generals--the best of the best!${prompt}
  13944: |-
    The Serpent Generals?
    A name I have heard. Each one is said to be worth a thousand soldiers.${prompt}
  13945: The Astral Candescence is strictly monitored by the Walahra Temple, according to the adventurer's speech...${prompt}
  13946: But the treasure is kept in an area that the beastmen can easily reach.${prompt}

  13948: Plus mercenaries like ${name-player} to help them, if I'm not wrong?${prompt}
  13949: Yes, there does seem to be some contradiction to be found here.${prompt}
  13950: You see...${prompt}
  13951: |-
    This is a huge game of “set the trap and wait.”
    And the Astral Candescence is the very tasty bait!${prompt}

  13953: |-
    Of course!
    Why didn't I see it?${prompt}
  13954: |-
    But wait.
    This creates a whole new set of questions.
    Why would they want the beastmen in the city?${prompt}
  13955: |-
    There are some things that even I cannot divine.
    It's time to sit back and wait for a sign.${prompt}
  13956: But it does seem that this problem lies at the center of some grand plan.${prompt}
  13957: Without concern for the people of Al Zahbi...${prompt}
  13958: We need more information.${prompt}
  13959: |-
    Yes.
    An individual of keen wits and sharp senses...${prompt}
  13960: My lords, I have a suggestion.${prompt}
  13961: ${name-player} is employed as a mercenary in the Empire.${prompt}
  13962: 'However, ${choice: 0}[she/he] is a distinguished adventurer, who will not sell ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] principles for a bag of gil.${prompt}'
  13963: I point to the safe delivery of the sage's letter as proof of ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] dedication.${prompt}
  13964: A long journey without promise of reward.${prompt}
  13965: And I am sure that all of you present have had numerous beneficial dealings with adventurers.${prompt}
  13966: They have earned our trust and respect!${prompt}
  13967: That is why I put forth the motion that we have ${name-player} return to the Empire and fight as a mercenary.${prompt}
  13968: We cannot allow any more blood to be spilled by beastmen, even should that blood belong to another nation's people.${prompt}
  13969: And if ${name-player} can improve ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] standing enough to bring ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] closer to the Imperial palace...${prompt}
  13970: We may learn the ultimate goal of the Empire.${prompt}
  13971: |-
    You'll find no argument here.
    Adventurers have been the quiet heroes in many of Bastok's darker moments.${prompt}
  13972: |-
    An idea that creates less work for us,
    will not find me making a needless fuss!${prompt}
  13973: How does the Duchy of Jeuno stand on this?${prompt}
  13974: In agreement.${prompt}
  13975: The linking of our auction house services has strengthened the ties between Jeuno and the Empire, but economical matters are superseded by politics...${prompt}
  13976: All in favor...?${prompt}
  13977: |-
    One moment.
    As Raillefal warned, this problem is not likely to remain constrained within the borders of the Near East.${prompt}
  13978: All the lands of Vana'diel, including our four nations...${prompt}
  13979: “Urhguum” is the word for “world” in the language of Aht Urhgan, and this lurking threat could plunge it entirely into chaos.${prompt}
  13980: |-
    We lay this mission before you, ${name-player}.
    Will you consent to take up this burden?${prompt}
  13981: |-
    Take up the burden?
    ${selection-lines}
    That's what I'm here for!
    What am I, a donkey?${prompt}
  13982: You have our thanks, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  13983: Naturally, we will do all in our power to aid you in this task.${prompt}
  13984: It is a trifling amount, but perhaps you might use this Aht Urhgan coin on your travels.${prompt}
  13985: An adventurer is free to choose ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] own path...${prompt}
  13986: |-
    However, what I ask of you is for the sake of all Vana'diel.
    I am sure that when the time comes, I can rely on you to perform your duty.${prompt}
  13987: That treasure is more than simple bait...${prompt}
  13988: An astral relic can and will seal your fate.${prompt}
  13989: |-
    The Empress goes too far in her game.

  14031: But before you go in, why don't you take a few moments to gather your thoughts?${prompt}

  14033: '　　 ${wait-animation: 1}'
  14034: As I've already stated numerous times, it is in our best interests to prevent the completion of the Empire's secret weapon, this “iron colossus” of theirs.${prompt}
  14035: Bastok is prepared to employ military action to accomplish this goal--without your support, if necessary.${prompt}
  14036: |-
    I am in full agreement with the captain in this case.
    The Empire's intentions are clear--we must not lose this race.${prompt}
  14037: But if we mobilize our forces, we will be giving the Grand Vizier and his supporters just the ammunition they need to fuel a full-scale war.${prompt}
  14038: The Empress yet retains loyal subjects within Her realm. I believe we can still avoid open confrontation.${prompt}
  14039: |-
    Ohohoho...so unlike you, my dear prince.
    Your sentimental view of the situation is making me wince.${prompt}
  14040: If I'm not mistaken, Your Highness, wasn't it one of your agents that described the Empress's position as little more than a puppet on the throne?${prompt}
  14041: I...${prompt}
  14042: This will be a conflict of epic proportions. Perhaps we should strive harder for a diplomatic solution...${prompt}
  14043: While I agree with you in theory, we walk a dangerous line.${prompt}
  14044: Despite its state of constant warfare, the sprawling Empire commands staggering resources. If we fail to make the first move, we could face casualties on the scale of the Great War.${prompt}
  14045: |-
    The Great War? Surely you jest?
    The carnage from this apocalypse will be far greater than all the rest.${prompt}
  14046: Worse than the Great War?${prompt}
  14047: |-
    You all know of the Gordeus, I presume?
    It is best we're all aware of this potential source of doom.${prompt}
  14048: One does not lightly forget such an object...${prompt}
  14049: You speak of the sacred artifact kept within the Walahra Temple?${prompt}
  14050: An amazing creation worthy of mention.${prompt}
  14051: But that is not the phenomenon to which I wish to draw your attention.${prompt}
  14052: I refer to an event from nine hundred years before...${prompt}
  14053: The supernova that was born from the earth and stole the night sky for an entire year, as was passed down in lore.${prompt}
  14054: |-
    Ah, now this I recall from my lessons!
    This was the miracle bestowed by the Goddess that marked the beginning of the Crystal Era.${prompt}
  14055: After the glare finally faded, this star of the first magnitude became part of the Alexander constellation, correct?${prompt}
  14056: |-
    It was merely a coincidence that the supernova's trajectory passed in front of that star.
    The truth of the matter is more fascinating by far.${prompt}
  14057: The trajectory? I don't understand.${prompt}
  14058: I discovered an ancient papyrus in the extensive vaults of the Optistery.${prompt}
  14059: The following was written in a script bold and flowery:${prompt}
  14060: “When the light deity clashed with the dark, rent in twain were the heavens, and devastated was the earth by a storm beyond comprehension.”${prompt}
  14061: |-
    I must admit to feeling a degree of shock,
    for this simple passage described the arrival of Ragnarok...${prompt}
  14062: |-
    Ragnarok...
    The northern legend that tells of the twilight of the gods?
    You mean to tell us that this supernova was in fact the aftermath of a battle between divinities?${prompt}
  14063: |-
    Oh, so close to the mark.
    Shall I endeavor to bring you out of the dark?${prompt}
  14064: This is my hypothesis based on the facts at hand...${prompt}
  14065: The old Empire of Aht Urhgan launched their iron colossus, imbued with the spirit of the light deity, high into the air, and attempted to dominate the entire land.${prompt}
  14066: |-
    The nation that revered a rival deity was unsurprisingly not amused.
    They sent up their Dark Rider born from sacrifice and with utter darkness infused.${prompt}
  14067: A fierce battle raged in the skies, and eventually both combatants fell to earth--the giant in pieces, and the rider with grave wounds to his material form.${prompt}
  14068: But this titanic struggle had blasted the land into ruin, and left a void in the heavens that spawned a cataclysmic storm...${prompt}
  14069: An apocalypse...${prompt}
  14070: |-
    What a ridiculous story.
    How could an iron colossus be made to fly?${prompt}
  14071: And what does this have to do with the name of the Gordeus?${prompt}
  14072: |-
    We Tarutaru have always been notoriously fussy about our cuisine.
    The name was probably heard from a trader in foreign goods, is what I mean.${prompt}
  14073: The name of the colossus's heart, given to a star...${prompt}
  14074: We have let ourselves be distracted by the candescences. The Gordeus should have been our true concern.${prompt}
  14075: |-
    We can only hope that the Grand Vizier has failed to notice the true value of the treasure under his nose.
    We must hurry to bring this matter to a close.${prompt}
  14076: |-
    Naji reporting in!
    I've brought ${name-player} back with me!${prompt}
  14077: You're late. Where in Altana's name have you been!?${prompt}
  14078: Take it easy, Ayame.${prompt}
  14079: |-
    ${name-player}, we are grateful you could come.
    Your insight will be invaluable.${prompt}
  14080: Please, describe to us your impressions of the events unfolding in the Empire...${prompt}
  14081: Thanks to your talents, gaining the program data we needed was far less complicated than expected.${prompt}
  14082: But the Empress appears to have only a tentative hold on consciousness...${prompt}
  14083: It is nothing to be concerned about. When reading someone's memories with my altered...perspective...it occasionally releases images and thoughts sealed deep within the mind.${prompt}
  14084: |-
    This state of regression is only temporary.
    She will recover in time...${prompt}
  14085: Let us begin.${prompt}
  14086: So...this day has finally come.${prompt}
  14087: That voice!${prompt}
  14088: If it isn't Nashmeira, then who...?${prompt}
  14089: I know not who you are, but it appears you have completed construction of Alzadaal and unraveled the Gordeus.${prompt}
  14090: |-
    Congratulations are in order!
    You will soon hold the most awe-inspiring weapon in Urhguum in the palm of your hand--the power of light.${prompt}
  14091: Father...!?${prompt}
  14092: But the power of Alexander is a double-edged sword.${prompt}
  14093: Mother!${prompt}
  14094: |-
    The infinite energy of a star...
    The legends--not to mention the ruins--speak eloquently of the destruction that will befall should you make a single misstep.${prompt}
  14095: |-
    It is not too late.
    If you possess a shred of compassion, you will halt the program immediately.
    We hope you choose the wiser course...${prompt}
  14096: |-
    Hmph...a cunning trick, Nashmeira.
    Defiant until the last.${prompt}
  14097: '...${prompt}'
  14098: '!!!'
  14099: |-
    Behold!
    This is the will of Alexander!${prompt}

  14107: |-
    Thank you, ${name-player}.
    I am sure we all felt the immediacy of your experiences.${prompt}
  14108: And if we can believe the words of the Grand Vizier, a war with the Empire seems inevitable.${prompt}
  14109: I'm afraid I have to agree with you...${prompt}
  14110: |-
    Then, a war it shall be.
    Preparations must be made with all urgency.${prompt}
  14111: |-
    Bastok's armada is ready to sail.
    Once I give the order, the seas will be ours.${prompt}
  14112: Are we committed?${prompt}
  14113: |-
    Ohohoho.
    Our amphibious cardian advance units were already given the order to deploy.
    They lay hidden in the Wajaom Woodlands, primed and waiting to destroy.${prompt}
  14114: |-
    Already deployed...?
    Was the decision of this council a forgone conclusion?${prompt}
  14115: '...${prompt}'
  14116: N-now hold on a minute!${prompt}
  14117: '!!!${prompt}'
  14118: From what I could gather from ${name-player}'s explanation, this Luzaf character wants to prevent Ragnarok as much as we do.${prompt}
  14119: Naji! Remember your station!${prompt}
  14120: And the Empress is of the same mind...isn't that right, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  14121: The way I see it, there's no need to go head-to-head with the Empire's forces.${prompt}
  14122: If we can spirit Luzaf out of their clutches, then we can at least put a stop to this Ragnarok business.${prompt}
  14123: We might even get a chance to restore authority to the Empress while we're at it.${prompt}
  14124: Ayame, ${name-player}...we've all been to Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
  14125: We've seen the lives, the smiles, the tears of her people...${prompt}
  14126: |-
    The citizens of the Empire are as much the children of Altana as we are.
    War should be considered only after every other avenue has been exhausted.${prompt}
  14127: Naji...${prompt}
  14128: |-
    Ohohohohoho.
    A voice of reason from Bastok, the nation of mines and gloom?${prompt}
  14129: And you would plan this strategy yourself, I assume?${prompt}
  14130: |-
    What? Um, y-yes!
    Of course!${prompt}
  14131: |-
    Wonderful. I admire your ambition.
    I shall offer the latest model of cardian to escort you on this mission.${prompt}
  14132: Thank you, Doctor Shantotto!${prompt}
  14133: |-
    Very well.
    Then you shall have two veteran knights to accompany you as well.${prompt}
  14134: And from Jeuno, you will have the use of our fastest airship, with an ace pilot at the wheel.${prompt}
  14135: Prince Trion, Sir Wolfgang...${prompt}
  14136: |-
    It appears I have no choice.
    I will inform the president of this operation myself.${prompt}
  14137: Captain Volker! Then I should--${prompt}
  14138: On one condition!${prompt}
  14139: |-
    ${name-player} is to go with you.
    Will you accompany Naji?${prompt}

    Join the mission to rescue Luzaf?
    ${selection-lines}
    Count me in!
    I just left the Empire...${prompt}
  14141: It will be dangerous, but please lend Naji your experience and expertise.${prompt}
  14142: It will be dangerous, but I will feel better knowing Naji is accompanied by someone I know I can trust.${prompt}
  14143: Looking forward to working with you, ${name-player}!${prompt}
  14144: Excellent. I will have Pherimociel prepare your transportation at once.${prompt}
  14145: |-
    I understand.
    Not many would be willing to throw themselves back into the dragon's lair so soon after escaping it.${prompt}
  14146: |-
    I see...
    I understand it will be dangerous, but I believe you would be up to the task, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  14147: Well, then, I guess I'll have to make do without ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]...${prompt}
  14148: |-
    No, Naji.
    Without ${name-player}, I will not allow this reckless plan to go ahead.${prompt}
  14149: In any case, Captain Volker, I will have Pherimociel prepare an airship for departure.${prompt}
  14150: |-
    ${name-player}.
    Speak to Pherimociel should you change your mind.
    You can find him in the Ducal Guard Post.${prompt}
  14151: |-

    Voilà ! J'ai préparé un sort qui transportera instantanément toutes les tablettes que vous trouverez jusqu'à moi.
    Revenez si vous trouvez quelque chose, et bonne exploration, kupo!${prompt}
  14313: |-
    Assieds-toi bien et je vais te raconter l'histoire, kupo.
    Il y a bien longtemps, nous, les moogles, avions notre propre royaume glorieux.
    C'était l'apogée de la civilisation moogle, un véritable âge d'or pour toute l'humanité moogle!${prompt}
  14314: Le septième roi de cette grande nation était le sage et bienveillant roi Kupofried, un magistral magicien célèbre pour être le père de la fantastique magie moogle qui survit encore aujourd'hui, kupo !${prompt}
  14315: |-
    À la fin de sa vie, le roi Kupofried entreprit ce qui allait devenir la plus grande œuvre de son illustre règne.
    Soucieux de transmettre la prospérité de son royaume aux générations futures, il inscrivit onze incantations à la joie et au bonheur des moogle sur onze tablettes de pierre.${prompt}
  14316: Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...${prompt}
  14317: |-
    King Kupofried was greatly dismayed.
    How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?${prompt}
  14318: In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.${prompt}
  14319: “Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo,” he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.${prompt}
  14320: |-
    Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin.
    A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?${prompt}
  14321: |-
    We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition.
    We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!${prompt}
  14322: |-
    Let's see...
    It appears that ${number: 0} moogle ${choice-plurality: 0}[tablet has/tablets have] already been found, kupo.${prompt}

    Oh, glorious day!
    All eleven mog tablets have been recovered and restored to their rightful place at the altar of King Kupofried!${prompt}

    Can you feel the ancient moogle magic in the air?
    You can now bask in the benefits of this Super Kupower...${prompt}

    “Blood of the Vampyr”!
    Signets have been boosted with the abilities of Regeneration and Refresh!${prompt}

    “Treasure Hound”!
    With Signet in effect, you will now be able to sniff out more treasure and gil! Great riches surely await you, kupo!${prompt}
  14334: |-
    “Artisan's Advantage”!
    Good news for aspiring artisans, kupo! When receiving advanced image support, the chance of your ingredients being lost in a failed synthesis attempt has been drastically reduced!${prompt}
  14335: |-
    “Myriad Mystery Boxes”!
    What's this, kupo? Mysterious boxes have been sighted all over the realm!
    What genius could have devised such commendable creations?${prompt}
  14336: |-
    “Dilatory Digestion”!
    Not content to be left behind, brown magic slides back out for another go, kupo!
    Now you can be what you eat for twice as long and save on all those trips to your local merchant.${prompt}

    Trust in Signet and you can never go wrong, kupo!
    It's time to take to the field and vanquish a veritable army of enemies, for any Conquest Points you receive will be duly doubled!${prompt}

    “Bountiful Bazaar”!
    Trade routes are bustling with unprecedented traffic and peddlers' carts are overflowing with objects now that regional goods are available to merchants across the realm, kupo!${prompt}

    This is just the ticket for today's busy adventurer! For a limited time, provided that you're fully rested and healed, your legs will carry you with the speed of a chocobo!${prompt}

    “Crystal Caboodle”!
    Signet is now better than ever! Collect crystals from beastmen-controlled areas...and maybe even clusters from other areas!${prompt}

    What? What about the past, you say?
    Of course the magic won't travel through time.
    What a strange question, kupo...${prompt}
  14344: But not an altogether pointless, one. The powers of thirtfy transit do seem to apply across the space-time continuum, kupo.${prompt}

    Oh, it's you! It's really you!

    ${name-player}.
    What brings you to the Duchy wearing such a grave expression?${prompt}
  14378: '...I see.${prompt}'
  14379: |-
    Needless to say, it is beyond my station to render a decision on affairs of state.
    Wait here. I will consult with my superiors.${prompt}
  14380: It is as I expected. The Duchy will hold formal deliberations as to the potential repercussions of our involvement in this matter.${prompt}
  14381: |-
    Chin up, ${name-player}. The earnestness of the Empire's plea has not been lost on our diplomats.
    Perhaps the “Silent Empire” truly intends to change its ways...${prompt}
  14382: I can offer no promises, but encourage you to do what you can in the meantime.${prompt}
  14383: |-
    You make for the three nations from here, do you not?
    Then be on your way, and have faith that good tidings will await you upon your return.${prompt}

    Have you received consent from the three nations?
    Not yet, you say? Then I suggest you get moving.${prompt}

    The seals of the three nations...yes, everything seems to be in order.
    Good work.${prompt}
  14386: |-
    You'll be pleased to know that the Duchy has also agreed to give its consent.
    Here are the relevant papers.${prompt}
  14387: |-
    I trust you'll see that this matter ends well for all of us, ${name-player}.
    Now you'd best be on your way.${prompt}
  14388: You there. Yes, you, adventurer! Your downcast countenance tells me your life wants for exhilaration.${prompt}
  14389: 'Who am I, you ask? Let''s just say I''m he who is about to banish all trace of tedium from your life with an irresistible offer--one of otherworldly proportions, to be sure. For a mere ${number: 1} gil, this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} I hold is yours.${prompt}'
  14390: |-
    “But what in Slumbering Samwell's shank does it do,” you ask?
    Consider yourself fortunate, for it's my policy to demystify before the customer buys.${prompt}
  14391: |-
    What will you do?
    ${selection-lines}
    Let him ramble.
    Purchase ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.
    Learn how to use it.
    Discard abyssite.
    Leave.${prompt}
  14392: Ahem! Allow me to present you with a supposition.${prompt}
  14393: Lying in parallel to the world upon which we stand exists another dimension.${prompt}
  14394: |-
    “Abyssea” is its name--or at least, the name I've bestowed upon it.
    It is a world of boundless beauty, mystique, and riches unclaimed.${prompt}
  14395: |-
    Now, suppose this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} I hold is a key to accessing Abyssea.
    Were you in possession of one, your curiosity would get the better of you, yes?${prompt}
  14396: Strictly speaking, this object does not grant entry into Abyssea itself.${prompt}
  14397: It does, however, make it possible to interact with beings from that plane of existence--“Abysseans,” I call them.${prompt}
  14398: |-
    The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} serves to detect Abysseans that wander the gulf between worlds.
    How those hapless creatures--I refer to them as “Voidwalkers”--found their way there, mind you, is another subject entirely.${prompt}
  14399: 'Having drifted to this realm from the world yonder, much like the Voidwalkers themselves, ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are attuned to the presence of these creatures and will react--vibrate and emit light--when they draw near.${prompt}'
  14400: The closer your distance to a Voidwalker, the stronger the reaction becomes, until the creature is forcibly wrested into this dimension.${prompt}
  14401: 'Repeated contact with Abysseans will cause the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to take on different hues, allowing it to respond to creatures belonging to the higher echelons of Voidwalkers.${prompt}'
  14402: |-
    Be forewarned! Abysseans are among the most foul-tempered, unpredictable creatures.
    You would do well to steel yourself for a trying encounter prior to making contact.${prompt}
  14403: I trust your many adventures have made you familiar with those ghastly statues scattered across the land called cavernous maws.${prompt}
  14404: My observations have revealed that the concentration of Voidwalkers is greatest in locations where these statues are found.${prompt}
  14405: As yet, I have no plausible explanations for this phenomenon, but you needn't concern yourself with such details.${prompt}
  14406: Yours, my friend, is a dilemma infinitely simpler in nature.${prompt}
  14407: All this far-fetched talk of Abyssea, Abysseans, and Voidwalkers...${prompt}
  14408: I'm fully aware of the fantastical nature of my tale, and do not think poorly of those inclined to skepticism.${prompt}
  14409: |-
    Yet I feel no need to vouch further for the authenticity of my claims.
    Such is my confidence that the truth speaks for itself.${prompt}
  14410: |-
    Now then. A great new world has presented itself before you.
    The question is, will you embrace this opportunity, or let it pass you by?${prompt}
  14411: |-
    As Abysseans cross from one realm to another, so too does gil pass from one individual to the next.
    In my mind, it is only fitting that gil is that which grants you the key to Abyssea.${prompt}
  14412: |-
    My tales have piqued your interest, have they?
    As I have mentioned prior, the price is ${number: 0} gil.${prompt}
  14413: |-
    Hand over ${number: 0} gil?
    ${selection-lines}
    Aye.
    Nay.${prompt}
  14414: |-
    No? The sum I ask is by no means prohibitive.
    I'll be waiting here, should you ever change your mind.${prompt}
  14415: |-
    I thank you for your custom.
    Here is your very own ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}
  14416: 'As a service for all customers, upon request I will take your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} off your hands and dispose of it in your stead.${prompt}'
  14417: |-
    The ability to meddle with inter-dimensional matter can be considered a great power, with which comes great responsibility.
    Indeed there have been those who found the burden beyond their capacity to cope.${prompt}
  14418: It seems you are short on gil. Yet I cannot grant concessions, lest access to otherworldly realms lose its true value.${prompt}
  14419: 'I see you''ve developed a taste for ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}. Yet I fear I cannot furnish you further, for one alone is sufficient to invite misfortune upon the heedless.${prompt}'
  14420: |-
    You wish to know how to use the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?
    There is no trick to it. Allow me to demonstrate.${prompt}
  14421: |-
    While in possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, simply assume a resting pose.
    I'm given to understand it is second nature to all adventurers.${prompt}
  14422: 'Doing so will cause your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to react. Pertinent information can be gleaned by observing the magnitude of its vibration and the manner of light emitted.${prompt}'
  14423: Should neither reaction occur, take it to mean that no Voidwalkers roam the area.${prompt}
  14424: Should it vibrate softly but emit no light, take it to mean that Voidwalkers have recently passed through and may soon return.${prompt}
  14425: Should it vibrate softly and emit a gentle light, take it to mean that Voidwalkers presently roam the area.${prompt}
  14426: |-
    Now, pay particular attention to what I'm about to explain.
    The reaction of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will change once a predetermined distance from a Voidwalker has been closed.${prompt}
  14427: |-
    From that point onwards, the magnitude of the vibration corresponds directly to the creature's strength.
    Based on this knowledge, it is your decision whether to pursue it further.${prompt}
  14428: The gentle glow of light, on the other hand, will intensify to become a radiant beam pointing in the direction of the creature.${prompt}
  14429: Following that beam to its end will cause the heretofore invisible Voidwalker to cross fully over into this world and take form.${prompt}
  14430: This precise moment of encounter with an Abyssean, I have dubbed “contact.”${prompt}
  14431: Not only are Abysseans known to be temperamental and unpredictable; there are those that demonstrate a degree of cunning and guile far beyond that seen in this world.${prompt}
  14432: Consider yourself warned.${prompt}
  14433: 'For as surely as the beam of light emitted by the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} guides you to a Voidwalker, so too does it guide the Voidwalker to you. Be ever mindful of this fact.${prompt}'
  14434: Know also that not one, but numerous Voidwalkers may roam the land at any given time, and the readings indicate only the creature nearest you.${prompt}
  14435: You would do well to check the readings regularly, as a sudden change in the light's direction could mean a different Voidwalker has wandered your way.${prompt}
  14436: Voidwalkers will only reveal their true form at the point of contact, and seeking one only to be met with another is a scenario all adventurers want to avoid.${prompt}
  14437: |-
    But surely, you grow weary of my ramblings.
    I for one believe this is something best learned through doing.${prompt}
  14438: |-
    Has the burden of this responsibility proven too heavy to bear?
    Very well, I will take it off your hands and see to its disposal.${prompt}

  14449: |-
    Our predecessors were councilors and confidants to none other than the celebrated King Kupofried himself.
    To this day, it is our mission to safeguard the secrets of their moogle magic and see them properly passed down to posterity.${prompt}
  14450: |-
    Each illustrious member of the Magian Mooglehood guards knowledge of a distinct branch of our lineal lore.
    My specialty lies in weaponry; with my aid, you will be doling out damage and destruction in ways heretofore unimagined!${prompt}
  14451: “What impelled you to impart this long-withheld wisdom to us? And why now, kupo?” the unenlightened adventurer might ask.${prompt}
  14452: 'To which the wise moogle would readily reply: The answer, my friend, is in the mog tablets--those remarkable relics wrought by King Kupofried himself--that were only recently recovered by resourceful adventurers such as rrr...yourself.${prompt}'
  14453: |-
    There is an ancient (and somewhat alarming) prophecy in our mooglehood.
    It goes...<ahem>...“King Kupofried's creations shall slumber soundly until such time as their Super Kupowers are called upon to save the realm from utter ruin, kupo.”${prompt}
  14454: The particulars of the prophecy--preposterous as this may seem--outstrip even our prodigious powers of perception.${prompt}
  14455: 'Yet this I know, kupo: if moogle magic is what shall deliver this world from destruction, then moogle magic this world shall have--in abundance!${prompt}'
  14456: |-
    As an adventurer of renown, repute, and paramount prowess, you would seem a worthy beneficiary for our boon.
    And yet the Magian Mooglehood is nothing if not meticulously methodical. No, we must be certain...${prompt}
  14457: |-
    I propose to task you with a series of trials.
    Each time you emerge victorious, we shall proffer you a portion of our powers, kupo.${prompt}

    Will you undertake the Trial of the Magians, that you might one day wield the mightiest of moogle magic to save your realm from destruction and devastation?${prompt}

  14684: So, yeah! You can talk to Elder Orange when you've reached a certain level of experience, and he'll send you on all sorts of sadistic--er, challenging--trials. Complete them, and you can receive all kinds of nifty items and stuff.${prompt}
  14685: But what's even more exciting is the set of stupendously stylish job-specific poses that I can teach you, kupo!${prompt}

    Learn one, and you'll be able to use it even if you engage in a temporary career change.
    Why, it's the perfect way to share your profound passion for your chosen profession with the world!${prompt}
  14687: |-
    So here's the deal. In order to learn a gesture from me, you'll first need to achieve a certain level of proficiency in your chosen job.
    In the perplexing parlance of the Magian Mooglehood, we call that “level 30.”${prompt}
  14688: |-

    If you ever want to take a peek at your progress, just come back to me.

    So make especially sure that you don't lose the equipment, of course.
    If you do, how will I know your deed is done, kupo?${prompt}

    I truly can't emphasize it enough: take extra-special care of the item I give you until your trial is through!
    Are we clear, kupo?${prompt}
  14694: |-
    Complete one of my trials, and I'll teach you the corresponding gesture.
    My elders say that this knowledge will be imprinted in your memory as a “key item,” a term that is completely inscrutable to an initiate like me, kupo.${prompt}
  14695: |-

    Oh, I'm so terribly sorry! I don't think I can assign that trial to you yet.

    You'll have to complete or abandon one of your current trials before starting a new one.

    I'm afraid your mog sack has already been enlarged to its limits.
    We wouldn't want to have any...fabric malfunctions, would we, kupo?${prompt}

    I'm afraid your mog sack has reached its limits.
    Your gobbiebag, on the other hand, looks like it could still be tailored up in the right hands.${prompt}
  14748: The mog sack is a marvel of modern moogle craftsmanship, imbued with moogle magic that allows its capacity to be increased proportional to the size of your gobbiebag!${prompt}
  14749: |-
    How does that work, you ask? Let's just call it a moogle and Gobbie mystery!

    ...Luto.

    Mesmerizing! Who would have thought that moogles and Mithra--
    Wait a minute, who are you calling “sorry”!?${prompt}

    ...Indeed.

    Crisis? No crisis here! Nuh-uh!

    Hey, be a little more gentle with a lady, will ya?

    <Ahem>... Yes, yes.
    At any rate, the plight you suffer is not atypical of adventurers like yourself, kupo.${prompt}

    ${name-player} here has already reaped the fruits of my ingenuity. Is that not right, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  14791: Yes, this sensible and not-in-the-least-sadistic trial will see you to your goal with only the minimum required quota of charred skin and broken bones. This I vouch on the honor of the Magian Mooglehood, kupo.${prompt}
  14792: Now listen closely, as I do not have all day.${prompt}
  14793: "Long and hard did I ponder on a suitable task for partners such as the two of you. \nAnd I have found the answer...${prompt}"
  14794: |-
    A trial in tandem! Two hearts beating as one!
    You will cut through reams of foes in sublime synchronicity, with not a single step, not a single breath out of rhythm...or else!${prompt}
  14795: '...Ahem, kupo.${prompt}'
  14796: Pardon me. It would seem I got carried away with myself for a moment there.${prompt}

  14847: First and foremost, it's the key by which one gains entry to Abyssea.${prompt}

  14849: 'A single stone is good for a ${number: 1}-minute (Earth time) jaunt in Abyssea, and up to ${number: 2} can be in your possession at any given time. Multiplying those two numbers will give you the limit of your stay.${prompt}'

    Splendid! Your aid is a great boon to the resistance effort.

    Why, is that not ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} already in your posssesion?
    You need only insert that into a martello to initiate replenishment.${prompt}
  14885: |-
    I see that you currently possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.

  14887: |-
    Your support is most heartening in these dark times.
    Upgrading a martello will require you to attach a device known as ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
  14888: |-
    Mind you, the device is rather unwieldy.
    You will not be able to carry it and ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} at the same time.${prompt}
  14889: |-
    Excellent. I would be especially appreciative if you could upgrade those martellos in distant locations--the quicker the better.
    Be careful out there!${prompt}
  14890: |-
    Hm? Is that not ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} you hold in your hand?
    You need only find the martello you wish to upgrade, and attach it.${prompt}

    Do you wish to curtail your replenishment activities and assist with upgrading instead?${prompt}

    Welcome back, friend! Allow me to take that ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} off your hands.

    The resistance greatly values your contributions.
    Take this as a small token of our appreciation, and do not hesitate to return the next time you are willing to lend your support.${prompt}

    I've been working with these here martellos since I was knee-high.
    Ask away, and my knowledge is yours.${prompt}
  14896: |-
    Ask something?
    ${selection-lines}
    So, what's a martello?
    Martello replenishment.
    Martello upgrades.
    Cautionary notes.
    Not now.${prompt}
  14897: |-
    The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war.
    Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.${prompt}
  14898: You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.${prompt}
  14899: In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.${prompt}
  14900: |-
    This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers.
    Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.${prompt}
  14901: That being the case, we're in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.${prompt}
  14902: |-
    I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel.
    Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word.
    Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.${prompt}
  14903: |-
    Feast your eyes on this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. She's a beauty, isn't she?
    Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.${prompt}
  14904: |-
    An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations.
    Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.${prompt}
  14905: |-
    Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex.

    Data that an elite team of our best researchers works tirelessly to analyze.${prompt}
  15028: |-
    Yes, we must discover a means to seal the rifts once and for all.
    Then, and only then, will victory truly be ours.${prompt}
  15029: Until that day, we have no choice but to continue the fight.${prompt}
  15030: You have proven yourself a valuable ally to our cause.${prompt}
  15031: |-
    The Archduke himself trusts you greatly.
    That is one trust that you would do well not to betray.${prompt}

    Heh... ${name-player} goes where adventure calls.
    But you can always trust ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to show up when the time is right.${prompt}
  15041: |-
    Kupo-ho!
    ...So that's how it works.${prompt}
  15042: |-
    Well, look who's finally here.
    I was wondering how long you were going to keep me waitaruing.${prompt}
  15043: Hm? Why's that?${prompt}
  15044: |-
    Surely you haven't forgotten-wotten our contract, ${name-player}.
    I intend to keep my end of the bargain, so you'd bettaru live up to yours.${prompt}
  15045: 'Your mission, whether or not you choose to acceptaru it: amass ${number: 0} merit point${choice-plurality: 0}[/s] and return here to me.${prompt}'
  15046: |-
    Why, you say?
    Oh, just a little experiment of sorts.${prompt}
  15047: I've devised a method by which the power of merit points may be channel-wanneled to rip and wrench open the reserves of chakra that lie dormant within you.${prompt}
  15048: |-
    Getting excitarued yet? 'Cause I sure am.
    So what are you waiting for? ${number: 0} merit point${choice-plurality: 0}[/s], and make it snappy-wappy.${prompt}
  15049: |-
    Rip and wrench?
    That sounds awfully...violent, kupo.${prompt}
  15050: |-
    Indeed...
    And yet, it's a most accurate description. Heh heh...${prompt}
  15051: Kupopo?${prompt}
  15052: |-
    Hear me out, ${name-player}.
    Be strong of body and mind, and there is no limit to the powers you can master.${prompt}
  15053: You didn't sign that contract for the all-you-can-eat rarab tails, now, did you?${prompt}
  15054: |-
    Believe in yourself, and go forward, ${name-player}.
    Your destiny awaits.${prompt}
  15055: |-
    Back so soon?
    That's our ${name-player}!${prompt}
  15056: Heh. Never met a challenge ye didn't like, eh?${prompt}
  15057: |-
    Wow, you completed that task in a jiffy-wiffy.
    Looks like I made the right choice signing a contract with you.${prompt}
  15058: |-
    Well then, let's get this show on the road.
    Don't worry, ${name-player}--it'll be over in two shakes of a rarab's tail.${prompt}
  15059: |-
    Kupopo?
    Is it prudent to proceed with the process so promptly?${prompt}
  15060: |-
    Under normal circumstances, we'd take things a bit more slowly-wowly.
    But hey, ${name-player} and I are people in demand. Aren't we, ${name-player}?${prompt}
  15061: When I say go, we're going to condense all the merit power you've accumulated into one pulsating mass of energy, then proceed to rippy-wip that straight out from the core of your soul.${prompt}
  15062: |-
    Stay focused, and try not to blink.
    It might kill you.${prompt}
  15063: K-kupo!?${prompt}
  15064: '...${prompt}'
  15065: And that should do it!${prompt}
  15066: Did we kill ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]?${prompt}
  15067: Kupo...oh!?${prompt}
  15068: I've noted this numerous times before, but you really have a remarkably resilient body, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  15069: It's all the trainin' ${choice-player-gender}[he's/she's] put in with yours truly.${prompt}
  15070: |-
    Stand tall and proud...er, if you can still stand.
    The legendary power of the bushin is yours.${prompt}
  15071: Kupo!? C'est comme ça qu'on transmet le pouvoir du bushin!?${prompt}
  15072: On dirait que vous essayez juste de faire exploser les pauvres ${name-player} en miettes!${prompt}
  15073: Plus ou moins. C'est le choc du blastaru combiné à la puissance accumulée des points de mérite de ${name-player} qui déclenche la réaction.${prompt}
  15074: By focusing all of those energies into one pulsating mass and ripping it out from within, we've opened up a veritable font of chakra inside ${name-player}'s body.${prompt}
  15075: A font...of chakra, kupo?${prompt}
  15076: They say such stores of power exist inside us all, yet most will train a lifetime without ever learnin' how to tap into 'em...${prompt}
  15077: |-
    You laid the foundation with your physical enhancements experiments, my fluttery, furry friend.
    I simply-wimply applied the finishing touches.${prompt}
  15078: |-
    But let's get to the heart of the mattaru, ${name-player}.
    What I've bestowed upon you today is but a foundation for powers that may yet be mastered.${prompt}
  15079: |-
    Listen, and listen well.
    Look within and take stock of your merits, and you'll see a new path open to you.${prompt}
  15080: |-
    Using the energies within you, I've burned into your soul the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.
    How you proceed from here is entirely up to you.${prompt}
  15081: |-
    For this is not the end of your training, but only the beginning.
    Or were you just bluffing-wuffing when you said you wanted to take me on? Haha!${prompt}
  15082: |-
    And with that, I'd best be off.
    I am a man in demand, after all.${prompt}
  15083: Before that, though, I really could use a good meal and a...<yawn>...nap.${prompt}
  15084: A man in demand? More like a lazy louse, kupo.${prompt}
  15085: |-
    As enigmatic as our friend is, the realm may never know.
    Heh heh...${prompt}
  15086: |-
    Let up not in your training, ${name-player}. The path to true martial mastery lies before you.
    Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some rarab tails t'--er, I mean, my trainin' to get back to.${prompt}
  15087: You learned the secret technique of the bushin!${prompt}
  15088: |-
    You've come. Splendid.
    We regret having to summon you again so soon after your last tour of duty, but the Duchy has need of your services again.${prompt}
  15089: Our research team has confirmed the presence of new rifts in the greater three nations area.${prompt}
  15090: |-
    Under normal circumstances, the defense effort would fall under the jurisdiction of the local governments.
    This time, however, I fear the circumstances are far from normal.${prompt}
  15091: |-
    I will be frank with you, ${name-player}.
    The strength of the enemy is beyond anything we've faced thus far.${prompt}
  15092: |-
    Here is your badge of authorization.
    Take it and report to the Voidwatch officers stationed afield for further orders.${prompt}
  15093: |-
    Once again, we have recruited other promising adventurers to our cause.
    You may find it in your best interests to join up with them before taking on the enemy.
    We're counting on you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
  15094: |-
    I trust you've recovered from your last tour of duty.
    If not, so be it. Full strength or no, the Duchy requires your service.${prompt}
  15095: Ducal researchers have alerted us to the presence of newly formed planar rifts in the vicinity of the three kingdoms.${prompt}
  15096: |-
    Under normal circumstances we would let the nations fend for themselves.
    We fear that this time, however, their limited resources and manpower will do little to stem the tide of this formidable enemy.${prompt}
  15097: |-
    Hence, we turn to you.
    Take this badge of authorization and present it to our officers afield for further orders.${prompt}
  15098: |-
    We have recruited others for the effort as well.
    Join forces with them if you wish, or fight alone.
    Just remember: the success of the operation is more important than the life of any single soldier, including yours.${prompt}
  15099: As we trust you are already aware...${prompt}
  15100: |-
    Direct supervision of the Voidwatch operation will be conducted by our officers dispatched to the three nations.
    You are to follow their instructions to the letter.${prompt}
  15101: ${name-player}. Once again you prove that the Duchy's faith in you was not misplaced.${prompt}
  15102: |-
    You are an asset to the Voidwatch.
    And yet the data we have recovered from your efforts yields as many questions as answers.${prompt}
  15103: |-
    The Voidwalker menace has been quieted for now.
    Yet we would be fools to believe that our foe will remain silent for long.${prompt}
  15104: Until we can identify and eliminate the source of the threat, we have no recourse but to call upon you again.${prompt}
  15105: |-
    In the meantime, take this as recompense for your efforts.
    I trust you shall put it to good use.${prompt}
  15106: What is the meaning of this interruption!?${prompt}
  15107: |-
    My pardons. Your Excellency, we've received dire news from the field.
    Two new rifts have been confirmed at previously unbreached locations...${prompt}
  15108: Hmph. Two, you say?${prompt}
  15109: Aye. One buried in the sands of the Valkurm Dunes, the other on Buburimu Peninsula.${prompt}
  15110: Your Excellency...?${prompt}
  15111: |-
    This adventurer is a veteran Voidwatcher.
    I would have ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] hear your findings as well.${prompt}
  15112: |-
    At present, it responds to neither ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} nor ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.
    We are unable to gauge the potential danger of any Voidwalkers that may lie beyond.${prompt}
  15113: |-
    Intriguing.
    So the portal between dimensions is not yet fully formed...${prompt}
  15114: |-
    It is only a matter of time before the monsters spring forth.
    Let up your watch not for a second, and send word the moment you detect anything amiss.${prompt}
  15115: Sir! Yes, sir!${prompt}
  15116: It would seem your next mission will begin sooner rather than later, soldier.${prompt}
  15117: |-
    We will authorize you for participation at such time as it is necessary.
    In the meantime, I suggest you rest up and prepare yourself for the challenges ahead.${prompt}
  15118: |-
    Too much remains unknown about these rifts.
    I grow impatient with our researchers and their incessant pleas for more time.${prompt}
  15119: |-
    I concur. The situation threatens to spiral out of control.
    We cannot afford to play the dispassionate observer for much longer.${prompt}
  15120: ${name-player} has proved a most useful...resource...in the pursuit of our goals.${prompt}
  15121: |-
    And yet there are limits to what one adventurer--or even an army of them--can do.
    It seems that we have no choice but to get involved more...directly.${prompt}
  15122: '...Yes, Your Excellency.${prompt}'
  15123: |-
    It would seem the Voidwatch effort in the three nations was a success.
    Once again, you prove yourself not entirely useless.${prompt}
  15124: |-
    The Archduke will be pleased.
    And yet the Voidwalker menace persists.${prompt}
  15125: The data we have recovered from your latest mission is...not promising.${prompt}
  15126: |-
    More details? I think you forget your station, soldier.
    You will get the information you are authorized to receive, and no more.${prompt}
  15127: |-
    Let it suffice to say that we will have need of your services again.
    Stay alive, and do not stray too far.${prompt}
  15128: |-
    I am sure you understand why we have summoned you on such short notice.
    Yes, it does indeed concern the Voidwalkers.${prompt}
  15129: Recently, however, some new facts have come to light. Reports confirm a new substance that can be culled from those planes-walking fiends.${prompt}
  15130: 'It is said to possess two separate forms: one is that of a crystal, the other of a more granular structure resembling cruor. Its alabaster hue, however, serves to distinguish it from that vermilion currency.${prompt}'
  15131: While it may exhibit crystalline properties, it is unlike any specimen of crystal we have heretofore examined. The oft-used phrase “shrouded in mystery” does not begin to describe how it baffles even our most accomplished researchers.${prompt}
  15132: We may have nothing more to guide us than conjecture, but we cannot discard the possibility that this mineral is an integral piece in the calamitous puzzle that Vana'diel faces. Do not hesitate to collect as large a sample as possible of this mysterious mineral.${prompt}
  15133: Should you require further intelligence, seek out a Voidwatch Officer. As they are the ones who operate in the field, they should be privy to the most current of information.${prompt}
  15134: Furthermore...${prompt}
  15135: Whether as hardened stone or dust deposits, this substance is less than abundant.${prompt}
  15136: Voidwatch Officers should be willing to part with some samples, however, should you fail to harvest any off of Voidwalker corpses.${prompt}
  15137: No matter the method by which you obtain it, this mineral should shine new light on this catastrophe and allow you to more efficiently aid our cause.${prompt}
  15138: To the extent of our knowledge, there is no new planar rift activity, but you of all people should understand the spontaneous nature of these interdimensional disturbances. None of us can let our guard down for even a moment.${prompt}
  15139: |-
    Archduke Kam'lanaut expects great things of you as well.
    It is quite regrettable that he could not honor us with his presence today, but he is a busy man with many entice--er, engagements.${prompt}
  15140: Now that you understand how you can be of service, it is time you got to your duties. Let us conclude this parley.${prompt}
  15141: Hmm...something's not right here.${prompt}
  15142: I would have expected their reports to have arrived by now...${prompt}
  15143: Who's this then? An adventurer, I gather?${prompt}
  15144: |-
    Well? Are you?
    ${selection-lines}
    Of course!
    No...${prompt}
  15145: Please forgive my intrusion.${prompt}
  15146: I wish you well in all your endeavors.${prompt}
  15147: To find an adventurer such as yourself so quickly! Fortune indeed shines upon me this day!${prompt}
  15148: But where are my manners? I have not yet introduced myself. I am Anastase, an emissary sent from the Sacred City of Adoulin.${prompt}
  15149: But of course, you need not say anything. I know why you have sought me out.${prompt}
  15150: You are here to assist me in surveying the geomagnetic founts, yes?${prompt}
  15151: |-
    Lend your aid?
    ${selection-lines}
    I shall.
    Not interested.
    Hear more.${prompt}
  15152: I see. I must admit to feeling a twinge of disappointment, but I understand.${prompt}
  15153: My stay here will be a long one, so if you have a change of heart, please come and see me again.${prompt}
  15154: Have you changed your mind? Will you help me study the geomagnetic founts?${prompt}
  15155: I come from the Sacred City of Adoulin, an island that lies far to the west, beyond the great Sea of Zafmlug.${prompt}
  15156: Further still beyond the island is the continent of Ulbuka, where a pristine expanse of nature sits unsullied by mortal hands.${prompt}
  15157: Tales of men and women from the Middle Lands who cannot resist the clarion call of a good deed left undone have stretched across the sea and reached my ears. Hearing these tales prompted me to make the arduous journey here.${prompt}
  15158: For you see, I desire your assistance in our quest to pioneer the undeveloped lands of Ulbuka.${prompt}
  15159: I had hoped to secure transport in advance for those interested in cooperating with this enterprise.${prompt}
  15160: But executing a plan is never a simple affair. Air and sea vessels are indeed available, but unsustainable in the long term due to the staggering distance between the two continents.${prompt}
  15161: Yet one possibility exists. In our beloved city, devices called “waypoints” allow the user to instantaneously move from one location to another.${prompt}
  15162: However, I am not certain whether the ley lines to which these waypoints are attuned traverse the oceans to the Middle Lands. My first task, therefore, is to find locations suitable for such travel.${prompt}
  15163: '${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are needed to use our waypoints, but their efficacy is dependent on recording the energies of certain geomagnetic founts.${prompt}'
  15164: 'As part of this mission, I have brought with me several such ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}. What I would ask of you is that you take one to these various founts and attune it to them.${prompt}'
  15165: Unfortunately, there is precious little time to collect this information.${prompt}
  15166: As I have previously mentioned, my fervent hope is that you will undertake this mission. The very fate of my homeland hangs in the balance.${prompt}
  15167: 'What I ask is that you use ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to...oh?${prompt}'
  15168: 'You mean to tell me that you already possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}? Then this will be all the easier!${prompt}'
  15169: 'This ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} for the Middle Lands.${prompt}'
  15170: 'What I would ask of you is that you attune the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to the aforementioned geomagnetic founts.${prompt}'
  15171: If this survey is successful, then it will surely guarantee a prosperous trading partnership for our two homelands.${prompt}
  15172: I also imagine that there are many who would both honor and value your accomplishment.${prompt}
  15173: 'Your help is sincerely appreciated. Let me present you with this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}'
  15174: Attuning it to a geomagnetic fount will, if my calculations are correct, permit you to use the waypoints.${prompt}
  15175: I have already recorded the energies of the Ru'Lude Gardens fount. Please, travel throughout the world and proceed with your activities, and return to me when you have attuned it to another fount.${prompt}
  15176: Having never been to this land, I am not familiar with the exact locations, but our powers of divination have given us a certain cryptic insight.${prompt}
  15177: |-
    Any questions?
    ${selection-lines}
    Tell me your prognostications.
    Tell me about these waypoints.

  15186: Well, this certainly is quite perplexing. I only apologize that I cannot help you further.${prompt}
  15187: 'If you solve these riddles and find a geomagnetic fount, all you must do is hold up your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to the location.${prompt}'
  15188: Quite a simple task, no?${prompt}
  15189: 'I shall be waiting here to collect your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} when you have completed this endeavor.${prompt}'
  15190: Many years have I spent researching and analyzing these phenomena. Sensing any changes in the object I have given you is merely a trifle.${prompt}
  15191: To a layman's eyes, though, any deviations are impossible to detect.${prompt}
  15192: My hope is that, should these portals become fully active, even the uninitiated will be able to make such determinations with ease.${prompt}
  15193: I am sure you have noticed this mysterious device resting at my side. In Adoulin, we refer to items of its ilk as “waypoints.”${prompt}
  15194: 'These portals enable instantaneous transportation between two locations simply by holding up ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to them.${prompt}'
  15195: I am sure that now you understand the implications of my calling--if the geomagnetic founts are as strong as our research implies, then the waypoints should function here, as well.${prompt}
  15196: As we record information about the founts, we should be able to warp between more locations.${prompt}
  15197: However, there is always a price to be paid for convenience. Warping consumes a tiny bit of energy extracted from certain types of crystals.${prompt}
  15198: 'This energy, which in my field''s parlance is referred to as “kinetic units,” is imbued in ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} when extracted from these crystals.${prompt}'
  15199: Kinetic units are consumed each time you warp, meaning that periodic imbuing is necessary for continued use of the waypoints.${prompt}
  15200: Ah yes, before I forget--other members of my expedition have already gone to survey these locations.${prompt}
  15201: Should you happen to cross paths with them, make sure to emphasize that I am still waiting for their reports.${prompt}
  15202: May Altana keep you safe in this quest.${prompt}

  15205: This...this is amazing!${prompt}
  15206: 'You have traveled to the ${number: 0} locations I have requested and recorded the data in the geomagnetic founts there!${prompt}'
  15207: Adventurers are truly as reliable as I was led to believe. All in a day's work, I suppose.${prompt}
  15208: You have my undying gratitude for your efforts. Allow me to present this to you as a mere token of my appreciation.${prompt}
  15209: As an aside, did you happen to meet with any of the other members of my expedition?${prompt}
  15210: Though a bit wet behind the ears, their skills and talents are unparalleled.${prompt}
  15211: Among their ranks are geomancers and rune fencers--a rare sight in the Middle Lands, to be sure.${prompt}
  15212: If you were to visit Adoulin, you may be able to find out about their secrets for yourself.${prompt}
  15213: Forgive my loose tongue. Some things should be found out for oneself.${prompt}
  15214: My efforts now are focused on obtaining information about any more geomagnetic founts that may exist. I may have more information for you at a later date.${prompt}

    Are you an initiate?
    ${selection-lines}

  15500: No? Then perhaps I need to take a break. I thought I read your magical aura properly, but my endless hours of study must have taken their toll.${prompt}
  15501: Well, there was the one gentlewoman who claims to have called forth an alter ego all by herself.${prompt}
  15502: Could you imagine what this means for our research? We may be on the verge of an incredible breakthrough!${prompt}
  15503: Rumors say that intimate knowledge of the person she was trying to summon was sufficient to complete the ritual. So here I am, researching, trying to replicate her success with a historical figure.${prompt}
  15504: 'But it''s no good. Without the bonds, we just can''t do it! The closest we''ve come is to craft ciphers--magical parchments that concentrate energies from a third party into physical forms. But that''s the rub: it still requires those bonds in the first place.${prompt}'

  15509: 'Take this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} as a gift from the institute. It''s a cipher crafted from the very process I spoke of earlier.${prompt}'
  15510: The emotions of separate individuals converted into magical energy. Extraordinary, wouldn't you agree? Calling forth an alter ego with the thoughts of a third party.${prompt}
  15511: It's all very experimental, so I make no promises as to the efficacy of such a scroll. It's all we can do to keep the energies from collapsing in on themselves.${prompt}
  15512: Unlike a traditional scroll, these ciphers cannot be recited by anyone with a passing level of literacy. They require the assistance of certain institute staff located in major cities throughout Vana'diel.${prompt}
  15513: Still, I promise the journey will be worth it...for you, and for us.${prompt}
  15514: Bonds cannot be severed like a hot knife cutting through Selbina butter. The key is whether or not the strengths of the bonds' creators are enough to survive transcription.${prompt}
  15515: If there's someone who you feel a strong connection with, what can it hurt to ask them for their cooperation? You'll never know until you try!${prompt}

  15517: 'Hm? You''re here about ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}?${prompt}'
  15518: I'm sorry you came all this way, but I've already been briefed on that particular topic.${prompt}
  15519: Wait just a moment. Ah, now I remember you. Yes, I've been looking for you ever since our last encounter. Now, I need you in the field to help with my research...${prompt}
  15520: Ah, forgive me. I was so excited to find the person I was looking for, I forgot to explain what it is I'm doing.${prompt}
  15521: I've heard from a colleague that my research into Trust magic has earned the recognition of an academic organization.${prompt}
  15522: They have even given me clearance to read their most confidential documents in pursuit of my research. Well, a portion of them at least.${prompt}
  15523: However, when comparing that information against what I had gathered, I came across some interesting discoveries.${prompt}
  15524: For example, I learned that you had defeated an unusual life-form considered to be the physical embodiment of the darkest parts of a person's soul.${prompt}
  15525: Then it struck me--a new line of thought in my Trust magic research.${prompt}
  15526: That's right. I'm researching the topic of a dark Trust magic!${prompt}
  15527: |-
    How will you respond?
    ${selection-lines}
    Dark Trust magic?
    I see where this is going.${prompt}
  15528: Huh? You mean you don't know?${prompt}
  15529: Oh you do, do you?${prompt}
  15530: Well, allow me to briefly explain things just in case.${prompt}
  15531: Currently, the Trust magic you use is based on light. It draws on positive forces such as trust, friendship, and ${choice-player-gender}[brotherly/sisterly] love.${prompt}
  15532: On the other hand, Trust magic based on darkness draws upon negative forces to generate its magic, much like how that woman was able to accomplish what she did.${prompt}
  15533: Oh, I suppose I'm leaving out some rather important information. That is to say, an explanation of the negative aspects of mankind's darker side.${prompt}
  15534: I'm basically referring to things like apathy, arrogance, cowardice, envy, and rage. You know, the darkest parts of one's soul. I believe that everybody harbors these feelings, at least to a certain extent.${prompt}
  15535: In a sense, all of us are united by the darkness within our souls. Therefore, it only seems logical to infer that we have the necessary conditions to employ Trust magic from it.${prompt}
  15536: All that remains is to try and elevate the darkness within the alter ego's soul and somehow link up with it...a type of bond all its own.${prompt}
  15537: 'Although, even if we are unable to utilize the Trust magic, we have the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} at our disposal. Intimate knowledge of your quarry should enable you to form a bond with them.${prompt}'
  15538: Which brings me to my request. I'd like for you to test your mettle against those unique forces. However, it cannot be any regular fight. You must really get to know your opponent.${prompt}
  15539: I requested the A.M.A.N. to create a Records of Eminence objective for this purpose, so it should help you remain cognizant of your opponent during battle.${prompt}
  15540: Hm? You want to know how to fight this particular opponent again? I think you probably know more about that sort of thing than I do.${prompt}
  15541: You learn more about Trust magic, and I get further along in my research. That's what I call a “win-win.”${prompt}
  15542: I heard from my colleague that he obtained a rather unusual cipher. Perhaps you should see this through to its conclusion?${prompt}
  15543: Ah, it's you again. It seems everything went rather well.${prompt}
  15544: Judging by the magical aura you're giving off, I'd say we got the results I was hoping for.${prompt}
  15545: Keep in mind that Trust magic research is an ongoing process. I must continue my efforts to unlock its mysteries.${prompt}
  15546: I'm working on preparations for my next study. Please come by again later.${prompt}
  15547: Hello again. I've finished making the necessary preparations. This is the data I'm searching for this time.${prompt}
  15548: Thanks again for your help.${prompt}
  15549: If the test results for this darkness-based Trust magic follow my hypothesis, then my next step will be to research Trust magic that combines the power of both light and darkness.${prompt}
  15550: I believe Trust magic that combines the power of light and darkness no longer just gives rise to alter egos, but a unique form of existence.${prompt}
  15551: An alter ego combining the power of both light and darkness... Just think of what this could mean!${prompt}
  15552: Although, I'm currently suffering from a lack of research samples.${prompt}
  15553: In order to successfully realize dark-based Trust magic, I tried replicating the connection that my research was based on, but it is not going so well...${prompt}
  15554: If only I could get to the truth of the matter, it could be like a ticket to eternal paradise without the unfortunate precursor of dying first.${prompt}
  15555: Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Rolandienne in Southern San d'Oria (G-10).

  15672: I am pleased to see you make such a wise decision! Hehe... I cannot wait to see that buffoon Jamal choke on his own words!${prompt}
  15673: Now then! Jamal likes to equate the darkness of alter egos to the root of all evil or some such nonsense, but as with most things, he could not be more wrong.${prompt}
  15674: These are just my thoughts on the issue, but...${prompt}
  15675: You see, unlike Jamal, I do not believe that Trust magic is something meant to be cast outwards from its user.${prompt}
  15676: No, Trust magic is designed to look within us. In other words...${prompt}
  15677: The alter egos take shape due to the power contained within a kind of unseen pipeline inside of us that conveys our feelings and thoughts to them.${prompt}
  15678: That got me thinking! If one could somehow boost the amount of those feelings and thoughts being sent...${prompt}
  15679: It could lead to the alter ego itself becoming even more powerful!${prompt}
  15680: Hm? What do you mean you don't understand? You really are quite dense, aren't you?${prompt}
  15681: Well, I am stuck with you, I guess, so you will need a few things if you are to help me with my research.${prompt}
  15682: First of all, you will need this special diamond.${prompt}
  15683: It is capable of detecting the feelings and thoughts you direct at the alter ego you are summoning.${prompt}
  15684: This diamond then stores them within its crystalline confines.${prompt}
  15685: Once it has gathered a certain amount of thoughts and feelings, it will change color.${prompt}
  15686: So basically, I need you to use your Trust magic until you see the diamond change color!${prompt}
  15687: To help you to that end, I have also prepared something else for you.${prompt}
  15688: I ordered the A.M.A.N. to provide you with a list of Records of Eminence objectives!${prompt}
  15689: There are three objectives for you to complete. You simply need to complete them all to collect what is necessary!${prompt}
  15690: Ah, that reminds me. No matter what, you must not lose this diamond.${prompt}
  15691: It is made from an extremely rare gemstone, so I forced my mother's jewelry shop to let me have it.${prompt}
  15692: It was originally a rather unusual diamond that changed color whenever it sensed a change in the surrounding temperature.${prompt}
  15693: I simply used a little magic to make some key improvements and recreate something from a legend I once heard in a faraway land!${prompt}
  15694: Now then, let us begin the experiment!${prompt}
  15695: Ah, there you are! I was expecting you much sooner. Hurry up and hand me the diamond already.${prompt}
  15696: Hmm... Very well done. You have collected just the right amount of thoughts and feelings. Now, for just a touch of magic...${prompt}
  15697: I-it's a staggering success! The thoughts have been imbued into the diamond!${prompt}
  15698: Listen carefully. You simply need to use this diamond as a catalyst when invoking your Trust magic.${prompt}
  15699: When you do, the thoughts sent to your alter ego when it manifests will be made even more powerful.${prompt}
  15700: That power will then be sent to the alter ego when you attempt to call upon it.${prompt}
  15701: As a result, the alter ego itself will also become stronger!${prompt}
  15702: However, there is one thing you need to be careful of.${prompt}
  15703: The more of these pipelines you use to call forth the alter egos, the weaker the effect of the catalyst will become.${prompt}
  15704: I can see that your feeble mind is not comprehending what I am saying. Let me see, how can I dumb this down so even you can understand it...${prompt}
  15705: If your party is made up of you and five alter egos, that means that five pipelines will be used, so each alter ego will only be slightly powered up.${prompt}
  15706: And if your party contains you and one other member, along with four alter egos, that means there would be four alter ego pipelines and each one will be a little stronger.${prompt}
  15707: Finally, if there are five in your party along with only one alter ego, that means there is also only one alter ego pipeline, so it will be made considerably stronger.${prompt}
  15708: Do you understand now? Yes? I am glad to hear it.${prompt}
  15709: Take note that the catalyst will not be effective unless you yourself are of considerable strength.${prompt}
  15710: You must be strong if you wish to extract the power from the catalyst.${prompt}
  15711: Now get out there and experience the fruits of my research for yourself!${prompt}

  15996: Mandragora Mania is a game in which you battle for jingly by moving your mandragora pieces to the goal.${prompt}
  15997: 'Your goal is the ${choice: 0}[red/blue/green] one on the right, while your opponent''s is the ${choice: 0}[blue/green/red] one on the left.${prompt}'
  15998: At the start of the game, three mandragoras each will be placed on the eight game areas, excluding the goal.${prompt}
  15999: There are five starting placements (A through E), and you are able to select which one you would like to employ. The default setting is "Random."${prompt}
  16000: This explanation uses pattern A, but the basic rules are the same regardless of the starting pattern.${prompt}
  16001: 'The three ${choice: 0}[red/blue/green] areas in front of you are yours,${wait-36: 2}the three ${choice: 0}[blue/green/red] areas at the back are your opponent''s,${wait-36: 2}and the remaining two are neutral.${prompt}'
  16002: You must choose one area--either yours or a neutral one--to proceed.${prompt}
  16003: The areas are numbered from one to five starting from the left, and any mandragoras in the area you select will move.${prompt}
  16004: Conversely, your opponent must select either a neutral area or an area that belongs to them.${prompt}
  16005: From the right, those areas are numbered 6, 4, 7, 2, and 8.${prompt}
  16006: 'For example, if you select Area 1,${wait-36: 4}one mandragora will move to Area 2${wait-36: 1}and one will move to Area 3,${wait-36: 1}and one will move to Area 4.${prompt}'
  16007: Note that the mandragoras will move from the back first--last in, first out.${prompt}
  16008: You will receive points known as “jingly” each time one of your mandragoras reaches the goal.${prompt}
  16009: You will enter your opponent's territory whenever you go past the goal.${prompt}
  16010: If one of your mandragoras happens to reach the opponent's goal, the goal will be pushed back and your mandragora will return to your own area. You don't have to worry about your mandragora earning any jingly for your opponent.${prompt}
  16011: The order in which players choose areas will be determined based on your turn settings. The default setting is random.${prompt}
  16012: This explanation has skipped past your opponent's turn for demonstration purposes, but in the actual game you and your opponent will take turns choosing areas.${prompt}
  16013: However, if the last mandragora to move reaches the goal, you will get to take an additional turn.${prompt}
  16014: Mandragoras are a very diverse species, and the amount of jingly you earn is determined by the species of mandragora that crosses into the goal.${prompt}
  16015: 'Adenium and citrullus: 3 jingly (first player)/4 jingly (second player).${prompt}'

    I need you to find her and return this basket for me.
    She forgot it in all of the hoopla.${prompt}

    You should first pay a visit to the junk dealer known as Muckvix in Lower Jeuno.

    Somehow, I found myself covered in various scrapes and bruises.

    Well, I suppose you're right.
    I hear the Goblins have resumed preparations for their festival as well.${prompt}
  16095: If you're interested in the festival, miss, you should go speak with the Goblins.${prompt}
  16096: I'd hurry up before they change their minds.${prompt}
  16097: Oh, yes, of course! I'll go at once!${prompt}
  16098: |-
    Now then...
    You there. You look familiar.${prompt}
  16099: |-
    I'm Shami.
    We've conducted some business together in the past.${prompt}
  16100: |-
    My name is Shami.
    I trade in rather unusual items back in Port Jeuno with adventurers much like yourself.${prompt}
  16101: |-
    That there is Shemo.
    We're kind of like what you'd call brothers.${prompt}
  16102: |-
    We both know you quite well.
    You've made quite the reputation for yourself around here.${prompt}
  16103: |-
    Anyway, in regards to Maat...
    Everything we told that girl was made up.${prompt}
  16104: She'd probably feel bad if she knew the truth.${prompt}
  16105: 'You see, it was the ${item-singular: 1[2]} she made Maat eat that caused that to happen to him.${prompt}'
  16106: Maat probably mentioned something about her paying him handsomely to help train her, yes?${prompt}
  16107: |-
    That's the problem, you see. Her “payment” to him was a boiled egg.
    In fact, I believe it's one you're quite familiar with.${prompt}
  16108: |-
    You mean...
    ${selection-lines}
    The World Eater Egg!?
    The ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}!?
    An initial egg!?${prompt}
  16109: I'm afraid so!${prompt}
  16110: Nope, guess again!${prompt}
  16111: Wow, you're really gonna make me spell it out for you, aren't ya!?${prompt}
  16112: Anyway...${prompt}
  16113: |-
    Fortunately, the World Eater Egg he ate had deteriorated rather significantly.
    As such, it probably could've been much, much worse for him.${prompt}
  16114: You see, while he was awake, he was able to somehow contain the power that radiated from within him.${prompt}
  16115: But whenever he fell asleep, he transformed into that monster, which you saw for yourself.${prompt}
  16116: |-
    Heh heh heh.
    Although, thanks to your battle against him, the power of the egg seems to have diminished even further, for now at least.${prompt}
  16117: |-
    You can leave the matter to us.
    We'll see that the rest of the egg's power is absorbed and sealed away properly.${prompt}
  16118: The mysterious shadow that's been haunting this place each night shouldn't be a problem any longer.${prompt}
  16119: |-
    Here, this is for your troubles.
    I have a feeling you'll be needing it before this is all over.${prompt}
  16120: |-
    I've got something from Shami and Shemo that they wanted me to give to you.
    Here you go.${prompt}
  16121: After talking to Shami and Shemo, I feel like a great weight has been lifted from these tired shoulders.${prompt}
  16122: |-
    I heard they possess some rather mysterious abilities, but I'm sure glad they were here to help.
    Heh heh heh.${prompt}
