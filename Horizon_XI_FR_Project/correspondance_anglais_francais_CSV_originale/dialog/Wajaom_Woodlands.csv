Let us rethink this from a scientific standpoint, shall we?${prompt};Eh!?${prompt}
First of all, it is clear that the tissue mutation is merely a physiological reaction to a particular medium that has been introduced into the victim's body via the sound waves of the frog song.${prompt};Let us rethink this from a scientific standpoint, shall we?${prompt}

That was to be the focal point of this expedition's research.${prompt};...or simply act as a catalyst, activating a genetic medium already present in the victim's body, I cannot say.${prompt}
As for the victim's actions while in the transmogrified state, it seems that one loses the ability of voluntary thought, leaving him susceptible to the will of the caster.${prompt};That was to be the focal point of this expedition's research.${prompt}
We can derive from this that the Poroggo must be sending some type of neural signal directly to the victim's brain.${prompt};As for the victim's actions while in the transmogrified state, it seems that one loses the ability of voluntary thought, leaving him susceptible to the will of the caster.${prompt}
I believe this signal may also affect the medium I spoke of earlier.${prompt};We can derive from this that the Poroggo must be sending some type of neural signal directly to the victim's brain.${prompt}
By taking control of the nervous system, the Poroggo is able to override the victim's natural defenses--in particular, the defenses that prevent foreign mediums from invading the body.${prompt};I believe this signal may also affect the medium I spoke of earlier.${prompt}
The signal also may trigger the spontaneous generation of a new medium in the body by stimulating certain areas of the cerebral cortex.${prompt};By taking control of the nervous system, the Poroggo is able to override the victim's natural defenses--in particular, the defenses that prevent foreign mediums from invading the body.${prompt}

To maintain the transmogrified state, there must exist a continuous physiological reaction.${prompt};To put it in layman's terms...${prompt}
In other words, the Poroggo must keep sending inhibitor signals to the victim, or the reaction will cease.${prompt};To maintain the transmogrified state, there must exist a continuous physiological reaction.${prompt}
In theory, maintaining these signals would require extreme levels of concentration. This explains why most victims return to their original state after extended periods of time--when the caster becomes fatigued or distracted.${prompt};In other words, the Poroggo must keep sending inhibitor signals to the victim, or the reaction will cease.${prompt}
And if we apply these same conclusions, then we can easily explain why defeating the caster would immediately nullify the effects of the song.${prompt};In theory, maintaining these signals would require extreme levels of concentration. This explains why most victims return to their original state after extended periods of time--when the caster becomes fatigued or distracted.${prompt}
However, as we can see here, the victim, Mikilulu, remains in the transmogrified state despite the fact her assailant has met his demise.${prompt};And if we apply these same conclusions, then we can easily explain why defeating the caster would immediately nullify the effects of the song.${prompt}
Which suggests that she may not return with the simple passing of time.${prompt};However, as we can see here, the victim, Mikilulu, remains in the transmogrified state despite the fact her assailant has met his demise.${prompt}
Wh-what!? That can't be!${prompt};Which suggests that she may not return with the simple passing of time.${prompt}
The potency of the physiological reaction has been known to vary depending on mental condition of the victim. It is possible the song resonated with something deep within Mikilulu's subconscious.${prompt};Wh-what!? That can't be!${prompt}
Wait a minute... Are you trying to say that my girl has always been a frog!?${prompt};The potency of the physiological reaction has been known to vary depending on mental condition of the victim. It is possible the song resonated with something deep within Mikilulu's subconscious.${prompt}
While I wouldn't necessarily use those words, yes, one could say that your Mikilulu has more than likely been harboring suppressed ranine tendencies.${prompt};Wait a minute... Are you trying to say that my girl has always been a frog!?${prompt}
Though, there may be a more reasonable explanation.${prompt};While I wouldn't necessarily use those words, yes, one could say that your Mikilulu has more than likely been harboring suppressed ranine tendencies.${prompt}
For example, if a large portion of Mikilulu's conscious had been dedicated to thinking of, and or, worrying about toads, then her mind may have become dependant on the Poroggo's signal and thus began reproducing it out of necessity when the original signal stopped.${prompt};Though, there may be a more reasonable explanation.${prompt}

Your expression of love triggered something within Mikilulu's mind, or should I say heart, thus releasing her from the grasp of the inhibitor signals.${prompt};Let me sum up my theory for you.${prompt}
This ultimately proves that the duration of the frog song depends less on the potency of the Poroggo's cant, and more on the victim's psychological state.${prompt};Your expression of love triggered something within Mikilulu's mind, or should I say heart, thus releasing her from the grasp of the inhibitor signals.${prompt}
