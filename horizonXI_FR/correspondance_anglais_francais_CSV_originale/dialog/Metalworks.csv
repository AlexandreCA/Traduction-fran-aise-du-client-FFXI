Ah, but we can't do anything for you if you don't have a letter of introduction...${prompt};Oh, bonjour ! Bienvenue au Consulat de Windurst.
Oh! You have a letter of introduction!;Ah, mais nous ne pouvons rien faire pour vous si vous n'avez pas de lettre d'introduction...${prompt}
The consul would want to see you.;Oh ! Vous avez une lettre d'introduction !
He's in the back--go right on in.${prompt};Le consul voudra vous voir.
Oh, you're going to be fighting and all, aren't you?;Il est à l'arrière--allez-y directement.${prompt}
Be careful!${prompt};Oh ! Vous allez combattre et tout ça, n'est-ce pas ?
Oh! Good to see you again!;Soyez prudent !${prompt}
Are you going back to Windurst now?;Oh ! Content de vous revoir !
Tell everyone there we're doing fine!${prompt};Vous retournez à Windurst maintenant ?
Hello...?;Dites à tout le monde là-bas que nous allons bien !${prompt}
Yes, this is the Windurst Consulate.${prompt};Bonjour...?
A letter of introduction...?;Oui, c'est le Consulat de Windurst.${prompt}
Go talk to the consul, there.${prompt};Une lettre d'introduction...?
Going fighting...?;Allez parler au consul, là-bas.${prompt}
Good luck.${prompt};Vous allez combattre...?
Your mission's over...?;Bonne chance.${prompt}
Make it to Windurst safely.${prompt};Votre mission est terminée...?
An adventurer, in the Consulate of Jeuno?;Faites le chemin jusqu'à Windurst en toute sécurité.${prompt}
You have no business here.${prompt};Un aventurier, au Consulat de Jeuno ?
You are in the Consulate of Jeuno.;Vous n'avez rien à faire ici.${prompt}
We cannot do anything for you unless you are a citizen of Jeuno.${prompt};Vous êtes au Consulat de Jeuno.
This is the Consulate of Jeuno.;Nous ne pouvons rien faire pour vous à moins que vous ne soyez citoyen de Jeuno.${prompt}
There is nothing we can do for you unless you are a Jeunoan.${prompt};Ici, c'est le Consulat de Jeuno.
This is the Consulate of Jeuno.;Il n'y a rien que nous puissions faire pour vous à moins que vous ne soyez Jeunois.${prompt}
We can't do anything for you unless you have Jeunoan citizenship.${prompt};C'est le Consulat de Jeuno.
I am sorry, but I am a little busy at the moment.;Nous ne pouvons rien faire pour vous à moins que vous ne possédiez la citoyenneté Jeunoise.${prompt}
Would you mind coming back later?${prompt};Je suis désolé, mais je suis un peu occupé en ce moment.
This is the Presidential Aide's Office.;Pourriez-vous revenir plus tard ?${prompt}
Sir Lucius is quite busy at the moment--please try not to disturb him.${prompt};Vous êtes au Bureau de l'Assistant Présidentiel.
Yes, what is it you want with the Department of Industry?;Sir Lucius est très occupé pour le moment--essayez de ne pas le déranger, s'il vous plaît.${prompt}
We're very busy, you know. But we wouldn't be if the big boss wasn't such an ignorant amateur.${prompt};Oui, que voulez-vous avec le Département de l'Industrie ?
This is the Department of Industry.;Nous sommes très occupés, vous savez. Mais nous ne le serions pas si le grand patron n'était pas un amateur ignorant.${prompt}
Industry is what drives our nation, so our department essentially manages everything in Bastok.${prompt};Vous êtes au Département de l'Industrie.
Good senators like myself take time to listen to the pleas of the masses, unlike our young and inept president.${prompt};L'industrie est le moteur de notre nation, donc notre département gère essentiellement tout à Bastok.${prompt}
Heh-heh-heh. You are very kind, your lordship. You have given us so much... Heh-heh.${prompt};Les bons sénateurs comme moi prennent le temps d'écouter les requêtes des masses, contrairement à notre jeune et incompétent président.${prompt}
I must raise the Metalworks output before my term here ends.;Heh-heh-heh. Vous êtes très aimable, votre seigneurie. Vous nous avez tant donné... Heh-heh.${prompt}
I should start by raising everyone's daily quota...${prompt};Je dois augmenter la production des Fonderies avant la fin de mon mandat ici.
These managers they send us are all the same. They make us do all the work, and they take all the credit.${prompt};Je devrais commencer par augmenter le quota journalier de tout le monde...${prompt}
Did you see the big water wheels upstairs!?;Ces managers qu'ils nous envoient sont tous les mêmes. Ils nous font faire tout le travail, et ils en prennent tout le crédit.${prompt}
They're amazing! They send power to the entire Metalworks, you know?${prompt};Avez-vous vu les grandes roues à eau à l'étage !?
Tsk, tsk!;Elles sont incroyables ! Elles envoient de l'énergie à tout l'atelier, vous savez ?${prompt}
Engineers these days rely too much on machines!;Tsk, tsk !
Why, in my days...${prompt};Les ingénieurs de nos jours dépendent trop des machines !
Ka-chink! Ka-chink!;Eh bien, à mon époque...${prompt}
I just love the sound of hammers hitting metal!;Ka-chink ! Ka-chink !
I think it's even better than the songs that bards play!${prompt};J'adore le son des marteaux frappant le métal !
Have you ever met a feisty girl wearing a big scarf? She's the president's daughter, you know. No, I'm not kidding! I also hear they used to get along well until he came to his present post.${prompt};Je pense que c'est encore mieux que les chansons que jouent les bardes !${prompt}
Man, I need a break...${prompt};Avez-vous déjà rencontré une fille fougueuse portant une grande écharpe ? C'est la fille du président, vous savez. Non, je ne plaisante pas ! On dit aussi qu'ils s'entendaient bien avant qu'il n'accède à son poste actuel.${prompt}
I'm hungry...no, I mean, I'm starved.${prompt};Mec, j'ai besoin d'une pause...${prompt}
The food here isn't bad, but a little more variety wouldn't hurt, you know what I mean?${prompt};J'ai faim...non, je veux dire, je suis affamé.${prompt}
My friend, Offa, has been telling me that ${item-plural: 7[2]} are exquisite!;La nourriture ici n'est pas mauvaise, mais un peu plus de variété ne ferait pas de mal, vous voyez ce que je veux dire ?${prompt}
I wish I could have some, someday.${prompt};Mon ami, Offa, m'a dit que les ${item-plural: 7[2]} sont exquis !
He told me that there was an easy but dangerous way of making them, but--hey, speaking of Offa, he hasn't been coming to work lately...${prompt};J'aimerais en avoir un jour.${prompt}
Hmm, he's probably loafing around in his house in the Markets District again.${prompt};Il m'a dit qu'il y avait une manière facile mais dangereuse de les fabriquer, mais--hé, en parlant d'Offa, il n'est pas venu travailler récemment...${prompt}
Hey! Is that ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}?;Hmm, il traîne probablement chez lui dans le quartier des marchés encore une fois.${prompt}
Let me have it! Here, I'll give you this!${prompt};Hé ! Est-ce que c'est ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} ?
Whether it's mining, smithing, or adventuring, it's all the same.;Laisse-moi l'avoir ! Tiens, je te donne ça !${prompt}
We Galka do all the dirty work while the Humes sit back and watch.${prompt};Que ce soit la mine, la forge ou l'aventure, c'est toujours pareil.
This is the President's Office.${prompt};Nous, les Galka, faisons tout le sale boulot pendant que les Humes restent assis à regarder.${prompt}
Do you not have any missions to complete? If not, go get one and stop bothering me.${prompt};C'est le bureau du président.${prompt}
I'm sorry, kid, I'm a little busy right now.;Vous n'avez pas de missions à accomplir ? Si ce n'est pas le cas, allez en chercher une et arrêtez de me déranger.${prompt}
Come back later, hear?${prompt};Je suis désolé, mon gars, je suis un peu occupé en ce moment.
Ah, it's you.;Reviens plus tard, d'accord ?${prompt}
You remember what I asked you to do, right?${prompt};Ah, c'est toi.
Do not bother the chief.;Tu te souviens de ce que je t'ai demandé de faire, non ?${prompt}
Every second he spends away from his research is a loss to the Metalworks.${prompt};Ne dérangez pas le chef.
This is the President's Office.;Chaque seconde qu'il passe loin de ses recherches est une perte pour les Ateliers de Métal.${prompt}
Don't go in unless you got official business.${prompt};C'est le bureau du président.
How are you faring, adventurer?;N'entrez pas si vous n'avez pas d'affaires officielles.${prompt}
Remember, experience is the best teacher.${prompt};Comment vas-tu, aventurier ?
These cannons are nothing more than symbols now, and that is the way it should be.${prompt};N'oublie pas, l'expérience est le meilleur enseignant.${prompt}
These doors lead to the President's Office.;Ces canons ne sont plus que des symboles maintenant, et c'est ainsi que cela devrait être.${prompt}
Only those on special missions and high-ranking Bastokan adventurers may enter.${prompt};Ces portes mènent au bureau du président.
This is the Southern Cannonry.;Seuls ceux qui sont en mission spéciale et les aventuriers de haut rang de Bastok peuvent entrer.${prompt}
We can control all the cannons in Bastok from here.;C'est la Canonnière du Sud.
Hopefully, we won't need to any time soon.${prompt};Nous pouvons contrôler tous les canons de Bastok à partir d'ici.
Hey, you're not a kid. Why are you on the stamp hunt?;Espérons que nous n'en aurons pas besoin de sitôt.${prompt}
No, don't tell me, I don't want to know. Here.${prompt};Hé, tu n'es pas un gamin. Pourquoi es-tu à la chasse aux tampons ?
You received a stamp!${prompt};Non, ne me le dis pas, je ne veux pas le savoir. Tiens.${prompt}
This alcove is our Temple of the Goddess.;Vous avez reçu un tampon !${prompt}
Not many come here--Bastokers are not known for their piety.${prompt};Cette alcôve est notre Temple de la Déesse.
The stamp hunt? I do take exception to having people stomping into this sacred place, but...here, let us be done with it.${prompt};Peu de gens viennent ici - les habitants de Bastok ne sont pas réputés pour leur piété.${prompt}
This area is off-limits to...oh, you've brought the report from the Zeruhn Mines.;La chasse aux tampons ? Je prends exception à ce que les gens viennent piétiner ce lieu sacré, mais... bon, en fin de compte, en voilà un.${prompt}
I'll take that.${prompt};Cette zone est interdite aux... oh, vous avez apporté le rapport des Mines de Zeruhn.
This was your first mission, wasn't it? Good work.;Je vais prendre ça.${prompt}
Normally, we--${prompt};C'était votre première mission, n'est-ce pas ? Bon travail.
Sir Lucius! How may I help you?${prompt};Normalement, nous...${prompt}
Naji...you mentioned a report?${prompt};Monsieur Lucius ! Comment puis-je vous aider ?${prompt}
Yes, sir! This adventurer just brought the last one.;Naji... vous avez mentionné un rapport ?${prompt}
I was going to bring them all to you later, sir.${prompt};Oui, monsieur ! Cet aventurier vient juste d'apporter le dernier.
Show it to me.${prompt};Je comptais tous les apporter plus tard, monsieur.${prompt}
So...more and more Galka are starting to believe in their Talekeeper's return.${prompt};Montre-le moi.${prompt}
The Talekeeper, sir?;Alors... de plus en plus de Galka commencent à croire au retour de leur Gardien des Contes.${prompt}
But I thought that was just some Galka myth, sir.${prompt};Le Gardien des Contes, monsieur ?
If that were only true... I've received reports that the Talekeeper is already back among them.${prompt};Mais je pensais que c'était juste un mythe Galka, monsieur.${prompt}
These reports...keep bringing them to me, Naji.;Si seulement c'était vrai... J'ai reçu des rapports selon lesquels le Gardien des Contes est déjà de retour parmi eux.${prompt}
We would not want to bother the president with such trivial matters.${prompt};Ces rapports... continuez à me les apporter, Naji.
Yes, sir!${prompt};Nous ne voudrions pas déranger le président avec de telles trivialités.${prompt}
As for you, I know you have not been in Bastok long, so I will give you some advice.${prompt};Oui, monsieur !${prompt}
It is neither customary nor polite to open sealed documents prior to their delivery.;Quant à vous, je sais que vous n'êtes pas à Bastok depuis longtemps, alors je vais vous donner un conseil.${prompt}
Remember that if you wish to stay in Bastok.${prompt};Il n'est ni coutumier ni poli d'ouvrir des documents scellés avant leur livraison.
As for you, adventurer, you have done well.;Rappelez-vous-en si vous souhaitez rester à Bastok.${prompt}
Bastok needs more people like you.${prompt};Quant à vous, aventurier, vous avez bien fait.
Wow! Not many people get to speak to Sir Lucius after their first mission. He must see something in you. Keep up the good work!${prompt};Bastok a besoin de plus de gens comme vous.${prompt}
Yeah, what do you want?;Waouh ! Peu de gens ont l'occasion de parler à Monsieur Lucius après leur première mission. Il doit voir quelque chose en vous. Continuez ainsi !${prompt}
I'm a little busy right now.${prompt};Ouais, que veux-tu ?
Hmm? Yeah, I'm Cid.;Je suis un peu occupé en ce moment.${prompt}
Oh, you're here about the mission!;Hein ? Ouais, je suis Cid.
Right, I was expecting you.${prompt};Oh, tu es ici pour la mission !
Hey, Raibaht! Bring the thingamajig over here.${prompt};D'accord, je t'attendais.${prompt}
This is only your second mission, huh?;Hé, Raibaht ! Apporte le bidule par ici.${prompt}
Most of the young ones in Bastok don't have the guts to go adventuring, so I'm counting on you. Do your best, hear?${prompt};Ce n'est que ta deuxième mission, hein ?
Well, this mission's not all that tough.;La plupart des jeunes de Bastok n'ont pas le cran de partir à l'aventure, alors je compte sur toi. Fais de ton mieux, tu m'entends ?${prompt}
You just have to go out...${prompt};Eh bien, cette mission n'est pas si difficile.
...Raibaht, old buddy, if you brought the thing, don't just stand there, say something!${prompt};Tu dois juste sortir...${prompt}
...I brought the thing.${prompt};... Raibaht, mon vieux, si tu as apporté le truc, ne reste pas là sans rien dire !${prompt}
Gah!;... J’ai apporté le truc.${prompt}
If you don't quit that, I'm gonna start calling you “Silent Mountain” or something!${prompt};Gah !
You would not, Chief. You are not like the others.;"Si tu ne t'arrêtes pas, je vais commencer à t'appeler ""Montagne Silencieuse"" ou quelque chose comme ça !${prompt}"
That is why I work for you.${prompt};Tu ne le ferais pas, Chef. Tu n'es pas comme les autres.
Sheesh...;C'est pourquoi je travaille pour toi.${prompt}
I like the guy--he works hard, he's thorough in his research and all--but if only he was a little more talkative, you know?${prompt};Pff...
Anyway, here's what I want you to do. Take this ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} to the Dangruf Wadi near South Gustaberg.${prompt};J'aime bien ce gars – il bosse dur, il est méticuleux dans ses recherches et tout – mais s'il pouvait juste parler un peu plus, tu vois ?${prompt}
Try to find a place in the Wadi where this ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} changes color.;Quoi qu’il en soit, voici ce que je veux que tu fasses. Prends ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} au Wadi Dangruf près de Gustaberg sud.${prompt}
That's all.${prompt};Essaye de trouver un endroit dans le Wadi où ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} change de couleur.
What is it for? Well, in order for you to understand, I'd have to give you some lessons on the accrual patterns of sediments in the Wadi and the formation of gas pockets in the soil...${prompt};C'est tout.${prompt}
...You're getting a blank expression on your face. I know, I know, you didn't become an adventurer to study geology, right?;À quoi ça sert ? Eh bien, pour que tu comprennes, je devrais te donner des leçons sur les modèles d'accumulation de sédiments dans le Wadi et la formation de poches de gaz dans le sol...${prompt}
Don't worry, it's nothing dangerous, so get going!${prompt};...Tu as l'air perdu. Je sais, je sais, tu n'es pas devenu aventurier pour étudier la géologie, pas vrai ?
Ah, you're back!;Ne t'en fais pas, ce n'est rien de dangereux, alors en avant !${prompt}
Let's see it. Hmm...red, as I thought.;Ah, te voilà de retour !
And a very strong reaction, too.${prompt};Voyons voir ça. Hmm... rouge, comme je le pensais.
Then we should be able to use it...but we must make sure to minimize the ecological repercussions of such work...${prompt};Et une réaction très forte, en plus.${prompt}
Busy as always, Chief?${prompt};Alors nous devrions pouvoir l'utiliser... mais nous devons nous assurer de minimiser les répercussions écologiques d'un tel travail...${prompt}
Volker, you old dog!;Toujours aussi occupé, Chef ?${prompt}
When did you get back?${prompt};Volker, le vieux renard !
Just recently, sir. I had business in the Metalworks today, so I thought I'd drop by.${prompt};Depuis quand es-tu de retour ?${prompt}
You must have some great stories to tell!;Tout récemment, monsieur. J'avais des affaires dans la Fonderie aujourd'hui, alors je me suis dit que je passerais.${prompt}
Come on, out with them!${prompt};Tu dois avoir de super histoires à raconter !
Chief, were you not speaking to this person before I interrupted?${prompt};Allez, dis-nous tout !${prompt}
Oh, right! Sorry.;Chef, est-ce que vous ne parlais pas à cette personne avant que je n'interrompe ?${prompt}
It's been a long time since he and I had a chance to talk.${prompt};Oh, c'est vrai ! Désolé.
Let me introduce myself.;Cela fait longtemps que lui et moi n'avons pas eu l'occasion de parler.${prompt}
I am Volker, captain of the Mythril Musketeers.${prompt};Permettez-moi de me présenter.
You must be an adventurer...and new to Bastok too, are you not?;Je suis Volker, capitaine des Mousquetaires de Mythril.${prompt}
I hope you do well. Bastok is in need of good people.${prompt};Tu dois être un aventurier... et nouveau à Bastok aussi, n'est-ce pas ?
Yeah, for your second mission, you've done very well.;J'espère que tu te débrouilles bien. Bastok a besoin de bonnes personnes.${prompt}
I'll tell the guard at the gatehouse myself.${prompt};Oui, pour ta deuxième mission, tu t'es très bien débrouillé.
Well, I should be going.;Je parlerai moi-même au garde de la guérite.${prompt}
I will drop by again later, Chief.${prompt};Bon, je vais y aller.
I must go lend an ear to the president's gripes again.${prompt};Je repasserai plus tard, Chef.${prompt}
Come on, he needs support, especially from you.;Je dois encore prêter une oreille aux plaintes du président.${prompt}
It might not look like it, but I'm sure he's doing his best.${prompt};Allons, il a besoin de soutien, surtout de ta part.
I'm sorry to have kept you here so long. Thanks again, and good work.;Ça ne se voit peut-être pas, mais je suis sûr qu'il fait de son mieux.${prompt}
Oh, and I might need your help again soon, so stay in touch!${prompt};Désolé de t'avoir retenu aussi longtemps. Merci encore, et bon travail.
Ah, you've been assigned to investigate the ${item-plural: 7[2]}?${prompt};Oh, et j'aurai peut-être besoin de ton aide à nouveau bientôt, alors reste en contact !${prompt}
There are many strange phenomena associated with that place, as you've heard.${prompt};Ah, on t'a confié l’enquête sur les ${item-plural: 7[2]} ?${prompt}
I've scanned that area and I've found there is a strong crystal resonance on a straight line between that structure and Jeuno.${prompt};Il y a de nombreux phénomènes étranges associés à cet endroit, comme tu l'as entendu.${prompt}
For now, I'm calling it the “Crystal Line”...${prompt};J'ai balayé cette zone et j'ai découvert qu'il y a une forte résonance cristalline sur une ligne droite entre cette structure et Jeuno.${prompt}
Never mind, you're getting that blank expression on your face again. I'll skip the details.${prompt};"Pour l'instant, je l'appelle la ""Ligne Cristalline""...${prompt}"
There are three places near the structure where you can get ${item-plural: 7[2]}.;Peu importe, tu as encore cette expression vide sur ton visage. Je vais passer les détails.${prompt}
They're shining, raised platforms called “Telepoints.”${prompt};Il y a trois endroits près de la structure où tu peux obtenir ${item-plural: 7[2]}.
Place a crystal on a Telepoint, and the crystal will be drained of its power.;"Ce sont des plates-formes surélevées et brillantes appelées ""Télépoints"".${prompt}"
Do that, and bring back the faded crystal to me.${prompt};Place un cristal sur un Télépoint, et le cristal sera vidé de son énergie.
Oh, one more thing.;Fais cela, et ramène-moi le cristal éteint.${prompt}
To put the crystal on a Telepoint, use “Trade.”${prompt};Oh, une dernière chose.
Good, you've brought back ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.;"Pour placer le cristal sur un Télépoint, utilise ""Échanger"".${prompt}"
As I thought, its pattern of deterioration is almost identical to the one found in Beadeaux...${prompt};Bien, tu as ramené ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.
<Sigh>;Comme je le pensais, son motif de détérioration est presque identique à celui trouvé à Beadeaux...${prompt}
I just don't know what to make of all the strange occurrences that have been happening lately...${prompt};<Soupir>
I wonder if this has anything to do with the shattered Telepoint we discovered recently...${prompt};Je ne sais tout simplement pas quoi penser de tous les phénomènes étranges qui se produisent ces derniers temps...${prompt}
I wonder if this has anything to do with the shattered Telepoints...${prompt};Je me demande si cela a quelque chose à voir avec les Télépoints brisés que nous avons découverts récemment...${prompt}
Hm? Oh, sorry. Just talking to myself.;Je me demande si cela a quelque chose à voir avec les Télépoints brisés...${prompt}
Good job. You can...wait, can I ask you to do something else for me?${prompt};Hm ? Oh, désolé. Je parlais tout seul.
Do you remember Volker? He came here when you were reporting the results of your first mission to me.${prompt};Bon boulot. Tu peux... attends, est-ce que je peux te demander de faire quelque chose d'autre pour moi ?${prompt}
It would be best if you could deliver this to him personally, but he's a busy man and hard to find.${prompt};Do you remember Volker? He came here when you were reporting the results of your first mission to me.${prompt}
Give it to one of his Mythril Musketeers instead. Ayame and Naji should be on guard near the President's Office. Either one will do.${prompt};It would be best if you could deliver this to him personally, but he's a busy man and hard to find.${prompt}
A letter from the Chief?;Give it to one of his Mythril Musketeers instead. Ayame and Naji should be on guard near the President's Office. Either one will do.${prompt}
What is it about?${prompt};A letter from the Chief?
It's addressed to our captain.;What is it about?${prompt}
Let's see... Hmm? Huh? I can't make heads or tails out of this...${prompt};It's addressed to our captain.
I'm sorry, but could you give it to Ayame instead? She should be on guard at the rear of this building.;Let's see... Hmm? Huh? I can't make heads or tails out of this...${prompt}
This kind of technical stuff's more her specialty. It's all mumbo-jumbo to me.${prompt};I'm sorry, but could you give it to Ayame instead? She should be on guard at the rear of this building.
Oh, but do me a favor... Don't tell her I asked you to, or she's gonna make fun of me again.${prompt};This kind of technical stuff's more her specialty. It's all mumbo-jumbo to me.${prompt}
You have a letter from the Chief Engineer?;Oh, but do me a favor... Don't tell her I asked you to, or she's gonna make fun of me again.${prompt}
May I see it?${prompt};You have a letter from the Chief Engineer?
This is a report on the investigation of the Crystal Line.;May I see it?${prompt}
It is addressed to our captain... This might mean our company is moving out soon.${prompt};This is a report on the investigation of the Crystal Line.
Thank you for bringing this to me.;It is addressed to our captain... This might mean our company is moving out soon.${prompt}
Your presence is very much appreciated. The Chief is a little busy these days to do such chores himself.${prompt};Thank you for bringing this to me.
I must ask you one thing, though.;Your presence is very much appreciated. The Chief is a little busy these days to do such chores himself.${prompt}
Why did you bring this to me, and not Naji?;I must ask you one thing, though.
He is also a Mythril Musketeer, and posted closer to the entrance.${prompt};Why did you bring this to me, and not Naji?
Why did you bring the letter to Ayame?;He is also a Mythril Musketeer, and posted closer to the entrance.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Why did you bring the letter to Ayame?
Naji didn't look smart enough.;${selection-lines}
Ayame looked more reliable.;Naji didn't look smart enough.
Because I felt like it.${prompt};Ayame looked more reliable.
Hah hah hah.;Because I felt like it.${prompt}
Well, he is always saying, “I'm a fighter, not a thinker!”;Hah hah hah.
The latter, I may have to agree with.${prompt};Well, he is always saying, “I'm a fighter, not a thinker!”
Thank you for the compliment. Mythril Musketeers are supposed to be reliable, but I wasn't sure if I could fit the role. Well, at least I do a little bit more than Naji.${prompt};The latter, I may have to agree with.${prompt}
"You're very perceptive; I like that in an adventurer.";Thank you for the compliment. Mythril Musketeers are supposed to be reliable, but I wasn't sure if I could fit the role. Well, at least I do a little bit more than Naji.${prompt}
I guess I'll be seeing you around a lot more.${prompt};"You're very perceptive; I like that in an adventurer."
Oh. Well, no matter.;I guess I'll be seeing you around a lot more.${prompt}
Good work.${prompt};Oh. Well, no matter.
Oooh! You've brought me ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}!;Good work.${prompt}
I just love these cooked--${prompt};Oooh! You've brought me ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}!
Uh...I mean, this is very important to the safety of Bastok, yes!;I just love these cooked--${prompt}
It's imperative that you do not tell anyone you've brought this to me!${prompt};Uh...I mean, this is very important to the safety of Bastok, yes!
You have proven yourself to be a great patriot!;It's imperative that you do not tell anyone you've brought this to me!${prompt}
I will be following your career with great interest.${prompt};You have proven yourself to be a great patriot!
Senator, sir...you still haven't handed in your orders regarding--${prompt};I will be following your career with great interest.${prompt}
Iron Eater! Wh-what are you doing here!?;Senator, sir...you still haven't handed in your orders regarding--${prompt}
I am in the middle of a very important--${prompt};Iron Eater! Wh-what are you doing here!?
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 7[2]} again, sir?${prompt};I am in the middle of a very important--${prompt}
How did you know? Uh...I mean, get out!;${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 7[2]} again, sir?${prompt}
It's going to spoil if I don't cook it--${prompt};How did you know? Uh...I mean, get out!
<Sigh> Bon appetit, sir.;It's going to spoil if I don't cook it--${prompt}
Just hand in the papers to one of the Musketeers as soon as you're done.${prompt};<Sigh> Bon appetit, sir.
Tell me...do you not sometimes wonder if these missions are truly worth your time?${prompt};Just hand in the papers to one of the Musketeers as soon as you're done.${prompt}
Do you think missions are a waste of time?;Tell me...do you not sometimes wonder if these missions are truly worth your time?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Do you think missions are a waste of time?
Yes, I do.;${selection-lines}
No, I don't.${prompt};Yes, I do.
Hah hah hah.;No, I don't.${prompt}
You are an honest one. But it is not something you should say to a Mythril Musketeer, especially when you are near the President's Office.${prompt};Hah hah hah.
I see.;You are an honest one. But it is not something you should say to a Mythril Musketeer, especially when you are near the President's Office.${prompt}
I must apologize. It is unbecoming of a Mythril Musketeer to ask such questions.${prompt};I see.
Either way, there is no question that you have done a great deal for the prosperity of Bastok, and that you will in the future as well.${prompt};I must apologize. It is unbecoming of a Mythril Musketeer to ask such questions.${prompt}
I must try to do the same...${prompt};Either way, there is no question that you have done a great deal for the prosperity of Bastok, and that you will in the future as well.${prompt}
Good to see you again.;I must try to do the same...${prompt}
I hear you're going overseas.${prompt};Good to see you again.
Usually, I would be giving you your orders, but this time, the president's aide wants to meet with you in person.${prompt};I hear you're going overseas.${prompt}
I don't know if the missions you've been on so far were tough for you...${prompt};Usually, I would be giving you your orders, but this time, the president's aide wants to meet with you in person.${prompt}
But this time, I'm sure it's going to be a real challenge.${prompt};I don't know if the missions you've been on so far were tough for you...${prompt}
I mean, you're going to have to go to both San d'Oria and Windurst...${prompt};But this time, I'm sure it's going to be a real challenge.${prompt}
It's not like going somewhere nearby, like Gustaberg or the Konschtat Highlands.;I mean, you're going to have to go to both San d'Oria and Windurst...${prompt}

Ah, you're here on a mission, aren't you?;Le président, malgré ses paroles dures, vous estime beaucoup et s'attend à ce que vous réussissiez. Tout comme moi.${prompt}
We've been expecting you.;Ah, vous êtes ici pour une mission, n'est-ce pas ?
It's good to see you made it here safely.${prompt};Nous vous attendions.
Riault, if you please.${prompt};C'est bon de vous voir arriver ici sain et sauf.${prompt}
Yes, ma'am.;Riault, s'il vous plaît.${prompt}
First, let me tell you about Bastok's current state.${prompt};Oui, madame.
Bastok has already lost several major assets to the Quadav.;Tout d'abord, laissez-moi vous parler de l'état actuel de Bastok.${prompt}
The Palborough Mines were the greatest loss.${prompt};Bastok a déjà perdu plusieurs atouts majeurs face aux Quadavs.
Their recent plight is akin to ours in our fight against the Orcs.;Les mines de Palborough ont été la perte la plus importante.${prompt}
Only in the time prior to the Great War did the power balance shift so.${prompt};Leur situation récente est similaire à la nôtre dans notre lutte contre les Orcs.
I've heard a rumor that they are rallying behind a new leader!;Seule l'époque précédant la Grande Guerre a vu un tel changement de pouvoir.${prompt}
Can you believe it? Beastmen, being organized!?${prompt};J'ai entendu une rumeur selon laquelle ils se rallieraient derrière un nouveau leader !
This bodes ill, I tell you.;Pouvez-vous le croire ? Des bêtes organisées !?${prompt}
What's worse, we are stuck here in this city of uncouth ruffians!${prompt};Cela présage mal, je vous le dis.
Chantain! That is enough.;Et ce qui est pire, c'est que nous sommes coincés ici dans cette ville de voyous incultes !${prompt}
Riault, please continue.${prompt};Chantain ! Cela suffit.
Your mission is to go to the Palborough Mines, currently under Quadav control, and take a sample of the dwindling resource called mythril.${prompt};Riault, veuillez continuer.${prompt}
To be precise, we need you to bring back ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt};Votre mission est d'aller aux mines de Palborough, actuellement sous le contrôle des Quadavs, et de prendre un échantillon de la ressource décroissante appelée mythril.${prompt}
Thanks to our agreement to mutual cooperation, Bastok is allowing us to send you into the mines. Your true objective is to gather as much information as possible on Bastok's advanced technology.${prompt};Pour être précis, nous avons besoin que vous rameniez ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}
We need to find out who or what is rallying the beastmen, and at the same time make it look like we are cooperating with Bastok.${prompt};Grâce à notre accord de coopération mutuelle, Bastok nous permet de vous envoyer dans les mines. Votre véritable objectif est de recueillir autant d'informations que possible sur la technologie avancée de Bastok.${prompt}
That is why we need you to go investigate the Palborough Mines. They were once the property of Bastok...but these days, no sane Bastoker would come within a malm of it, given the choice.${prompt};Nous devons découvrir qui ou quoi rassemble les bêtes, tout en donnant l'impression que nous coopérons avec Bastok.${prompt}
If it were up to us, we would want you to go to the mines right away, but we were told by the Bastok authorities that you must report to them first in order to receive authorization.${prompt};C'est pourquoi nous avons besoin que vous alliez enquêter sur les mines de Palborough. Elles étaient autrefois la propriété de Bastok... mais de nos jours, aucun Bastokien sensé ne s'approcherait à moins d'un malm de là, s'il avait le choix.${prompt}
I know you'd rather do without all the red tape, but bear with us and report to the Bastokan official named Pius. He can be found in the President's Office.${prompt};Si cela dépendait de nous, nous voudrions que vous alliez aux mines immédiatement, mais les autorités de Bastok nous ont dit que vous deviez d'abord vous rendre auprès d'eux pour obtenir une autorisation.${prompt}
I must warn you that we thought the Humes were a reasonable people before we came here...but we've found that this is not always the case.${prompt};Je sais que vous préféreriez vous passer de toute cette paperasserie, mais supportez-nous et rendez-vous auprès du responsable de Bastok nommé Pius. Vous le trouverez dans le bureau du président.${prompt}
Their talent at making profit is incomparable, but their sense of duty is somewhat lacking.;Je dois vous avertir que nous pensions que les Humes étaient un peuple raisonnable avant de venir ici... mais nous avons découvert que ce n'est pas toujours le cas.${prompt}
In fact, even their officials can be troublesome. For the sake of your mission's success, try to be patient.${prompt};Leur talent pour faire des profits est incomparable, mais leur sens du devoir laisse quelque peu à désirer.
Ah, you've brought the ${item-singular: 7[2]}.;En fait, même leurs fonctionnaires peuvent poser problème. Pour le succès de votre mission, essayez d'être patient.${prompt}
Good work.${prompt};Ah, vous avez apporté le ${item-singular: 7[2]}.
I will have Riault make a brief of the information we've been able to assemble on Bastokan technology.;Bon travail.${prompt}
Riault, if you please.${prompt};Je vais demander à Riault de rédiger un résumé des informations que nous avons pu rassembler sur la technologie bastokienne.
Ah, you have returned. What did you find?;Riault, s'il vous plaît.${prompt}
Hmm...I see. I am glad you made it back safely.${prompt};Ah, vous êtes revenu. Qu'avez-vous trouvé ?
Riault will write down the details of your investigation.;Hmm... je vois. Je suis content que vous soyez revenu sain et sauf.${prompt}
Please tell him what you have seen.${prompt};Riault prendra note des détails de votre enquête.
<Sigh>;Veuillez lui dire ce que vous avez vu.${prompt}
Oh, when will we be allowed to go back to San d'Oria, I wonder.${prompt};<Soupire>
I've had it up to here with these crass Humes and savage Galka.;Quand pourrons-nous revenir à San d'Oria, je me demande.${prompt}
I want out!${prompt};J'en ai assez de ces Humes grossiers et de ces Galka sauvages.
I know what you mean.;Je veux partir !${prompt}
Even their architectural techniques are crude. It's a wonder these buildings are still standing!${prompt};Je comprends ce que tu veux dire.
Might I remind you two that this “crude and savage” nation is rivaling San d'Oria for power on this continent?${prompt};Même leurs techniques architecturales sont rudimentaires. C'est un miracle que ces bâtiments tiennent encore debout !${prompt}
San d'Oria can ill afford to sit back on its past glories. Our complacence and arrogance will be our downfall.${prompt};"Ne devrais-je pas vous rappeler que cette nation ""grossière et sauvage"" rivalise avec San d'Oria pour le pouvoir sur ce continent ?${prompt}"
Wasn't it that kind of talk that got you sent here in the first place, regardless of the fact that you are of noble blood?${prompt};San d'Oria ne peut guère se permettre de se reposer sur ses gloires passées. Notre complaisance et notre arrogance seront notre perte.${prompt}
Yes, you should be careful. As my grandfather used to say, “If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.”${prompt};N'était-ce pas ce genre de discours qui vous a envoyé ici en premier lieu, peu importe que vous soyez de noble lignée ?${prompt}
Oh, you should talk, Chantain.;"Oui, vous devriez faire attention. Comme disait mon grand-père, ""Si tu n'as rien de gentil à dire, ne dis rien du tout.""${prompt}"
Riault, isn't it about time you were done?${prompt};Oh, tu devrais parler, Chantain.
All done, ma'am.;Riault, n'est-il pas temps que tu aies fini ?${prompt}
This concludes the Bastok part of this mission.${prompt};Tout est terminé, madame.
You are going to Windurst next, aren't you?;Cela conclut la partie concernant Bastok de cette mission.${prompt}
Do as you have done here. Head to the consulate, and they will take care of you.${prompt};Vous vous rendez ensuite à Windurst, n'est-ce pas ?
Glory be to San d'Oria, and may you walk with honor.${prompt};Faites comme vous avez fait ici. Rendez-vous au consulat, et ils s'occuperont de vous.${prompt}
Your mission is almost complete.;Gloire à San d'Oria, et que vous marchiez avec honneur.${prompt}
You have only to return to San d'Oria with your report.${prompt};Votre mission est presque terminée.
Oh, you're the adventurer with the letter of introduction, yes?${prompt};Il vous suffit de retourner à San d'Oria avec votre rapport.${prompt}
It's good of you to come.;Oh, vous êtes l'aventurier avec la lettre d'introduction, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
It must've been a long journey, riding a boat to a faraway place like this.${prompt};C'est bien de votre part d'être venu.
I studied hard to become a consul, hoping I'd be waited on by cutesy-wutesy secretaries, but my fate was to be delegated to this neck of the woods...${prompt};Ça a dû être un long voyage, monter sur un bateau pour un endroit lointain comme celui-ci.${prompt}
Oh! I'm sorry-worry!;J'ai étudié dur pour devenir consul, espérant être servi par des secrétaires mignonnes, mais mon destin a été d'être délégué dans ce coin perdu...${prompt}
Don't tell anyone I said that, please?${prompt};Oh ! Je suis désolé !
I mean, you can't blame me--I'm surrounded by musky Humes and scary Galka instead of cutesy...uh, you know.${prompt};Ne dites à personne que j'ai dit ça, s'il vous plaît ?${prompt}
Oh, Mih Ketto?;Je veux dire, vous ne pouvez pas me blâmer - je suis entouré de Humes musclés et de Galkas effrayants au lieu de mignon... vous savez.${prompt}
We have a guest here. Shouldn't you be serving tea?${prompt};Oh, Mih Ketto ?
What tea? We ran out of tea months ago!${prompt};Nous avons un invité ici. Ne devrais-tu pas servir du thé ?${prompt}
Then why haven't you refilled our stock?;Quel thé ? Nous sommes à court de thé depuis des mois !${prompt}
How many times have I told you...${prompt};Alors pourquoi n'avez-vous pas rempli notre stock ?
Uh...sir?;Combien de fois je vous l'ai dit...${prompt}
Would you like me to go out and buy some?${prompt};Uh... monsieur ?
Hmm, well...;Voulez-vous que j'aille en acheter ?${prompt}
Now that you mention it, I don't remember seeing anyone selling tea here...${prompt};Hmm, eh bien...
Hmm? You don't care about tea, you say? You want to hear about the mission? Oh, bother...${prompt};Maintenant que vous en parlez, je ne me rappelle pas avoir vu quelqu'un vendre du thé ici...${prompt}
I'm sorry, as greasing people's...I mean, trying to make people happy-snappy has become a habit. It's part of the job.${prompt};Hmm ? Vous vous moquez du thé, dites-vous ? Vous voulez entendre parler de la mission ? Oh, zut...${prompt}
Anyway, here's what you have to do...;Je suis désolé, faire plaisir aux gens... Je veux dire, essayer de rendre les gens heureux, est devenu une habitude. Cela fait partie du travail.${prompt}
Uh... That is... Let's see...${prompt};Anyway, here's what you have to do...
Topuru-Kuperu! What was it we were supposed to ask?${prompt};Uh... That is... Let's see...${prompt}
Huh? What?;Topuru-Kuperu! What was it we were supposed to ask?${prompt}
Did you call me, sir?${prompt};Huh? What?
Oh! There you are!;Did you call me, sir?${prompt}
You were making yourself so small I didn't see you!${prompt};Oh! There you are!
The mission, man, the mission!;You were making yourself so small I didn't see you!${prompt}
You know, for the adventurer from Windurst!${prompt};The mission, man, the mission!
I know how homesick you are, but I expect you to do your share while you're here!${prompt};You know, for the adventurer from Windurst!${prompt}
Uh...I think it had...something to do with going to the Palborough Mines, sir...${prompt};I know how homesick you are, but I expect you to do your share while you're here!${prompt}
Oh...I remember now.;Uh...I think it had...something to do with going to the Palborough Mines, sir...${prompt}
We need some refined ore.${prompt};Oh...I remember now.
What? Is that really something we should be asking a great adventurer from Windurst to do?;We need some refined ore.${prompt}
And the Palborough Mines are infested with Quadav, too!${prompt};What? Is that really something we should be asking a great adventurer from Windurst to do?
Beg your pardon, sir, but...I think it's our pretext for studying Bastokan technology, sir...${prompt};And the Palborough Mines are infested with Quadav, too!${prompt}
Oh, I remember now. The Quadav are acting strangely, so the adventurer is to go to the Palborough Mines to investigate.${prompt};Beg your pardon, sir, but...I think it's our pretext for studying Bastokan technology, sir...${prompt}
That's very-wary vague... And aren't the Palborough Mines overrun by the Quadav?;Oh, I remember now. The Quadav are acting strangely, so the adventurer is to go to the Palborough Mines to investigate.${prompt}
Isn't that dangerous?${prompt};That's very-wary vague... And aren't the Palborough Mines overrun by the Quadav?
Well, reports from Windurst say that beastmen of different types all seem to be exhibiting the same type of organized behavior... That is what we need to investigate, sir.${prompt};Isn't that dangerous?${prompt}
But first, the adventurer is to meet with Sir Pius in the President's Office...${prompt};Well, reports from Windurst say that beastmen of different types all seem to be exhibiting the same type of organized behavior... That is what we need to investigate, sir.${prompt}
Ah, yes! Pius--Sir Pius. I think we've had dinner once...or perhaps it was brunch?${prompt};But first, the adventurer is to meet with Sir Pius in the President's Office...${prompt}
No matter. To work, then!;Ah, yes! Pius--Sir Pius. I think we've had dinner once...or perhaps it was brunch?${prompt}
Good luck! Come back when you're done!${prompt};No matter. To work, then!
Ah, ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}!;Good luck! Come back when you're done!${prompt}
Good job! Good job!;Ah, ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}!
Tell Topuru-Kuperu what you've seen.${prompt};Good job! Good job!
We'll return this ${item-singular: 7[2]} to the government of Bastok after we've studied it.${prompt};Tell Topuru-Kuperu what you've seen.${prompt}
So you were able to enter a beastman-infested area, perform your mission, and still manage to come back in one piece. Extaruordinary!;We'll return this ${item-singular: 7[2]} to the government of Bastok after we've studied it.${prompt}
Don't you think so, Topuru-Kuperu?${prompt};So you were able to enter a beastman-infested area, perform your mission, and still manage to come back in one piece. Extaruordinary!
Ah, welcome back!;Don't you think so, Topuru-Kuperu?${prompt}

Topuru-Kuperu will write down your report.;I see you're still in one piece!${prompt}
Tell him what you've seen!${prompt};Topuru-Kuperu will write down your report.
Oh, my! Is that true!?;Tell him what you've seen!${prompt}
Oh, my! Oh, my!${prompt};Oh, my! Is that true!?
It's simply amazing that you could run into such a monster, and not be pounded into adventurer soup!;Oh, my! Oh, my!${prompt}
Don't you think so, Topuru-Kuperu?${prompt};It's simply amazing that you could run into such a monster, and not be pounded into adventurer soup!
What?;Don't you think so, Topuru-Kuperu?${prompt}
Oh, right. I guess so, sir.${prompt};What?
Oh, let me guess--you were thinking about Windurst again, weren't you?;Oh, right. I guess so, sir.${prompt}
Snap out of it, man! You have work to do!${prompt};Oh, let me guess--you were thinking about Windurst again, weren't you?
<Sigh> Windurst...${prompt};Snap out of it, man! You have work to do!${prompt}
Well, you can't say I didn't try.;<Sigh> Windurst...${prompt}
Ah--but you will report that all of us are working exceptionally hard here, yes?${prompt};Well, you can't say I didn't try.
You're off to San d'Oria now, aren't you?;Ah--but you will report that all of us are working exceptionally hard here, yes?${prompt}
Have a safe and pleasant trip!${prompt};You're off to San d'Oria now, aren't you?
Since you've visited both San d'Oria and Bastok, you may now make your triumphant return to Windurst!;Have a safe and pleasant trip!${prompt}
Oh, and tell everyone we said hi!${prompt};Since you've visited both San d'Oria and Bastok, you may now make your triumphant return to Windurst!
Yes, what is it?;Oh, and tell everyone we said hi!${prompt}
Ah, you are the envoy from ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Windurst].${prompt};Oui, que puis-je faire pour vous ?
Go speak to a Galka named Grohm--he was part of the expedition that tried to reclaim the Palborough Mines from the Quadav once before.;Ah, vous êtes l'envoyé de ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Windurst].${prompt}
He should be in the Craftsmen's Eatery in the Metalworks.${prompt};Allez parler à un Galka nommé Grohm - il faisait partie de l'expédition qui a tenté de reprendre les Mines de Palborough aux Quadav par le passé.
Why are you still here?;Il devrait être dans le Craftsmen's Eatery dans le Metalworks.${prompt}
The Musketeers are usually charged with giving out missions, and frankly, I find this kind of work tedious...${prompt};Pourquoi êtes-vous toujours là ?
But since you are an envoy, you are under my jurisdiction.;Les Mousquetaires sont généralement chargés de donner des missions, et franchement, je trouve ce genre de travail fastidieux...${prompt}
Still, I can't help but wonder what you ${choice: 0}[San d'Orians/Windurstians]' true motives are...${prompt};Mais étant donné que vous êtes un envoyé, vous êtes sous ma juridiction.
Then again, you're going willingly into that Quadav-ridden place, so I can't complain, even if you do turn out to be a spy.${prompt};Néanmoins, je ne peux m'empêcher de me demander quels sont les véritables motivations des ${choice: 0}[San d'Oriens/Windurstiens]...${prompt}
Well, anyway... You want to speak to Grohm, in the Metalworks eatery.;Puis encore, vous vous rendez volontairement dans cet endroit infesté de Quadav, alors je ne peux pas me plaindre, même si vous vous avérez être un espion.${prompt}
Good luck to you.${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit... Vous voulez parler à Grohm, dans le Craftsmen's Eatery du Metalworks.
Oh, and when you're done with your investigation, report directly to your consulate.;Bonne chance.${prompt}
That is our protocol. I would be rather annoyed if you were to come back here.${prompt};Oh, et lorsque vous aurez terminé votre enquête, rapportez directement à votre consulat.
Hm? What do you want?;C'est notre protocole. Je serais plutôt contrarié si vous reveniez ici.${prompt}
Hey, you're not from Bastok, are you?${prompt};Hm ? Que voulez-vous ?
What!? You're ${choice: 0}[San d'Orian/Windurstian], and you listened to what a Bastokan official told you to do?${prompt};Hé, vous n'êtes pas de Bastok, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Hah! I have no idea why that Hume sent you here...or why your consulate sent you to him in the first place.${prompt};Quoi !? Vous êtes ${choice: 0}[San d’Orien/Windurstien], et vous avez écouté ce qu’un officiel de Bastok vous a dit de faire ?${prompt}
You better listen good. A lot of us died trying to win the Palborough Mines back from the Quadav...${prompt};Hah ! Je ne sais pas pourquoi ce Hume vous a envoyé ici... ou pourquoi votre consulat vous a envoyé chez lui en premier lieu.${prompt}
It might not matter to a foreigner like you, but they always send us Galka to do the dirty work!${prompt};Vous feriez mieux d'écouter attentivement. Beaucoup d'entre nous sont morts en essayant de reprendre les Mines de Palborough aux Quadav...${prompt}
What gets me the most is that they don't even think about it twice!;Cela pourrait ne pas importuner un étranger comme vous, mais ils nous envoient toujours, nous les Galka, faire le sale boulot !${prompt}
Even if you haven't been here long, you must've seen how they treat us.${prompt};Ce qui m'agace le plus, c'est qu'ils n'y réfléchissent même pas à deux fois !
Never mind. Shouting at you won't change anything.;Même si vous n'êtes pas ici depuis longtemps, vous avez dû voir comment ils nous traitent.${prompt}
You wanted to know about refining ore, right? It's easy, but you have to remember the steps.${prompt};Peu importe. Vous crier dessus ne changera rien.
Here goes:;Vous vouliez savoir comment raffiner le minerai, n'est-ce pas ? C'est simple, mais vous devez vous souvenir des étapes.${prompt}
1. Get ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}.;Voici comment faire :
2. Put that into the upper part of the refiner.;1. Obtenez ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}.
3. Take the ${item-singular: 7[2]} out of the lower part of the refiner.${prompt};2. Mettez-le dans la partie supérieure du raffineur.
You can either buy ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} from someone, or get some by using ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]} on a mythril seam inside Palborough.${prompt};3. Retirez ${article} ${item-singular: 7[2]} de la partie inférieure du raffineur.${prompt}
The refining machine is so big, its upper and lower sections are on different floors.;Vous pouvez soit acheter ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} à quelqu’un, soit en obtenir en utilisant ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]} sur une veine de mythril à l’intérieur de Palborough.${prompt}
Put ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} into it on the third floor, and it'll produce ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} on the second floor.${prompt};La machine de raffinage est si grande que ses parties supérieure et inférieure se trouvent à différents étages.
I know it sounds simple, but it's not. You've got the Quadav to deal with, and they're everywhere.${prompt};Mettez ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} dedans au troisième étage, et elle produira ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} au deuxième étage.${prompt}
Here, take these ${item-plural: 5[2]}.;Je sais que ça a l'air simple, mais ce n'est pas le cas. Vous avez les Quadav à gérer, et ils sont partout.${prompt}
Good luck. You're gonna need it.${prompt};Tiens, prends ces ${item-plural: 5[2]}.
Hey, you're an adventurer, right? From another country?${prompt};Bonne chance. Vous en aurez besoin.${prompt}
Sorry, I couldn't help but eavesdrop.;Hé, vous êtes un aventurier, non ? D'un autre pays ?${prompt}
I'm going to the Palborough Mines, too.${prompt};Désolé, je n'ai pas pu m'empêcher d'écouter aux portes.
Don't worry, I won't get in your way.;Je vais aussi aux Mines de Palborough.${prompt}
I don't think we're going after the same thing anyway.${prompt};Ne t'inquiète pas, je ne vais pas te gêner.
At least, for now.${prompt};Je ne pense pas que nous recherchons la même chose de toute façon.${prompt}
But you shouldn't think your mission is just a mine survey.${prompt};Du moins, pour l'instant.${prompt}
The beastmen seem to have found a new leader, and the Quadav are getting more powerful with each passing day. There could be another war...${prompt};Mais tu ne devrais pas penser que ta mission se résume à une simple étude de mine.${prompt}
Oh, there's one thing you should know. Do you know why the Quadav took the Palborough Mines?${prompt};Les bêtes semblent avoir trouvé un nouveau leader, et les Quadav deviennent plus puissants de jour en jour. Il pourrait y avoir une autre guerre...${prompt}
Humes claim that the Quadav stole the mines from them, but in reality, the mines are the Quadav's home...no, their holy land.${prompt};Oh, il y a une chose que tu devrais savoir. Sais-tu pourquoi les Quadav ont pris les Mines de Palborough ?${prompt}
The Quadav would die rather than lose it. But the Humes in Bastok don't know, and they don't care to know.${prompt};Les Humes prétendent que les Quadav leur ont volé les mines, mais en réalité, les mines sont le foyer des Quadav... non, leur terre sainte.${prompt}
Well, it's time for me to go. Oh, and my name is Lion. I'm an adventurer, like you. I'll be seeing you around.${prompt};Les Quadav préféreraient mourir plutôt que de la perdre. Mais les Humes de Bastok ne le savent pas, et ils ne veulent pas  le savoir.${prompt}
Never mind, shouting at you won't change anything.;Eh bien, il est temps pour moi d'y aller. Oh, et mon nom est Lion. Je suis un aventurier, comme toi. On se reverra.${prompt}
You wanted to know about the beastmen, right?${prompt};Peu importe, te crier dessus ne changera rien.
I've heard rumors that those dumb Quadav are acting organized.${prompt};Tu voulais en savoir plus sur les bêtes, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
There's even talk that they have a leader now, like in the Great War...${prompt};J'ai entendu des rumeurs selon lesquelles ces Quadav stupides agissent de manière organisée.${prompt}
Oh, and there's a strange magic circle at the deepest end of the Palborough Mines. It's said that whoever goes beyond it never comes back.${prompt};On dit même qu'ils ont un chef maintenant, comme pendant la Grande Guerre...${prompt}
Sounds real suspicious, doesn't it?;Oh, et il y a un étrange cercle magique au fond des Mines de Palborough. On dit que quiconque le franchit ne revient jamais.${prompt}
I'm sure you'll find your answers there.${prompt};Ça sonne vraiment suspect, n'est-ce pas ?
Me? Oh, no. I'm never going back there.;Je suis sûr que tu trouveras tes réponses là-bas.${prompt}
Good luck. You're gonna need it!${prompt};Moi ? Oh non. Je n'y retournerai jamais.
Ah, you must be the adventurer who is to join us on our mission. I have heard much about you.${prompt};Bonne chance. Tu en auras besoin !${prompt}
We would like to hold a briefing soon. You will be allowed time to prepare for the mission afterwards, but the briefing might take a bit of time. Are you ready now?${prompt};Ah, tu dois être l'aventurier qui va nous rejoindre pour notre mission. J'ai beaucoup entendu parler de toi.${prompt}
When would you like to be briefed?;Nous aimerions tenir un briefing bientôt. Vous aurez le temps de vous préparer pour la mission par la suite, mais le briefing pourrait prendre un peu de temps. Êtes-vous prêt maintenant ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Quand souhaitez-vous être informé ?
Right away.;${selection-lines}
Later.${prompt};Tout de suite.
Good. Come with me.${prompt};Plus tard.${prompt}
Hold, Milady!;Bien. Suivez-moi.${prompt}
Where are you going!?${prompt};Attendez, Milady !
Oh, hi!;Où allez-vous ?${prompt}
Don't mind me, I'm just going to the Mines District!${prompt};Oh, salut !
Again? We Mythril Musketeers cannot chaperone you every time you decide to go on these excursions...${prompt};Ne faites pas attention à moi, je vais juste au district des mines !${prompt}
I know, that's why I'm going by myself! Don't worry, I'll be fine!;Encore ? Nous, les Mousquetaires du Mythril, ne pouvons pas vous escorter à chaque fois que vous décidez de partir en excursion...${prompt}
Bye!${prompt};Je sais, c'est pourquoi j'y vais seule ! Ne vous inquiétez pas, je serai bien !
No, wait--;Au revoir !${prompt}
Drat!${prompt};Non, attends --
Hey, where's she going?${prompt};Zut !${prompt}
“Where's she going”!?;Hé, où va-t-elle ?${prompt}
You, sir, were stationed to stop her!${prompt};"""Où va-t-elle"" !?"
But...but...${prompt};Vous, Monsieur, étiez chargé de l'arrêter !${prompt}
No talking back to senior Musketeers, Naji--or should I call you, “Number Five”?${prompt};Mais... mais...${prompt}
Urgh...${prompt};"Pas de réplique aux Mousquetaires seniors, Naji -- ou devrais-je vous appeler ""Numéro Cinq"" ?${prompt}"
Come on, get in!${prompt};Urgh...${prompt}
Thank you all for coming on such short notice.;Allez, montez !${prompt}
Here is your mission: You are to mount an assault on the Quadav stronghold in Beadeaux.${prompt};Merci à tous d'être venus si rapidement.
Be forewarned that this is only to be a limited strike.;Voici votre mission : Vous devez monter une attaque sur le bastion Quadav à Beadeaux.${prompt}
Your main objectives are to coordinate tactics with experienced adventurers, and to familiarize yourselves with the local terrain.${prompt};Soyez prévenus que cela ne sera qu'une frappe limitée.
As you see, some of our good adventuring friends have agreed to join the Musketeers on this operation.${prompt};Vos principaux objectifs sont de coordonner les tactiques avec des aventuriers expérimentés et de vous familiariser avec le terrain local.${prompt}
Number Four, Ayame, planned this operation, so she will be in charge.${prompt};Comme vous pouvez le constater, certains de nos bons amis aventuriers ont accepté de se joindre aux Mousquetaires pour cette opération.${prompt}

Ayame, if you please?${prompt};Vous devez tous suivre leurs ordres pendant l'opération.
First, we are to rendezvous in Beadeaux, near the entrance to the Quadav stronghold.;Ayame, je vous prie ?${prompt}
Your targets are the Copper Quadav in charge of perimeter defense.${prompt};Tout d'abord, nous devons nous retrouver à Beadeaux, près de l'entrée du bastion Quadav.
Each of you are to defeat twenty Copper Quadav.;Vos cibles sont les Quadav de cuivre en charge de la défense périmétrique.${prompt}
Once you have accomplished this objective, you are to disperse and retreat, then regroup at the entrance once again.${prompt};Chacun de vous doit vaincre vingt Quadav de cuivre.
Don't forget, the rendezvous point is right inside Beadeaux!;Une fois cet objectif accompli, vous devez vous disperser et battre en retraite, puis vous regrouper à nouveau à l'entrée.${prompt}
Nobody get lost, now!${prompt};N'oubliez pas, le point de rendez-vous est juste à l'intérieur de Beadeaux !
You should talk. You'd even get lost in your own Mog House.${prompt};Personne ne se perdra, d'accord ?${prompt}
Once you are prepared, waste no time going to the rendezvous point.;Tu ferais mieux de te taire. Tu te perdrais même dans ta propre Maison Mog.${prompt}
Dismissed.${prompt};Dès que vous êtes prêts, ne perdez pas de temps pour vous rendre au point de rendez-vous.
The way to the rendezvous point is through the Pashhow Marshlands. It is right inside Beadeaux.${prompt};Renvoyés.${prompt}
Walk across the Pashhow Marshlands to get to the rendezvous point.;Le chemin vers le point de rendez-vous passe par les marais de Pashhow. Il est juste à l'intérieur de Beadeaux.${prompt}
It's right inside Beadeaux. Make sure to bring everything you'll need!${prompt};Traversez les marais de Pashhow pour atteindre le point de rendez-vous.
The rendezvous point is across the Pashhow Marshlands, and right inside Beadeaux.;C'est juste à l'intérieur de Beadeaux. Assurez-vous d'avoir tout ce dont vous avez besoin !${prompt}
Be prepared for anything.${prompt};Le point de rendez-vous est à travers les marais de Pashhow, et juste à l'intérieur de Beadeaux.
Ah, you are here. Good.${prompt};Soyez prêts à tout.${prompt}
You must have heard this already, but we need someone reliable to take on missions centered around our embassy in Jeuno.${prompt};Ah, vous êtes là. Bien.${prompt}
I've talked to both the president and Captain Volker, and it is our unanimous opinion that you are the only person adequate for the task.${prompt};Vous avez sûrement déjà entendu cela, mais nous avons besoin de quelqu'un de fiable pour prendre en charge les missions centrées autour de notre ambassade à Jeuno.${prompt}
We will give you a letter of introduction, which you will present at our embassy in Jeuno to receive further instructions.${prompt};J'ai parlé tant au président qu'au Capitaine Volker, et c'est notre avis unanime que vous êtes la seule personne adéquate pour la tâche.${prompt}
Hans, the letter.${prompt};Nous vous remettrons une lettre d'introduction, que vous présenterez à notre ambassade à Jeuno pour recevoir de plus amples instructions.${prompt}

Good luck.;Oui, monsieur. La voici.${prompt}
I am counting on you.${prompt};Bonne chance.
You're back from Jeuno.;Je compte sur vous.${prompt}
No time to chat. Come with me.${prompt};You're back from Jeuno.
You say someone snuck a familiar into the President's Office, but you were not warned of its presence?${prompt};No time to chat. Come with me.${prompt}
Yes, sir. We were taken by surprise.;You say someone snuck a familiar into the President's Office, but you were not warned of its presence?${prompt}
I did not think anything like this was possible...${prompt};Yes, sir. We were taken by surprise.
Sir Lucius did send me a report stating that our magical defenses were inadequate, but I didn't think that they would be so easy to break...${prompt};I did not think anything like this was possible...${prompt}
...${prompt};Sir Lucius did send me a report stating that our magical defenses were inadequate, but I didn't think that they would be so easy to break...${prompt}

Cornelia, this does not concern you.;Father!${prompt}
Go to your room.${prompt};Cornelia, this does not concern you.
Lucius, explain what happened.${prompt};Go to your room.${prompt}
The familiar used magic to infiltrate the building...then it proceeded to cross the office straight toward the president's private chambers.${prompt};Lucius, explain what happened.${prompt}
Fortunately, the president was awake at the time, and was not injured...${prompt};The familiar used magic to infiltrate the building...then it proceeded to cross the office straight toward the president's private chambers.${prompt}
But they took the talisman.${prompt};Fortunately, the president was awake at the time, and was not injured...${prompt}
The talisman!?;But they took the talisman.${prompt}
The key to the Shadow Lord's seal!?${prompt};The talisman!?
Twenty years ago, our allied forces defeated the Shadow Lord in the Northlands and sealed him away from our world. Chief Cid and Captain Volker were there, I believe.${prompt};The key to the Shadow Lord's seal!?${prompt}
The three parts of the key to the seal, the talismans, were given to each nation's leader for safekeeping.;Twenty years ago, our allied forces defeated the Shadow Lord in the Northlands and sealed him away from our world. Chief Cid and Captain Volker were there, I believe.${prompt}
But now, at least one of them is gone...${prompt};The three parts of the key to the seal, the talismans, were given to each nation's leader for safekeeping.
Who would do such a thing?${prompt};But now, at least one of them is gone...${prompt}
Have you not found the culprit yet?;Who would do such a thing?${prompt}
Granted, there are many who bear ill feelings towards me...${prompt};Have you not found the culprit yet?
But then again, those fools in the Senate are too busy squabbling with each other, and the Galka rebels are too savage to possess any magic skills...${prompt};Granted, there are many who bear ill feelings towards me...${prompt}
...${prompt};But then again, those fools in the Senate are too busy squabbling with each other, and the Galka rebels are too savage to possess any magic skills...${prompt}
Father! Don't talk about the Galka that way!${prompt};...${prompt}
Why are you still here?;Father! Don't talk about the Galka that way!${prompt}
Did I not tell you to go to your room?${prompt};Why are you still here?
...${prompt};Did I not tell you to go to your room?${prompt}
From the reports we have received from the other nations, we must assume that the Kindred are trying to bring the Shadow Lord back.${prompt};...${prompt}
Then we must go to the Northlands to investigate!${prompt};From the reports we have received from the other nations, we must assume that the Kindred are trying to bring the Shadow Lord back.${prompt}
The Senate would have to approve before I can let the Mythril Musketeers go so far away from the city.${prompt};Then we must go to the Northlands to investigate!${prompt}
It would take too much time, and time is a luxury we cannot afford.;The Senate would have to approve before I can let the Mythril Musketeers go so far away from the city.${prompt}
Besides, the Senate has no sense of crisis--they would just reject my proposal.${prompt};It would take too much time, and time is a luxury we cannot afford.
Then...${prompt};Besides, the Senate has no sense of crisis--they would just reject my proposal.${prompt}
We have to find someone with no legal constraints.${prompt};Then...${prompt}

You do not have to answer right away, but do you accept?${prompt};I am assigning you a mission, adventurer, and putting you under the Musketeers' jurisdiction.${prompt}

I need some time.${prompt};Yes.
Then let us talk in private.;I need some time.${prompt}

Very well.;Volker, come with us.${prompt}
Talk to the guard in charge of missions when you feel you are ready.${prompt};Very well.
I hear you accepted the mission.;Talk to the guard in charge of missions when you feel you are ready.${prompt}
Come with me.${prompt};I hear you accepted the mission.
First, let me tell you about your destination.;Come with me.${prompt}
You are to journey to the cursed Northlands, to the ruins of Fei'Yin. You will find the ruins at the northeastern corner of the Beaucedine Glacier.${prompt};First, let me tell you about your destination.
The city of Fei'Yin was built in ancient times by a civilization far more advanced than ours.${prompt};You are to journey to the cursed Northlands, to the ruins of Fei'Yin. You will find the ruins at the northeastern corner of the Beaucedine Glacier.${prompt}
We believe they called themselves the Zilart.;The city of Fei'Yin was built in ancient times by a civilization far more advanced than ours.${prompt}
There are many other ruins in Vana'diel thought to be of their making.${prompt};We believe they called themselves the Zilart.
Considering how long ago they were built, their state of preservation is astounding.;There are many other ruins in Vana'diel thought to be of their making.${prompt}
It is as if they are protected by some unseen force that defies time itself.${prompt};Considering how long ago they were built, their state of preservation is astounding.
Thirty years ago, a multinational team was sent to the Northlands to try to uncover the secrets of the Zilart's power.${prompt};It is as if they are protected by some unseen force that defies time itself.${prompt}
Ulrich, Volker's uncle--and the captain of the Mythril Musketeers at the time--led the Bastokan contingent of that expedition.${prompt};Thirty years ago, a multinational team was sent to the Northlands to try to uncover the secrets of the Zilart's power.${prompt}
Unfortunately, they came back empty-handed.${prompt};Ulrich, Volker's uncle--and the captain of the Mythril Musketeers at the time--led the Bastokan contingent of that expedition.${prompt}

Captain Volker will tell you the way to your destination.;...${prompt}
He undertook the same journey twenty years ago, near the end of the Great War.${prompt};Captain Volker will tell you the way to your destination.
Even before the war, Fei'Yin was overrun with fiends. We captured it from the Shadow Lord at the cost of many lives.${prompt};He undertook the same journey twenty years ago, near the end of the Great War.${prompt}
After the war, we set seals on both sides of the border to keep the Shadow Lord's minions at bay.;Even before the war, Fei'Yin was overrun with fiends. We captured it from the Shadow Lord at the cost of many lives.${prompt}
One seal in the ruined coliseum on the inside, and another in Fei'Yin on the outside.${prompt};After the war, we set seals on both sides of the border to keep the Shadow Lord's minions at bay.
That was twenty years ago. In those days, we could reach the Beaucedine Glacier from East Ronfaure through Ranguemont Pass.${prompt};One seal in the ruined coliseum on the inside, and another in Fei'Yin on the outside.${prompt}
That is still the only way there, but I believe San d'Oria is guarding that road now.;That was twenty years ago. In those days, we could reach the Beaucedine Glacier from East Ronfaure through Ranguemont Pass.${prompt}
You will have to find some way through.${prompt};That is still the only way there, but I believe San d'Oria is guarding that road now.

If it is not, replace it with the one we will be providing you.${prompt};Your objective is to ascertain that the seal in Fei'Yin is still intact.
You do have an airship pass, do you not?${prompt};If it is not, replace it with the one we will be providing you.${prompt}
Head to Jeuno, and take the flight to San d'Oria as soon as possible.;You do have an airship pass, do you not?${prompt}
You are dismissed.${prompt};Head to Jeuno, and take the flight to San d'Oria as soon as possible.
Whoa! You made it back from Fei'Yin in one piece!;You are dismissed.${prompt}
Come with me, quick!${prompt};Whoa! You made it back from Fei'Yin in one piece!
So...the seal in Fei'Yin was also broken.${prompt};Come with me, quick!${prompt}
Where were the San d'Orians!?;So...the seal in Fei'Yin was also broken.${prompt}
It was their duty to protect it!${prompt};Where were the San d'Orians!?
Mister President?;It was their duty to protect it!${prompt}
Should we ask the Senate about an incursion to Zvahl?${prompt};Mister President?
We seem to have no other choice.;Should we ask the Senate about an incursion to Zvahl?${prompt}
But until they come to a decision, our hands are tied.${prompt};We seem to have no other choice.
We would like you to stand by for further orders.;But until they come to a decision, our hands are tied.${prompt}

I heard you mention meeting a Galka dressed all in black in Fei'Yin.;We have preparations to make.${prompt}
Tell me more about him.${prompt};I heard you mention meeting a Galka dressed all in black in Fei'Yin.
As I thought...it is Zeid.;Tell me more about him.${prompt}
Then he has been tracking the Kindred ever since he disappeared twenty years ago.${prompt};As I thought...it is Zeid.

Still, why has he been hiding from us?;He is the one who defeated the Shadow Lord... He should have been Captain, not I.${prompt}
What is there in the Northlands that would change Zeid, and even my uncle, so much?${prompt};Still, why has he been hiding from us?
Ah, I apologize. It is not my place to ask these questions. I am but a Musketeer, a humble soldier of Bastok.${prompt};What is there in the Northlands that would change Zeid, and even my uncle, so much?${prompt}
Huh? No, this isn't the Blacksmiths' Guild.;Ah, I apologize. It is not my place to ask these questions. I am but a Musketeer, a humble soldier of Bastok.${prompt}
That's to the northwest.${prompt};Huh? No, this isn't the Blacksmiths' Guild.

Designing new products isn't easy. I don't know how Chief Cid does it, coming up with new inventions almost every week.${prompt};Working with machines beats working in the mines any day.${prompt}
To be honest, it's not always easy working with Humes, but you get used to it. You have to.${prompt};Designing new products isn't easy. I don't know how Chief Cid does it, coming up with new inventions almost every week.${prompt}

The only drawback is that it's a little heavy.${prompt};Darksteel is an alloy harder yet more flexible than regular steel. What's more, it neither stains nor rusts.

Knowing Humes, though, they would've figured it out eventually, and come up with something better.${prompt};Its formula was a Galkan secret for a long time, but lately we've decided to teach Humes how to make it, too.${prompt}

Normally, only factory workers are allowed in, but...${prompt};Can I help you? This is the Cermet Refinery.
Well, I guess you're okay.;Normally, only factory workers are allowed in, but...${prompt}
Do you know what cermet is? It's an alloy that's harder and lighter than steel, doesn't rust, and can withstand extreme heat. Amazing, isn't it?${prompt};Well, I guess you're okay.
It's the byproduct of recent breakthroughs in alchemy.;Do you know what cermet is? It's an alloy that's harder and lighter than steel, doesn't rust, and can withstand extreme heat. Amazing, isn't it?${prompt}

I-I see. Ms. Hilda said that, huh?;...${prompt}
But I didn't mean to--no, never mind.;I-I see. Ms. Hilda said that, huh?

Did you say something, Chief?${prompt};Especially not Raibaht.${prompt}

Good of you to come.;But tell the proprietor I will go visit her establishment as soon as I can.${prompt}
The reason why I didn't have Naji or Iron Eater bring you here is because the secrecy of this mission is paramount.${prompt};Good of you to come.
Volker will soon join us.;The reason why I didn't have Naji or Iron Eater bring you here is because the secrecy of this mission is paramount.${prompt}
Let us talk in my private chambers.;Volker will soon join us.
Come.${prompt};Let us talk in my private chambers.
Galina, tell Volker to come to my private chambers when he arrives.${prompt};Come.${prompt}
We could not get the Senate's approval. The Musketeers won't be allowed to leave the city gates.;Galina, tell Volker to come to my private chambers when he arrives.${prompt}
Those fools think that Bastok should not get itself involved...${prompt};We could not get the Senate's approval. The Musketeers won't be allowed to leave the city gates.
“Let San d'Oria deal with the Northlands,” they said! What do they think the Musketeers are for!? Surely they don't intend to use them in another war with San d'Oria!${prompt};Those fools think that Bastok should not get itself involved...${prompt}
I admit that Bastok would do anything for its own gain. That is how we have come so far--myself as well.${prompt};“Let San d'Oria deal with the Northlands,” they said! What do they think the Musketeers are for!? Surely they don't intend to use them in another war with San d'Oria!${prompt}
Bastok's success is a result of aggression and initiative. But with the Senate dawdling so, we may pay dearly for our lack of action.${prompt};I admit that Bastok would do anything for its own gain. That is how we have come so far--myself as well.${prompt}
Remember one thing: you are an adventurer, not a hero.;Bastok's success is a result of aggression and initiative. But with the Senate dawdling so, we may pay dearly for our lack of action.${prompt}
You have no duty to the majority--especially one that chooses to stay idle at a time like this.${prompt};Remember one thing: you are an adventurer, not a hero.
Go on this mission for your own gain. That is the Bastokan way.;You have no duty to the majority--especially one that chooses to stay idle at a time like this.${prompt}

Volker.;Do not concern yourself with responsibility--let a certain president and a Musketeer captain worry about that.${prompt}
Come.${prompt};Volker.
Tell the adventurer what you know of Castle Zvahl.;Come.${prompt}
We do not have much time. Be brief.${prompt};Tell the adventurer what you know of Castle Zvahl.
Cross the Beaucedine Glacier to the northernmost corner of Quon, the frozen land of Xarcabard.${prompt};We do not have much time. Be brief.${prompt}
There you will find Castle Zvahl, the Kindred's stronghold.;Cross the Beaucedine Glacier to the northernmost corner of Quon, the frozen land of Xarcabard.${prompt}
That is where our allied forces defeated the Shadow Lord twenty years ago.${prompt};There you will find Castle Zvahl, the Kindred's stronghold.
But now, someone is trying to bring the Shadow Lord back.;That is where our allied forces defeated the Shadow Lord twenty years ago.${prompt}
We must stop them, no matter what the cost.${prompt};But now, someone is trying to bring the Shadow Lord back.
If you are too late, and they succeed...you and your friends must try to defeat the Shadow Lord yourselves, as Cid, Zeid, and I once did.${prompt};We must stop them, no matter what the cost.${prompt}
You adventurers hold the future of Vana'diel in your hands.;If you are too late, and they succeed...you and your friends must try to defeat the Shadow Lord yourselves, as Cid, Zeid, and I once did.${prompt}
We cannot accompany you, but our hopes and hearts go with you.${prompt};You adventurers hold the future of Vana'diel in your hands.
Go finish your preparations and leave as soon as possible.;We cannot accompany you, but our hopes and hearts go with you.${prompt}
You are dismissed.${prompt};Go finish your preparations and leave as soon as possible.
Wait... If you see Zeid, tell him that he has yet to best me in a fight...and that he should come back and challenge me.${prompt};You are dismissed.${prompt}
You've done it!;Wait... If you see Zeid, tell him that he has yet to best me in a fight...and that he should come back and challenge me.${prompt}
You stopped them from bringing back the Shadow Lord!?${prompt};You've done it!
What are you talking about, Volker?;You stopped them from bringing back the Shadow Lord!?${prompt}
They probably defeated him and sent him back where he belongs!;What are you talking about, Volker?
Am I right?${prompt};They probably defeated him and sent him back where he belongs!
What? Defeat him? But that's...${prompt};Am I right?${prompt}
Impossible? You find it hard to believe that some adventurer could defeat the Shadow Lord, Captain? Have you not heard what the townspeople are saying?${prompt};Quoi ? Le vaincre ? Mais c'est...${prompt}
They're saying the Age of the Adventurers has come!${prompt};Impossible ? Vous trouvez difficile de croire qu'un aventurier pourrait vaincre le Seigneur des Ombres, Capitaine ? N'avez-vous pas entendu ce que disent les habitants ?${prompt}
Hmph. Only historians, in posterity, have the privilege of saying such things.${prompt};Ils disent que l'Âge des Aventuriers est arrivé !${prompt}
And it does not matter if they only stopped the Shadow Lord from returning, or if they actually defeated him.${prompt};Hmph. Seuls les historiens, avec le recul, ont le privilège de dire de telles choses.${prompt}
The important thing is that they kept the Kindred from gaining power.;Et il n'importe pas s'ils ont seulement empêché le retour du Seigneur des Ombres, ou s'ils l'ont réellement vaincu.${prompt}
And that, I believe, deserves a reward.${prompt};L'important, c'est qu'ils ont empêché les Kindred de gagner en puissance.
Good work. I am raising your rank.;Et cela, je crois, mérite une récompense.${prompt}
And here is your well-deserved reward.${prompt};Bon travail. Je vous augmente en grade.
The Shadow Lord may have been vanquished again, but the Kindred are far from defeated.;Et voici votre récompense bien méritée.${prompt}
I have received reports of strange goings-on in the beastmen's strongholds.${prompt};Le Seigneur des Ombres a peut-être été vaincu à nouveau, mais les Kindred sont loin d'être battus.
You've probably heard this too many times, but...we're counting on you.${prompt};J'ai reçu des rapports d'événements étranges dans les forteresses des hommes-bêtes.${prompt}
So that was who the Shadow Lord was...;Vous avez probablement entendu cela trop de fois, mais...nous comptons sur vous.${prompt}
Zeid must have known, and that's probably why he went off on his own.${prompt};Alors c'était qui le Seigneur des Ombres...
Don't tell Volker about this. Ulrich's fate should also be kept from him, too. He may not be able to accept it yet.${prompt};Zeid devait le savoir, et c'est probablement pourquoi il est parti seul.${prompt}
He admired his grandfather a lot...that's why it pained him to hear people say that Volker, himself, only became Captain because Raogrimm was gone.${prompt};Ne dites rien de cela à Volker. Le sort d'Ulrich doit également lui être caché. Il ne pourrait peut-être pas l'accepter encore.${prompt}
I know that hiding the truth from him is not a good thing, but most of us are not as strong as you. We need time to heal.${prompt};Il admirait beaucoup son grand-père...c'est pourquoi cela lui faisait mal d'entendre dire que Volker lui-même n'était devenu Capitaine que parce que Raogrimm n'était plus là.${prompt}
Sorry to interrupt. What are you two talking about?${prompt};Je sais que lui cacher la vérité n'est pas une bonne chose, mais la plupart d'entre nous ne sont pas aussi forts que vous. Nous avons besoin de temps pour guérir.${prompt}
Uh...just saying that Karst really hasn't changed, even after all of this.${prompt};Désolé de vous interrompre. De quoi parlez-vous tous les deux ?${prompt}
Yes, but I think I understand him better now.;Euh...juste de dire que Karst n'a vraiment pas changé, même après tout cela.${prompt}
I may have been judging him too harshly.${prompt};Oui, mais je pense que je le comprends mieux maintenant.
Speaking of which...you still have not told us why you backed President Karst in the last elections, Chief.${prompt};Je l'ai peut-être jugé trop sévèrement.${prompt}
Oh, that. Well... Fifteen years ago, even after I resigned my post as head of the Gunpowder Room, the Senate was still in chaos, trying to find more people to blame for the accident in Palborough.${prompt};En parlant de cela...vous ne nous avez toujours pas dit pourquoi vous avez soutenu le Président Karst lors des dernières élections, Chef.${prompt}
But there was one junior senator there who proposed we abandon Palborough and reopen the Zeruhn Mines. That junior senator was Karst.${prompt};Oh, ça. Eh bien... Il y a quinze ans, même après ma démission de mon poste de chef de la Salle de la Poudre, le Sénat était toujours en chaos, essayant de trouver plus de personnes à blâmer pour l'accident à Palborough.${prompt}
The miners stood to lose a lot, but at the time, his proposal was Bastok's best bet.;Mais il y avait un jeune sénateur qui a proposé d'abandonner Palborough et de rouvrir les Mines de Zeruhn. Ce jeune sénateur était Karst.${prompt}
I'm an engineer, so I respect skill. And I felt that Karst's political skills could be trusted.${prompt};Les mineurs risquaient de perdre beaucoup, mais à l'époque, sa proposition était le meilleur pari pour Bastok.
And he's a real Bastoker, too--very ambitious, and real easy to figure out.;Je suis un ingénieur, donc je respecte la compétence. Et j'ai senti que les compétences politiques de Karst pouvaient être dignes de confiance.${prompt}
I can still remember the eager look on his face when he announced his proposal to the Senate!${prompt};Et c'est un vrai Bastoker aussi--très ambitieux et facile à comprendre.
Hah hah hah!${prompt};Je me souviens encore du regard enthousiaste qu'il avait lorsqu'il a annoncé sa proposition au Sénat !${prompt}
Lady Cornelia is not here at the moment.;Hah hah hah!${prompt}
I hope she doesn't stay out too late...${prompt};Lady Cornelia n'est pas ici en ce moment.
Lady Cornelia is in her room doing her studies.;J'espère qu'elle ne rentrera pas trop tard...${prompt}
Please come back some other--${prompt};Lady Cornelia est dans sa chambre en train d'étudier.
I've had enough of studying. I'm going out!${prompt};Revenez une autre fois--${prompt}
Milady, don't--;J'en ai assez d'étudier. Je sors !${prompt}
Oh, not again!${prompt};Milady, ne--
Why must she be like this?;Oh, encore une fois !${prompt}
If the First Lady were still alive, she would never have tolerated this kind of behavior!${prompt};Pourquoi doit-elle être comme ça ?
Lady Cornelia is in her room doing her studies.;Si la Première Dame était encore en vie, elle n'aurait jamais toléré ce genre de comportement !${prompt}
For once, she isn't--${prompt};Lady Cornelia est dans sa chambre en train d'étudier.
No, Milady! Not this time! The president has given me strict orders not to let you out of your--${prompt};Pour une fois, elle ne--${prompt}
Hello.;Non, Milady ! Pas cette fois ! Le président m'a donné des ordres stricts de ne pas vous laisser sortir de votre--${prompt}
Come in.${prompt};Bonjour.
Oh, you were expecting a guest!;Entrez.${prompt}
I'm sorry, I thought you were trying to sneak out--${prompt};Oh, vous attendiez un invité !
Wait, Milady, no! You shouldn't be letting some adventurer into your room!;Je suis désolé, je pensais que vous essayiez de vous échapper--${prompt}
You know the kind of places they frequent! And it wouldn't be proper!${prompt};Attendez, Milady, non ! Vous ne devriez pas laisser entrer un aventurier dans votre chambre !
Oh, brother... Can you believe her?;Vous savez quels endroits ils fréquentent ! Et ce ne serait pas convenable !${prompt}
This is what I have to put up with every day.;Oh, la la... Pouvez-vous la croire ?
I usually manage to sneak out, though.${prompt};C'est ce que je dois endurer chaque jour.
I've been meaning to ask you--have you ever heard the story of Cornelia the Musketeer?${prompt};Mais je parviens généralement à sortir en douce.${prompt}
Have you ever heard of a Musketeer named Cornelia?;Je voulais vous demander--avez-vous déjà entendu l'histoire de Cornelia la Mousquetaire ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Avez-vous déjà entendu parler d'une Mousquetaire nommée Cornelia ?
Yes, I have.;${selection-lines}
Who?${prompt};Oui, je l'ai entendu.
Cornelia, the monk who became a Mythril Musketeer, is pretty famous.;Qui ?${prompt}
She helped all those in need, whether they were Galka or Hume, rich or poor.${prompt};Cornelia, la moine devenue Mythril Mousquetaire, est assez célèbre.
You've never heard of her? She was a monk who became a Mythril Musketeer. She helped all those in need, Galka and Hume, rich and poor alike.${prompt};Elle aidait tous ceux dans le besoin, qu'ils soient Galka ou Hume, riches ou pauvres.${prompt}
It was rumored that she and Talekeeper Raogrimm--the only Galka destined to have become a Musketeer Captain if he were still alive--were sharing a forbidden love...${prompt};Tu n'as jamais entendu parler d'elle ? C'était une moine devenue Mousquetaire de Mythril. Elle aidait tous ceux qui étaient dans le besoin, Galka et Humains, riches et pauvres.${prompt}
But no one knows if that was true, since neither returned from their expedition to Xarcabard thirty years ago.${prompt};On disait qu'elle et Talekeeper Raogrimm – le seul Galka destiné à devenir Capitaine des Mousquetaires s'il était encore en vie – partageaient un amour interdit...${prompt}
My mother named me after her. She told me that she wanted me to grow up to be just like her--someone who would treat everyone equally, and loved by all.${prompt};Mais personne ne sait si c'est vrai, car aucun des deux n'est revenu de leur expédition à Xarcabard il y a trente ans.${prompt}
Maybe that's why I try so hard to help the Galka...though even if I weren't named Cornelia, I wouldn't stand by and watch them be treated like they are.${prompt};Ma mère m'a nommée d'après elle. Elle m'a dit qu'elle voulait que je grandisse pour être comme elle – quelqu'un qui traite tout le monde de manière égale, et aimée de tous.${prompt}
But it's no good. You've seen it, too. I just can't seem to do anything right. I wish I were as strong and smart as Lady Cornelia...${prompt};C'est peut-être pour ça que j'essaie tellement d'aider les Galka... bien que même si je ne m'appelais pas Cornelia, je ne resterais pas sans rien faire en les voyant être traités comme ça.${prompt}
This Galka child told me the other day, “Why are you trying so hard? What can you do, you're just a girl!”${prompt};Mais ce n'est pas bon. Tu l'as vu toi-même. Je n'arrive tout simplement pas à faire les choses correctement. J'aimerais être aussi forte et intelligente que Lady Cornelia...${prompt}
Maybe he's right. Maybe I can't change anything...${prompt};Un enfant Galka m'a dit l'autre jour, “Pourquoi tu te donnes tant de mal ? Qu'est-ce que tu peux faire, tu n'es qu'une fille !”${prompt}
No! I've got to try harder!;Peut-être qu'il a raison. Peut-être que je ne peux rien changer...${prompt}
I'll show that know-it-all, Gumbah, what I can do!${prompt};Non ! Je dois essayer plus fort !
I'm sorry to leave you like this, but I've got to go!${prompt};Je vais montrer à ce prétentieux de Gumbah ce que je peux faire !${prompt}
These doors lead to the President's Office.${prompt};Je suis désolée de te laisser comme ça, mais je dois y aller !${prompt}
Enter the President's Office?;Ces portes mènent au Bureau du Président.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Entrer dans le Bureau du Président ?
Yes.;${selection-lines}
No.${prompt};Oui.
Exit the President's Office?;Non.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Sortir du Bureau du Président ?
Yes.;${selection-lines}
No.${prompt};Oui.
I am compiling data on the effects of Bastok's mining and industrial projects on the environment.${prompt};Non.${prompt}
These wheels are enough to power Bastok now, but what will they do when the city's needs exceed the amount of energy they can produce?${prompt};Je compile des données sur les effets des projets miniers et industriels de Bastok sur l'environnement.${prompt}
I've heard adventurers say that the Quadav dumping of industrial waste has polluted Beadeaux and its surrounding areas.${prompt};Ces roues sont suffisantes pour alimenter Bastok maintenant, mais que feront-ils quand les besoins de la ville dépasseront la quantité d'énergie qu'elles peuvent produire ?${prompt}
I'd like to examine some of that ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.;J'ai entendu des aventuriers dire que le déversement de déchets industriels par les Quadav a pollué Beadeaux et ses environs.${prompt}
I've heard you can find some near their forges, and that it's also easier to spot on rainy days.${prompt};J'aimerais examiner un peu de ce ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}.
Ah, you've brought me some of the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} from Beadeaux I asked for!;J'ai entendu dire que tu peux en trouver près de leurs forges, et que c'est plus facile à repérer les jours de pluie.${prompt}
Thank you. This will help me in my research.${prompt};Ah, tu m'as apporté un peu du ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} de Beadeaux que je t'avais demandé !
Hume scientists say they don't give a damn about the Quadav environment, but this may be of use to us in the future... Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to gripe. Here, let me reward you.${prompt};Merci. Cela m'aidera dans mes recherches.${prompt}
Look around you. Do you see what Bastokan technology can do?;Les scientifiques Humains disent qu'ils se fichent de l'environnement des Quadav, mais cela pourrait nous être utile à l'avenir... Oh, désolé, je ne voulais pas râler. Tiens, laisse-moi te récompenser.${prompt}
This technology is what makes us better than San d'Oria or even Windurst.${prompt};Regarde autour de toi. Tu vois ce que la technologie bastokanienne peut faire ?
And thanks to that technology, I can let the machines do the work while I sit here and do nothing all day!${prompt};Cette technologie est ce qui nous rend meilleurs que San d'Oria ou même Windurst.${prompt}
This water wheel square is the center of Bastok.;Et grâce à cette technologie, je peux laisser les machines faire le travail pendant que je reste ici à ne rien faire toute la journée !${prompt}
That building to the east is the President's Office.${prompt};Cette place de la roue à eau est le centre de Bastok.
The Presidential Aide's Office is to the southeast, while the consulates of Jeuno, Windurst, and San d'Oria are, respectively, to the northeast, northwest, and southwest of the square.${prompt};Ce bâtiment à l'est est le Bureau du Président.${prompt}
It's locked.${prompt};Le Bureau de l'Aide Présidentielle est au sud-est, tandis que les consulats de Jeuno, Windurst, et San d'Oria sont respectivement au nord-est, au nord-ouest, et au sud-ouest de la place.${prompt}
That star is here...no, it's in that constellation there... Hm? What am I doing? Oh, I'm trying to match real stars with the ones on this map, but it's not as easy as it looks.${prompt};C'est verrouillé.${prompt}
Say, you're an adventurer, aren't you? You must've been to a lot of places, seen many different skies... Would you like to take a look?${prompt};Cette étoile est ici... non, elle est dans cette constellation là... Hein ? Qu'est-ce que je fais ? Oh, j'essaie de faire correspondre les vraies étoiles avec celles sur cette carte, mais ce n'est pas aussi facile que ça en a l'air.${prompt}
Look at the stellar map?;Dis, tu es un aventurier, n'est-ce pas ? Tu as dû voyager dans beaucoup d'endroits, vu de nombreux ciels différents... Ça te dirait de jeter un coup d'œil ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Regarder la carte stellaire ?
Yes.;${selection-lines}
No.${prompt};Oui.
Oh, I-I'm sorry.;Non.${prompt}
Of course, you wouldn't be interested in stars...;Oh, je-je suis désolé.
Goodbye!${prompt};Bien sûr, les étoiles ne t'intéressent pas...
I knew you'd be interested!;Au revoir !${prompt}
This map was drawn by the famous Windurstian astronomer, Professor Lago-Charago!${prompt};Je savais que ça t'intéresserait !
See that constellation to the south? That's Bastok's guardian, Titan!;Cette carte a été dessinée par le célèbre astronome windurstien, le Professeur Lago-Charago !${prompt}
But not many people know that now. It's been a long time since we've celebrated Titan's Eve.${prompt};Vois cette constellation au sud ? C'est le gardien de Bastok, Titan !
The yellow star at its center is Daemdalus, or “Titan's left foot.” It used to be a lot brighter in the old days, and soldiers returning from battle followed it back to Bastok.${prompt};Mais plus grand monde ne le sait maintenant. Cela fait longtemps que nous n'avons pas célébré la Veillée de Titan.${prompt}
I'm glad to have met someone else who likes looking at the stars.;L'étoile jaune en son centre est Daemdalus, ou “le pied gauche de Titan.” Elle était beaucoup plus brillante autrefois, et les soldats revenant de la bataille la suivaient pour rentrer à Bastok.${prompt}
Maybe we can talk about them more sometime.${prompt};Je suis content d'avoir rencontré quelqu'un d'autre qui aime regarder les étoiles.
You are in the Metalworks.;Peut-être pourrons-nous en parler davantage un jour.${prompt}
Would you like to see a map of Bastok?${prompt};Tu es dans les Manufactures.
Look at map of Bastok?;Veux-tu voir une carte de Bastok ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Regarder la carte de Bastok ?
Yes.;${selection-lines}
No.${prompt};Oui.
Factories, the Blacksmiths' Guild, and administrative buildings--including the President's Office--are all here in the Metalworks.${prompt};Non.${prompt}
The Blacksmiths' Guild is on the first floor.;Les usines, la Guilde des Forgerons, et les bâtiments administratifs--y compris le Bureau du Président--se trouvent tous ici, dans les Manufactures.${prompt}
Ride the elevator up to the second floor and go east past the water wheels to get to the President's Office.${prompt};La Guilde des Forgerons est au rez-de-chaussée.
You've become quite an experienced adventurer, I hear. I feel I can trust you.${prompt};Prends l'ascenseur jusqu'au premier étage et va à l'est après les roues à eau pour arriver au Bureau du Président.${prompt}
I need you to go on an errand for me.;On dit que tu es devenu un aventurier assez expérimenté. Je sens que je peux te faire confiance.${prompt}
Our supply of ${item-plural: 6[2]} is running low. Bring us two of them.${prompt};J'ai besoin que tu me rendes un service.
The Zeruhn Mines haven't been yielding much of it lately.;Notre stock de ${item-plural: 6[2]} est presque épuisé. Apporte-nous-en deux.${prompt}
You may have better luck in the Gusgen Mines.${prompt};Les Mines de Zeruhn n'en produisent plus beaucoup ces temps-ci.
Thank you. Here is your payment.;Tu auras peut-être plus de chance dans les Mines de Gusgen.${prompt}
If you find any more, bring them here.${prompt};Merci. Voici ton paiement.

Of course, it won't be free once it gets going, but for now, I'm looking for volunteers to try it out and tell me what they think! No charge!${prompt};Tu sais, si tu leur montres des endroits vraiment intéressants, ça leur donnerait envie d'explorer davantage, non ?${prompt}
You wanna try?;Bien sûr, une fois que ça sera lancé, ça ne sera pas gratuit, mais pour l'instant, je recherche des volontaires pour essayer et me dire ce qu'ils en pensent ! C'est gratuit !${prompt}
You'll have to be in a party where all members are level fifteen or less.${prompt};Tu veux essayer ?

Hmm... I guess starting a new kind of business is harder than I thought...${prompt};Rencontrez-le après avoir formé une équipe qui répond à mes critères, et il vous paiera pour avoir participé au test.${prompt}

There is an emergency.;J'ai entendu un aventurier dire qu'il y avait parfois ces monstres huileux à Beadeaux. Je me demande...${prompt}
Promptly make your way to the President's Office.;Il y a une urgence.
Ask Naji, and he will guide you.${prompt};Rendez-vous immédiatement au Bureau du Président.
Master Oggbi! There was no need for you to come all the way here. We would have come to you.${prompt};Demandez à Naji, il vous guidera.${prompt}
No, when I heard of “his” revival, my blood began to boil.${prompt};Maitre Oggbi! Il n'était pas nécessaire que vous veniez jusqu'ici. Nous serions venus à vous.${prompt}
We think that it may be an offspring of the new generation of Yagudo. We also feel that the Kindred's rise in power may also factor into his return.${prompt};Non, quand j'ai entendu parler de sa résurrection, mon sang s'est mis à bouillonner.${prompt}
Currently, the Mythril Musketeers are comprised solely of warriors, samurai, and a missing dark knight. No competent monks exist.${prompt};Nous pensons qu'il pourrait s'agir d'une descendance de la nouvelle génération de Yagudo. Nous pensons également que la montée en puissance des Kindreds pourrait également contribuer à son retour.${prompt}
San d'Oria is more than likely in the same predicament. The monastery is no longer able to produce the quality monks of old.;Actuellement, les Mythril Musketeers sont uniquement composés de guerriers, de samouraïs et d'un chevalier noir disparu. Aucun moine compétent n'existe.${prompt}
And Windurst...those Tarutaru and their magic aren't good for anything.${prompt};San d'Oria est plus que probablement dans la même situation. Le monastère n'est plus en mesure de produire les moines de qualité d'autrefois.
I've made attempts to contact Norg, but no one seems willing to cooperate...${prompt};Et Windurst... ces Tarutaru et leur magie ne sont bons à rien.${prompt}
If they won't even take up a proposal from someone who did her training there, they definitely won't listen to me.${prompt};J'ai tenté de contacter Norg, mais personne ne semble prêt à coopérer...${prompt}
Norg no longer has any interest in the way of the San d'Orian monks. Their attention has turned to the arts of the samurai and ninja.${prompt};S'ils ne veulent même pas prendre en considération une proposition émanant de quelqu'un qui y a fait sa formation, ils n'écouteront certainement pas ce que j'ai à dire.${prompt}
And Dalzakk... Dalzakk is off on another mission, so that leaves only...${prompt};Norg n'a plus aucun intérêt pour la voie des moines de San d'Oria. Leur attention s'est tournée vers les arts du samouraï et du ninja.${prompt}
Why, if it isn't ${name-player}! You'd be perfect for the job!${prompt};Et Dalzakk... Dalzakk est parti en mission, donc il ne reste que...${prompt}
Do you think you'd be up to it?${prompt};Tiens, si ce n'est pas ${name-player} ! Tu serais parfait pour le travail !${prompt}
Master Oggbi. I think our adventurer has yet to be informed on the details of this predicament.${prompt};Penses-tu être à la hauteur ?${prompt}
It all began thirty years ago. A Yagudo with exponential power rose up in Vana'diel...${prompt};Maître Oggbi. Je pense que notre aventurier n'a pas encore été informé des détails de cette situation.${prompt}
Master! Please let me go with you! I'm more than ready!${prompt};Tout a commencé il y a trente ans. Un Yagudo doté d'un pouvoir exponentiel s'est levé à Vana'diel...${prompt}
No, no, no! You may have enough power to draw that Yagudo out of hiding, but you still lack the experience to defeat him.${prompt};Maître ! Permettez-moi de vous accompagner ! Je suis plus que prêt !${prompt}
But Master, the reason I became your student was so I could gain enough skill to defeat him... So I could avenge my brother's death...${prompt};Non, non, non ! Vous avez peut-être assez de puissance pour attirer ce Yagudo hors de sa cachette, mais vous manquez encore d'expérience pour le vaincre.${prompt}
Do you think I didn't know that?;Mais Maître, la raison pour laquelle je suis devenu votre élève était pour acquérir assez de compétences pour le vaincre... Pour pouvoir venger la mort de mon frère...${prompt}
Your brother was a talented monk who met a tragic death.;Penses-tu que je ne le savais pas ?
When you came to me, I put two and two together.${prompt};Ton frère était un moine talentueux qui a connu une mort tragique.
However, your vision is still clouded...clouded by the darkness of revenge.${prompt};Quand tu es venu à moi, j'ai fait le rapprochement.${prompt}
Master Oggbi... You have trained me well, and I thank you.;Cependant, ta vision est encore trouble... Obscurcie par les ténèbres de la vengeance.${prompt}
But if you believe that my vision is still clouded...${prompt};Maître Oggbi... Vous m'avez bien entraîné, et je vous en remercie.
...Then I must set out on my own to clear it!${prompt};Mais si vous croyez que ma vision est encore trouble...${prompt}
Cornelia...${prompt};...Alors je dois partir seul pour l’éclaircir !${prompt}
And she succeeded in bringing down that Yagudo. Whether that cleared her vision or not...${prompt};Cornelia...${prompt}
Well, he shows interest in monks who are at his level of power, and only comes out when suitable opponents make their way into his lair.${prompt};Et elle a réussi à abattre ce Yagudo. Que cela ait clarifié sa vision ou non...${prompt}
Take ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} and place it deep within the castle. Your strength is certain to catch his eye and draw him out of hiding.${prompt};Eh bien, il montre de l'intérêt pour les moines qui sont à son niveau de puissance, et ne sort que lorsque des adversaires appropriés se présentent dans son repaire.${prompt}
If you defeat him, he should leave ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}. Bring that back to me and I will reward you for your efforts.${prompt};Prenez ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]} et placez-le profondément dans le château. Votre force est sûre de attirer son attention et de le faire sortir de sa cachette.${prompt}
This is a task that I should be taking on myself, but I just don't have the legs for it anymore...${prompt};Si vous le battez, il devrait laisser ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}. Ramenez-le moi et je vous récompenserai pour vos efforts.${prompt}
This is... So you were able to defeat the Yagudo?;C'est une tâche que je devrais assumer moi-même, mais je n'ai tout simplement plus les jambes pour cela...${prompt}
I did not know such powerful monks still existed...${prompt};C'est... Alors vous avez réussi à vaincre les Yagudo ?
Long ago, Master Oggbi worked hard to promote the fusion of martial arts and San d'Orian combat techniques. Such a collaboration has obviously produced many outstanding fighters.${prompt};Je ne savais pas qu'il existait encore des moines aussi puissants...${prompt}
Even a samurai such as myself is in awe of your extraordinary ability. Please accept this as payment for your service.${prompt};Autrefois, Maître Oggbi travaillait dur pour promouvoir la fusion des arts martiaux et des techniques de combat san d'oréennes. Une telle collaboration a évidemment produit de nombreux combattants exceptionnels.${prompt}
Another item had been arranged for you, but Master Oggbi asked to present this to you instead.${prompt};Même un samouraï comme moi est admiratif de votre capacité extraordinaire. Veuillez accepter ceci en paiement de votre service.${prompt}
I see you have returned safely...;Un autre objet avait été prévu pour vous, mais Maître Oggbi a demandé de vous présenter ceci à la place.${prompt}
You have matured well as a monk.${prompt};Je vois que vous êtes revenu en toute sécurité...
This is a token of my gratitude. You remind me much of Cornelia...${prompt};Vous avez bien mûri en tant que moine.${prompt}
Yes, I remember she came to see me in the Metalworks when she returned...${prompt};Ceci est un témoignage de ma gratitude. Vous me rappelez beaucoup Cornelia...${prompt}
Cornelia! You're finally back...${prompt};Oui, je me souviens qu'elle est venue me voir dans les Forges quand elle est rentrée...${prompt}
Master... I apologize for creating so much trouble.${prompt};Cornelia ! Vous êtes enfin de retour...${prompt}
You need not worry of that...;Maître... Je suis désolée d'avoir tant causé de problèmes.${prompt}
Your vision... Is it still clouded as before?${prompt};Vous n'avez pas à vous en faire pour cela...
That's just it...;Votre vision... Est-elle toujours aussi trouble qu'auparavant ?${prompt}
I thought that by avenging my brother's death, I would be free of the demons that haunted me...but in truth, I feel as though a part of me died when I defeated that Yagudo...${prompt};C'est bien cela...
I see...${prompt};Je pensais qu'en vengeant la mort de mon frère, je serais libérée des démons qui me tourmentaient... mais en vérité, j'ai l'impression qu'une partie de moi est morte en vainquant ce Yagudo...${prompt}
Nothing comes of revenge. It merely results in us losing that which drives us.${prompt};Je vois...${prompt}
You...${prompt};Rien ne vient de la vengeance. Elle ne fait que nous faire perdre ce qui nous anime.${prompt}
It is said that those with nothing to lose are often the strongest.${prompt};Toi...${prompt}
More than likely you felt the same way, Cornelia.;On dit que ceux qui n'ont rien à perdre sont souvent les plus forts.${prompt}
But remember that if you have nothing to lose, you may have nothing at all...${prompt};Il est fort probable que tu aies ressenti la même chose, Cornelia.
...nothing worth protecting.;Mais souviens-toi que si tu n'as rien à perdre, tu peux ne rien avoir du tout...${prompt}
True strength comes to those who have something, or someone, to protect.${prompt};...rien qui vaille la peine d'être protégé.
And you...have something worth protecting?${prompt};La véritable force vient à ceux qui ont quelque chose, ou quelqu'un, à protéger.${prompt}
I carry with me over two hundred years of memories. At times they can be a burden, but it is my duty to protect them.${prompt};Et vous... avez-vous quelque chose qui vaut la peine d'être protégé ?${prompt}
To protect the smiles of the people in those memories, I can handle the treatment I receive from those petty politicians in the President's Office.${prompt};Je porte avec moi plus de deux cents ans de souvenirs. Parfois, ils peuvent être un fardeau, mais c'est mon devoir de les protéger.${prompt}
Will I ever find something...something worth protecting? ${prompt};Pour protéger les sourires des personnes dans ces souvenirs, je peux supporter le traitement que je reçois de ces politiciens mesquins du Bureau du Président.${prompt}
I am certain that one day you will.${prompt};Trouverai-je jamais quelque chose... quelque chose qui vaut la peine d'être protégé ?${prompt}
And that was the dawn of a new Musketeer in Cornelia.${prompt};Je suis sûr qu'un jour vous le trouverez.${prompt}
You, too, must make a pledge--that you will never use your ability to lose something.;Et c'était l'aube d'un nouveau Mousquetaire chez Cornelia.${prompt}
Make that pledge, and your power will never betray you.${prompt};Vous aussi, vous devez faire un serment - que vous n'utiliserez jamais votre capacité pour perdre quelque chose.
I still believe to this day that Cornelia made that pledge...${prompt};Faites ce serment, et votre pouvoir ne vous trahira jamais.${prompt}
What? My grandma asked you to bring ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} to me?${prompt};Je crois encore aujourd'hui que Cornelia a fait ce serment...${prompt}
I can't believe her. “My grandson the doorman.” I get teased enough by Ayame, but to be ridiculed by my own flesh and blood!;Quoi ? Ma grand-mère vous a demandé de m’apporter ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} ?${prompt}
And this sword... What's the big deal, anyway?${prompt};"Je n'arrive pas à le croire. ""Mon petit-fils le portier."" Je suis assez taquiné par Ayame, mais être ridiculisé par mon propre sang !"
What's wrong, Naji?${prompt};Et cette épée... Qu'est-ce que ça peut bien faire, de toute façon ?${prompt}
Ah, Sir Iron Eater.;Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas, Naji ?${prompt}
My grandmother...${prompt};Ah, Sir Iron Eater.
I see.;Ma grand-mère...${prompt}
This sword belonged to your father, Lord Yasin.;Je comprends.
This may even be the sword that he used when...${prompt};Cette épée appartenait à votre père, Lord Yasin.
Sir?;C'est peut-être même l'épée qu'il utilisait quand...${prompt}
You have met my father before?${prompt};Monsieur ?
Once, thirty years ago... But I was still a child.${prompt};Vous avez rencontré mon père auparavant ?${prompt}
Welcome back, Sir Raogrimm!;Une fois, il y a trente ans... Mais j'étais encore un enfant.${prompt}
Did you beat up some Orcs this time?${prompt};Bon retour, Sir Raogrimm !
Pagdako. My mission this time was a simple expedition. There was no “beating up” of any Orcs.${prompt};Vous avez battu des orcs cette fois-ci ?${prompt}
Yeah, but it makes no difference for a hired hand like me. I had me some fun, and found some good material for making a new sword to boot!${prompt};"Pagdako. Ma mission cette fois était une simple expédition. Il n'y avait pas de ""bastonnade"" d'orcs.${prompt}"
We bumped into this other party too... Yeah, some old monk traveling with a cute, feisty young girl.${prompt};Ouais, mais ça ne change rien pour un mercenaire comme moi. Je me suis bien amusé, et j'ai trouvé de bon matériel pour faire une nouvelle épée en prime !${prompt}
I have no interest in the methods you use in “finding” good material, but I do know you are quite a fighter. It is a pity that you waste your talent on adventuring.${prompt};Nous sommes tombés sur un autre groupe aussi... Ouais, un vieux moine voyageant avec une jeune fille mignonne et pleine de tempérament.${prompt}
Oh, please. What adventures await me with the title of Musketeer? Guard duty? Heh, I'm no doorman!${prompt};"Je n'ai aucun intérêt pour les méthodes que vous utilisez pour ""trouver"" du bon matériel, mais je sais que vous êtes un sacré combattant. C'est dommage que vous gaspilliez votre talent en aventures.${prompt}"
You are a strange sort, Yasin.;Oh, s'il vous plaît. Quelles aventures m'attendent avec le titre de Mousquetaire ? La garde ? Hé, je ne suis pas un portier !${prompt}
That material you brought back--I'll have one of my blacksmith companions make it into a sword for you. That will be your payment for your duties this time. Agreed?${prompt};Vous êtes un drôle de personnage, Yasin.
Sounds good to me, Musketeer.${prompt};Le matériel que vous avez ramené - j'aurai un de mes compagnons forgerons le transformer en épée pour vous. Ce sera votre paiement pour vos devoirs cette fois. D'accord ?${prompt}
When I grow up, I wanna be a big, brave Musketeer, just like Sir Raogrimm!${prompt};Ça me va, Mousquetaire.${prompt}
Pagdako, being a Musketeer is not necessarily about going out on missions and fighting monsters. At times, we must deal with enemies who are behind our own walls. If you can handle that burden as well, I believe you will make a fine Musketeer indeed.${prompt};Quand je serai grand, je veux être un grand et brave Mousquetaire, comme Sir Raogrimm !${prompt}
There's no doubt about it. That sword is the one that Sir Raogrimm--the Mythril Musketeer and Galka Talekeeper himself--had made for your father.${prompt};Pagdako, être un Mousquetaire ne consiste pas nécessairement à partir en mission et à combattre des monstres. Parfois, nous devons faire face à des ennemis qui sont derrière nos propres murs. Si vous pouvez aussi supporter ce fardeau, je crois que vous ferez un bon Mousquetaire.${prompt}
Wow... I never knew that my father knew such important people.;Il n'y a aucun doute là-dessus. Cette épée est celle que Sir Raogrimm - le Mousquetaire en Mythril et le Gardien des Contes Galka lui-même - avait faite pour votre père.${prompt}

......;Et Sir Iron Eater, je ne savais pas que votre vrai nom était... comment avez-vous dit, Pacdaco ?${prompt}
Feel free to call me whichever is easiest for you to pronounce. It makes no difference to me. A name is not important, only the man behind it.${prompt};......
Well, thanks for bringing this to me. I'll try to use it as my father did.;N'hésitez pas à m'appeler comme vous le souhaitez. Cela m'est égal. Un nom n'est pas important, seul l'homme derrière l'est.${prompt}
Here, you can have this. It's been used quite a bit, but I'm sure you'll find a good home for it.${prompt};Eh bien, merci de me l'avoir apporté. J'essaierai de l'utiliser comme mon père.

Conquest results.;Conquêtes.
Donating crystals.;Résultats des conquêtes.
Conquest points.;Don de cristaux.
The effects of controlling regions.;Points de conquête.
Regions controlled by other nations.;Les effets de la prise de contrôle des régions.
Regions under beastman control.${prompt};Régions contrôlées par d'autres nations.
All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt};Régions sous le contrôle des bêtes.${prompt}
Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt};"Les trois nations s'efforcent quotidiennement de mettre sous leur contrôle un maximum de régions. C'est ce que nous appelons les ""conquêtes"". Vous pouvez y participer et servir votre pays en vainquant des ennemis lorsque le Sceau est activé sur vous.${prompt}"
Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt};Chaque région comprend plusieurs zones, et la nation qui élimine le plus de monstres dans ces zones prend le contrôle de la région.${prompt}
So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt};Les nations reçoivent des biens et des ressources des régions sous leur contrôle.${prompt}
Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.;Ainsi, plus nous contrôlons de régions, plus notre nation devient riche.${prompt}
They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt};Des gardes-frontières sont également placés dans des avant-postes au sein des régions sous notre contrôle.
Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt};Ils sont là pour lancer le Sceau sur des aventuriers comme vous.${prompt}
Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt};Une fois que vous avez le Sceau de votre nation, vous pourrez obtenir des cristaux des ennemis que vous vainquez.${prompt}
So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.;De plus, vous recevrez des points de conquête. Vous obtenez plus de points de conquête si vous vainquez des ennemis dans des régions qui ne sont pas sous le contrôle de votre nation. Ces points peuvent être utilisés pour acheter des objets auprès de gardes comme moi.${prompt}
We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt};Comme vous le voyez... les conquêtes bénéficient aux nations et aux aventuriers.
You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.;Nous attendons de vous que vous fassiez de votre mieux pour servir votre pays.${prompt}
Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt};"Vous pouvez voir l'état actuel des conquêtes en sélectionnant ""Info Région"" dans le menu principal."
Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.;Les résultats des conquêtes dans toutes les régions sont régulièrement recalculés, donc vous voudrez peut-être les vérifier de temps en temps.${prompt}
The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.${prompt};Les boutiques de notre ville vendront des articles différents en fonction de notre classement en conquête.
You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.;La Troupe Valeriano visitera également la nation qui termine première et apportera un peu de joie à ses citoyens.${prompt}
Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt};Vous pouvez donner des cristaux à votre nation une fois que vous atteignez le rang 2.
We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.;Il vous suffit de les échanger avec des gardes comme moi, et nous nous assurerons qu'ils sont envoyés au bon endroit.${prompt}
Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt};Nous aimerions que vous donniez des cristaux à votre nation à partir de maintenant.
You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.;Il vous suffit de les échanger avec des gardes comme moi, et nous nous assurerons qu'ils sont envoyés au bon endroit.${prompt}
Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt};Vous pouvez obtenir des cristaux en vainquant des ennemis lorsque le Sceau de votre nation est activé sur vous.
Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt};Avoir le Sceau de votre nation activé sur vous est également le seul moyen de participer aux conquêtes.${prompt}
You also receive rank points for completing missions.;Des points de rang vous seront attribués pour chaque cristal que vous donnez, et vous pourriez vous voir proposer de nouvelles missions à mesure que votre rang augmente.${prompt}
Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt};Vous recevez également des points de rang pour avoir terminé des missions.
You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.;Terminez des missions et participez aux conquêtes pour augmenter votre rang et servir votre pays.${prompt}
"Select ""Region Info"" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}";Vous recevez des points de conquête lorsque vous vainquez des monstres tout en participant aux conquêtes.
You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt};"Sélectionnez ""Info Région"" dans le menu pour vérifier votre nombre actuel de points de conquête.${prompt}"
When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt};Vous pouvez acheter des objets auprès de gardes comme moi avec vos points de conquête, mais sachez que le nombre de points que vous dépensez sera déduit de votre total actuel.${prompt}
If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt};Lorsque les résultats de la conquête sont annoncés, on vous dira quel pays contrôle la région dans laquelle vous vous trouvez à ce moment-là. Parfois, les régions peuvent devenir neutres, ou même les bêtes peuvent prendre le contrôle des régions.${prompt}
Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt};Si nous prenons le contrôle d'une région, des gardes frontaliers seront placés dans ses avant-postes pour aider des aventuriers comme vous.${prompt}
Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt};Des marchands y seront également placés, et les biens de cette région trouveront leur chemin vers les magasins locaux ici.${prompt}
Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt};Prendre le contrôle des régions est le principe de base derrière les conquêtes. Nous avons besoin que chacun de vous fasse de son mieux et amène notre nation au sommet du classement.${prompt}
As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt};Bien sûr, parfois nous perdons des régions au profit d'autres nations... donc nous devons essayer de les reprendre avant que les résultats de la conquête suivante ne soient annoncés.${prompt}
But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.${prompt};En guise d'incitation, nous vous attribuerons plus de points de conquête pour avoir vaincu des monstres dans ces régions.${prompt}
Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions.;Mais si nous sommes alliés avec une autre nation, vous ne recevrez que le taux régulier pour avoir vaincu des monstres dans les régions de nos alliés. En revanche, nous vous attribuerons plus de points pour combattre dans les régions de la nation classée en tête.${prompt}
If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.${prompt};Notre principale préoccupation réside dans le fait que les bêtes prennent le contrôle de nos régions.
If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.${prompt};Si trop d'entre nous sont vaincus dans une région, les bêtes en prendront le contrôle.${prompt}
The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.${prompt};Si cela se produit, non seulement c'est un grand coup pour notre fierté, mais vous serez également incapable d'acquérir des cristaux dans cette région.${prompt}
We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.${prompt};Les bêtes sont une menace pour toutes les nations. S'ils prennent le pouvoir, nous devons tous nous unir et chasser ces créatures viles de cette région.${prompt}
There is one outpost in each region. Select “Region Info” from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.${prompt};Nous avons besoin que vous apportiez des fournitures aux gardes de frontière des avant-postes qui sont placés dans les régions sous notre contrôle.${prompt}
Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete.;"Il y a un avant-poste dans chaque région. Sélectionnez ""Infos Région"" dans le menu, et recherchez les zones avec un petit drapeau sur la carte. C'est là qu'ils se trouvent.${prompt}"
Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.${prompt};Voici les fournitures. Il suffit de les donner au garde à l'avant-poste et votre mission sera accomplie.
Where do you wish to take the supplies?;Maintenant, choisissez à quel avant-poste vous voulez aller. Nous offrons des récompenses différentes pour chaque région, alors choisissez avec soin.${prompt}

I would like you to retrieve some of this sumptuous sodium for me.${prompt};Now let me inform you of your next mission. There is a rare type of salt that can only be found in the Vollbow Region.${prompt}
Sir!;I would like you to retrieve some of this sumptuous sodium for me.${prompt}
You are not sending our loyal citizens out on missions to obtain personal items again, are you?${prompt};Sir!
I cannot allow it. A line must be drawn between personal matters and matters of the state!${prompt};You are not sending our loyal citizens out on missions to obtain personal items again, are you?${prompt}
Watch your mouth, soldier! How dare a lowly Musketeer question my judgment!${prompt};I cannot allow it. A line must be drawn between personal matters and matters of the state!${prompt}
I am thinking only of the well-being of the citizens of the Republic... Furthermore, the budget for this mission has already been approved by the Senate.${prompt};Watch your mouth, soldier! How dare a lowly Musketeer question my judgment!${prompt}

That is of no matter, Iron Eater.;You don't know anything about what happened in the Mines District?${prompt}
Senator Alois, this salt you are talking of--if I am not mistaken, it is called ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. I have heard many things of this seasoning.${prompt};That is of no matter, Iron Eater.
Such as, it can slow the hands of aging on the clock of life.${prompt};Senator Alois, this salt you are talking of--if I am not mistaken, it is called ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}. I have heard many things of this seasoning.${prompt}

At this age, I have to think of my health...${prompt};Exactly.
I knew you were only thinking of yourself...${prompt};At this age, I have to think of my health...${prompt}
Ahem.;I knew you were only thinking of yourself...${prompt}
I have heard that the area it is found in is extremely dangerous. Therefore, rather than risking the lives of less experienced adventurers, I thought it would be in our best interest to send one more competent. Say, the one who defeated the Shadow Lord.${prompt};Ahem.
I cannot even believe what I am hearing...${prompt};I have heard that the area it is found in is extremely dangerous. Therefore, rather than risking the lives of less experienced adventurers, I thought it would be in our best interest to send one more competent. Say, the one who defeated the Shadow Lord.${prompt}
Hmmm...;I cannot even believe what I am hearing...${prompt}
That sounds like an excellent idea.${prompt};Hmmm...
What...?${prompt};That sounds like an excellent idea.${prompt}
(Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.)${prompt};What...?${prompt}
Anyway, it does not matter whether you like it or not. The mission has already been approved by the Senate, and this fine adventurer has already accepted it.${prompt};(Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.)${prompt}
${name-player}, you are to travel to Rabao and obtain further details on your task from Dancing Wolf.

Iron Eater, I have a favor to ask of you. Come and see me later.${prompt};${name-player}, you are to travel to Rabao and obtain further details on your task from Dancing Wolf. He has already been sent to investigate the location of the salt.${prompt}
Understood...;Iron Eater, I have a favor to ask of you. Come and see me later.${prompt}
I will trust the judgment of our Talekeeper.${prompt};Understood...
Talekeeper? That sounds so formal...${prompt};I will trust the judgment of our Talekeeper.${prompt}
So, ${name-player}, can I count on your help, too? Don't worry. I won't let this end up as a mere grocery run for our fine senator.${prompt};Talekeeper? That sounds so formal...${prompt}
Did you have this salt inspected by Dancing Wolf before bringing it to me? How am I supposed to know that this is truly ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} if you haven't had it checked?

Yes... This salt will add another five years to my--I mean, our citizens' lives.${prompt};Ah, I've already read the report from the guard in Rabao. I assume you're carrying the salt with you.${prompt}
That sounds wonderful, Alois.${prompt};Yes... This salt will add another five years to my--I mean, our citizens' lives.${prompt}
Well, if it isn't the president's little pet. What business do you have here?${prompt};That sounds wonderful, Alois.${prompt}
I am pleased to know that you will be working hard to make sure that ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} is used to better improve the lives and welfare of the citizens of Bastok.${prompt};Well, if it isn't the president's little pet. What business do you have here?${prompt}
If I find that you have not, I will be sending a bill, covering all expenses, to your company.${prompt};I am pleased to know that you will be working hard to make sure that ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]} is used to better improve the lives and welfare of the citizens of Bastok.${prompt}
Hm? I don't know what you're talking about.${prompt};If I find that you have not, I will be sending a bill, covering all expenses, to your company.${prompt}
I have learned that the funds received for this mission and the further research of the salt have been deposited into one of your companies' accounts.${prompt};Hm? I don't know what you're talking about.${prompt}
If the results of your research are beneficial to the Bastokan Republic, I am sure no one will have any problem with this minute detail.

How...how dare you!${prompt};But you should already know all this. It was announced at last month's senate meeting... Oh wait, if I recall, you were asleep for half of the session.${prompt}
And if you are considering putting pressure on the investigators of this case, you may want to reconsider. I shall personally be heading up the team.${prompt};How...how dare you!${prompt}
Finally, a piece of advice for you, senator. If you really want to live longer, you should cut down on the ${item-plural: 6[2]}.${prompt};And if you are considering putting pressure on the investigators of this case, you may want to reconsider. I shall personally be heading up the team.${prompt}
Why, I...I...${prompt};Finally, a piece of advice for you, senator. If you really want to live longer, you should cut down on the ${item-plural: 6[2]}.${prompt}
And I guess that is that.;Why, I...I...${prompt}
But how did Gumbah know what the senator was really up to...?${prompt};And I guess that is that.
Well, I guess that is of no concern to us.;But how did Gumbah know what the senator was really up to...?${prompt}

However, we may require your services sooner than you expect.${prompt};I commend you on the completion of this mission. You will be informed when your services are again required.${prompt}

Franziska means well, but she's got to loosen up, don't you think?${prompt};Milady!${prompt}
Anyway, you'll never guess who was here just a couple of days ago.${prompt};Franziska means well, but she's got to loosen up, don't you think?${prompt}
I can't believe that my father would even let him near this place...${prompt};Anyway, you'll never guess who was here just a couple of days ago.${prompt}

What did he mean? I haven't done anything worth thanking. I've only caused him pain and trouble.${prompt};“Thank you.”
For someone who has lived more than two hundred years, he's not that good with telling people how he feels. But, you know, I'm kind of happy that he told me what he did...${prompt};What did he mean? I haven't done anything worth thanking. I've only caused him pain and trouble.${prompt}
I've only been on Vana'diel for a tenth of time he has, so I can't really talk about being good at expressing feelings...${prompt};For someone who has lived more than two hundred years, he's not that good with telling people how he feels.

Anyway, once the ice was broken, we started talking about all sorts of stuff.${prompt};I've only been on Vana'diel for a tenth of time he has, so I can't really talk about being good at expressing feelings...${prompt}
For some reason, he seemed really interested in one of Lucius' new programs. I wonder what that was all about?${prompt};Anyway, once the ice was broken, we started talking about all sorts of stuff.${prompt}
Milady!;For some reason, he seemed really interested in one of Lucius' new programs. I wonder what that was all about?${prompt}
It is time for your studies!${prompt};Milady!
Yes, Franziska! I know!${prompt};It is time for your studies!${prompt}
You know, I think I'm going to start putting a little more effort into my studies. I think I finally know what I want to be when I get older.${prompt};Yes, Franziska! I know!${prompt}
What do I want to be? I can't tell you yet. That's still a secret.${prompt};You know, I think I'm going to start putting a little more effort into my studies. I think I finally know what I want to be when I get older.${prompt}
Well, you should probably go before Franziska has Iron Eater drag you out. Thanks for coming and listening to me.${prompt};What do I want to be? I can't tell you yet. That's still a secret.${prompt}
Recently, Lady Cornelia has taken up an interest in her studies. However, how long this will last, I do not know...${prompt};Well, you should probably go before Franziska has Iron Eater drag you out. Thanks for coming and listening to me.${prompt}
We've been waiting for you, ${name-player}. Some unbelievable events have taken place recently...${prompt};Recently, Lady Cornelia has taken up an interest in her studies. However, how long this will last, I do not know...${prompt}
It seems as if the dark knight Zeid attacked one of our adventurers in the Northlands, and forced her to deliver a letter addressed to Captain Volker.${prompt};We've been waiting for you, ${name-player}. Some unbelievable events have taken place recently...${prompt}
Even more unbelievable is the content of that letter...${prompt};It seems as if the dark knight Zeid attacked one of our adventurers in the Northlands, and forced her to deliver a letter addressed to Captain Volker.${prompt}
But enough talking. We should enter the President's Office now.${prompt};Even more unbelievable is the content of that letter...${prompt}
What is the meaning of this!?${prompt};But enough talking. We should enter the President's Office now.${prompt}
Give me one good reason why you were compelled to hide the truth about what my uncle did over thirty years ago!${prompt};What is the meaning of this!?${prompt}
Volker...;Give me one good reason why you were compelled to hide the truth about what my uncle did over thirty years ago!${prompt}
We weren't trying to hide it from you...${prompt};Volker...
Wait...;We weren't trying to hide it from you...${prompt}
You knew about this too?${prompt};Wait...
Knew about...? Well...you see...${prompt};You knew about this too?${prompt}
Oh, and the next thing you'll tell me is that ${name-player} knew all about this as well!${prompt};Knew about...? Well...you see...${prompt}
So the only person who didn't know anything about it was the one with the cursed blood running through his veins! Me!${prompt};Oh, and the next thing you'll tell me is that ${name-player} knew all about this as well!${prompt}
Is that all you've got, Raogrimm!?${prompt};So the only person who didn't know anything about it was the one with the cursed blood running through his veins! Me!${prompt}

...Cornelia!?${prompt};Watch me!
Wh-what have I done!?${prompt};...Cornelia!?${prompt}
I didn't join the Musketeers because of my uncle, but that didn't stop the rumors--the rumors that it was my uncle's influence that got me my position.${prompt};Wh-what have I done!?${prompt}
And so I was promoted to Mythril Musketeer, and then to captain...and what was waiting for me when I finally reached the top? The truth about my uncle and its cover-up! Who am I supposed to believe now!?${prompt};I didn't join the Musketeers because of my uncle, but that didn't stop the rumors--the rumors that it was my uncle's influence that got me my position.${prompt}

What...?${prompt};...Are you done whining, Captain?${prompt}
The only reason we did not inform you of what happened thirty years ago is because we thought you would react like this.${prompt};What...?${prompt}
And look at yourself... Exactly what we expected.;The only reason we did not inform you of what happened thirty years ago is because we thought you would react like this.${prompt}
Or maybe you want us to sit with you and cry over your cursed destiny?${prompt};And look at yourself... Exactly what we expected.
You want us to comfort you and tell you that what happened thirty years ago has nothing to do with the present? Will that make you feel better?${prompt};Or maybe you want us to sit with you and cry over your cursed destiny?${prompt}
It seems that I have overestimated your ability as captain, Volker.${prompt};You want us to comfort you and tell you that what happened thirty years ago has nothing to do with the present? Will that make you feel better?${prompt}
Karst! That wasn't necessary!${prompt};It seems that I have overestimated your ability as captain, Volker.${prompt}
You are no longer of any worth to Bastok. Iron Eater will take your place until we appoint a new captain. Now leave this office.${prompt};Karst! That wasn't necessary!${prompt}
President Karst!${prompt};You are no longer of any worth to Bastok. Iron Eater will take your place until we appoint a new captain. Now leave this office.${prompt}
And while you're gone, why don't you try finding Zeid and bringing him back to Bastok? He'd be a lot more useful around here than you.${prompt};President Karst!${prompt}
Understood.;And while you're gone, why don't you try finding Zeid and bringing him back to Bastok? He'd be a lot more useful around here than you.${prompt}
I will obey your orders.${prompt};Understood.
Captain!${prompt};I will obey your orders.${prompt}
It's all... It's all my fault. I should have told him a long time ago...${prompt};Captain!${prompt}
Hmph! If he couldn't handle that, then he certainly cannot handle the position of captain.${prompt};It's all... It's all my fault. I should have told him a long time ago...${prompt}
${name-player}! You heard what just transpired here. I have a feeling that Zeid's letter was just a ploy to get Volker to meet him.${prompt};Hmph! If he couldn't handle that, then he certainly cannot handle the position of captain.${prompt}
However, by the looks of him, I'm not positive that Volker is ready to meet Zeid's challenge.${prompt};${name-player}! You heard what just transpired here. I have a feeling that Zeid's letter was just a ploy to get Volker to meet him.${prompt}
But we cannot wait for Volker to come to terms with the truth that lies before him. That's why I'm asking you to go capture the dark knight and bring him here.${prompt};However, by the looks of him, I'm not positive that Volker is ready to meet Zeid's challenge.${prompt}
Whether I make him Volker's replacement or throw him in jail is up to me.${prompt};But we cannot wait for Volker to come to terms with the truth that lies before him. That's why I'm asking you to go capture the dark knight and bring him here.${prompt}
President Karst! You cannot do this! Think of what both have done for this country!${prompt};Whether I make him Volker's replacement or throw him in jail is up to me.${prompt}
That's right, Karst! You're not the type to let your feelings control your actions!${prompt};President Karst! You cannot do this! Think of what both have done for this country!${prompt}
I've...;That's right, Karst! You're not the type to let your feelings control your actions!${prompt}

Now that you're all here, I have just one question to ask... Why can't you Mythril Musketeers ever follow orders!?${prompt};Welcome back from Castle Zvahl. You may enter.${prompt}
I thought I told you to bring Zeid back here to Bastok!${prompt};Now that you're all here, I have just one question to ask... Why can't you Mythril Musketeers ever follow orders!?${prompt}
And because you couldn't complete a simple task, what am I left to do? Reinstate this failure of a soldier as captain!?${prompt};I thought I told you to bring Zeid back here to Bastok!${prompt}
President Karst...${prompt};And because you couldn't complete a simple task, what am I left to do? Reinstate this failure of a soldier as captain!?${prompt}
I've heard enough. Leave my office.;President Karst...${prompt}
Find something suitable for the adventurer's reward.${prompt};I've heard enough. Leave my office.
Do you think the president's mad because of us?${prompt};Find something suitable for the adventurer's reward.${prompt}

Oh, do not worry, sir. Knowing the president, I am sure we will be getting a pay cut, or something of the like.${prompt};I thought that we might be punished more severely...${prompt}
A pay cut!? C'mon! I still have sixteen more payments on my loan...${prompt};Oh, do not worry, sir. Knowing the president, I am sure we will be getting a pay cut, or something of the like.${prompt}
Don't tell me you bought another sword...${prompt};A pay cut!? C'mon! I still have sixteen more payments on my loan...${prompt}
I... I don't know how to thank all of you.${prompt};Don't tell me you bought another sword...${prompt}
I can never be Zeid. I don't have the strength to carry the burdens that he does.${prompt};I... I don't know how to thank all of you.${prompt}
However, I have come to realize that there are some things that only I can accomplish.${prompt};I can never be Zeid. I don't have the strength to carry the burdens that he does.${prompt}
While there are many truths that can be seen while within the boundaries of a nation, there are some things that can only be viewed once one has left their native soil.${prompt};However, I have come to realize that there are some things that only I can accomplish.${prompt}
That is why adventurers such as yourself are of great importance to our country.${prompt};While there are many truths that can be seen while within the boundaries of a nation, there are some things that can only be viewed once one has left their native soil.${prompt}
This is your reward, ${name-player}. And with it I present to you our nation's highest honor: rank 10.${prompt};That is why adventurers such as yourself are of great importance to our country.${prompt}
I cannot begin to count the number of times I have thanked you for your services, but...thank you.${prompt};This is your reward, ${name-player}. And with it I present to you our nation's highest honor: rank 10.${prompt}

Oh yeah, I almost forgot. There's a letter for you.${prompt};Some ${choice-player-gender}[guys/girls] have all the luck... You? You get a reward. Me? I get a pay cut!${prompt}
Here. You'll know who it's from when you read it.${prompt};Oh yeah, I almost forgot. There's a letter for you.${prompt}
Dear ${name-player},${wait-36: 1};Here. You'll know who it's from when you read it.${prompt}
“Do you really like Bastok?”${prompt};Dear ${name-player},${wait-36: 1}
I...;“Do you really like Bastok?”${prompt}
I hated my country.${prompt};I...
A country ruled by gil...;I hated my country.${prompt}
A country where people don't care about anyone but themselves...${prompt};A country ruled by gil...
I tried to change it, but with each passing day, I came to think that maybe I really was powerless against the system.${prompt};A country where people don't care about anyone but themselves...${prompt}
But recently I've met a lot of different people, and I've come to realize that I'm not as powerless as I thought.${prompt};I tried to change it, but with each passing day, I came to think that maybe I really was powerless against the system.${prompt}
And that's why I've decided to listen to the voice of the people and ask them, “Do you really like Bastok?”${prompt};But recently I've met a lot of different people, and I've come to realize that I'm not as powerless as I thought.${prompt}
As a matter of fact, I've already started asking. Here's what they had to say...${prompt};And that's why I've decided to listen to the voice of the people and ask them, “Do you really like Bastok?”${prompt}
You sure do ask the strangest things, Cornelia.${prompt};As a matter of fact, I've already started asking. Here's what they had to say...${prompt}
Hmmm, well...;You sure do ask the strangest things, Cornelia.${prompt}
I haven't had the easiest life here in Bastok, but I don't think I could have pursued my dream anywhere else.${prompt};Hmmm, well...
It may sound strange, but being in this country gives you the confidence to tell everybody, “I'll show you!”${prompt};I haven't had the easiest life here in Bastok, but I don't think I could have pursued my dream anywhere else.${prompt}
Of course. I am proud to say that I was born and raised in Bastok.${prompt};It may sound strange, but being in this country gives you the confidence to tell everybody, “I'll show you!”${prompt}
Even though we are surrounded by malms of desert, I can still get all the ingredients I need for my family's meals.${prompt};Of course. I am proud to say that I was born and raised in Bastok.${prompt}
I think that this can only come from the freedom that this nation is built on.${prompt};Even though we are surrounded by malms of desert, I can still get all the ingredients I need for my family's meals.${prompt}
Some may criticize the money-hungry ways of the merchants and adventurers, but without them, where would Bastok be today?${prompt};I think that this can only come from the freedom that this nation is built on.${prompt}
My only trouble is trying to decide what to make for dinner. I'd say that is a fairly carefree life.${prompt};Some may criticize the money-hungry ways of the merchants and adventurers, but without them, where would Bastok be today?${prompt}
What the hell kind of question is that? How could I like a country where Humes have stepped on us Galka for hundreds of years!?${prompt};My only trouble is trying to decide what to make for dinner. I'd say that is a fairly carefree life.${prompt}
The bridge between our people cannot be built in a day. But if we do not try, the spirits of our ancestors can never rest.${prompt};What the hell kind of question is that? How could I like a country where Humes have stepped on us Galka for hundreds of years!?${prompt}
Everyone knows we must change our ways, but that is often easier said than done.${prompt};The bridge between our people cannot be built in a day. But if we do not try, the spirits of our ancestors can never rest.${prompt}
Love, hate... Does it really matter?${prompt};Everyone knows we must change our ways, but that is often easier said than done.${prompt}
But when people try to live their lives without taking the rules that have been laid down before them, there are bound to be some problems.${prompt};Love, hate... Does it really matter?${prompt}
I guess that's what you call “responsibility.” You know, that word wasn't used that much by the ancient Galka.${prompt};But when people try to live their lives without taking the rules that have been laid down before them, there are bound to be some problems.${prompt}
Nobody really questioned the responsibility of the Talekeeper, just as no one really questions the responsibility of the gods.${prompt};I guess that's what you call “responsibility.” You know, that word wasn't used that much by the ancient Galka.${prompt}
If you are going to leave everything up to one person, responsibility is obsolete. However, if you try living in a community...${prompt};Nobody really questioned the responsibility of the Talekeeper, just as no one really questions the responsibility of the gods.${prompt}
Now, if you, too, would start taking some responsibility...${prompt};If you are going to leave everything up to one person, responsibility is obsolete. However, if you try living in a community...${prompt}
Hey, you don't have to get that upset...!${prompt};Now, if you, too, would start taking some responsibility...${prompt}
If I had no feelings for this country, I would probably still be refining my skills in Norg...${prompt};Hey, you don't have to get that upset...!${prompt}
But I feel that it is my duty to protect this nation. It may sound simple, but it is what drives me.${prompt};If I had no feelings for this country, I would probably still be refining my skills in Norg...${prompt}
I just wanted a place where I could conduct my experiments...${prompt};But I feel that it is my duty to protect this nation. It may sound simple, but it is what drives me.${prompt}
I never thought they would make me so important. Ha ha.${prompt};I just wanted a place where I could conduct my experiments...${prompt}
