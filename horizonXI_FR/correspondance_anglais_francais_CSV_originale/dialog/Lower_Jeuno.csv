Aldo...${prompt};Vous aurez besoin de ceci pour entrer dans Beadeaux.${prompt}
What is it, Verena? Can't you see I have a guest?${prompt};Aldo...${prompt}
I know. That's what it's about.${prompt};Qu'est-ce que c'est, Verena ? Ne vois-tu pas que j'ai un invité ?${prompt}
I heard that the archduke has made a statement...${prompt};Je sais. C'est à propos de ça.${prompt}
He's ordered all beastmen out of Jeuno. He must not think it's safe to have them around anymore.${prompt};J'ai entendu dire que l'archiduc a fait une déclaration...${prompt}
What? I think those creeps in the palace are a lot worse than any beastmen we have here!${prompt};Il a ordonné à toutes les bêtes de Jeuno de partir. Il doit penser que ce n'est plus sûr de les avoir ici.${prompt}
It's like they're wearing masks...you can't tell what they're thinking. And their eyes are like cold stones. You're not gonna follow that order, are you?${prompt};Quoi ? Je pense que ces idiots dans le palais sont bien pires que n'importe quelle bête que nous avons ici !${prompt}
Well, I know how you feel, but with beastmen on the rampage out there, you can't blame people for feeling jittery about the ones in here.${prompt};C'est comme s'ils portaient des masques... on ne peut pas savoir ce qu'ils pensent. Et leurs yeux sont comme des pierres froides. Tu ne vas pas suivre cet ordre, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
You've heard about all that, haven't you?${prompt};Eh bien, je comprends ce que tu ressens, mais avec les bêtes qui font des ravages là-bas, on ne peut pas blâmer les gens de se sentir nerveux à propos de celles qui sont ici.${prompt}
Yeah, I've heard. But the beastmen in town haven't ever hurt anybody!${prompt};Tu as entendu parler de tout ça, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
I know that, Verena... But I don't think the average Jeunoan would agree.${prompt};Oui, j'ai entendu. Mais les bêtes en ville n'ont jamais fait de mal à personne !${prompt}
No...${prompt};Je le sais, Verena... Mais je ne pense pas que le Jeunoan moyen serait d'accord.${prompt}
Maybe it's the wise thing to do. You know, taking action before things get out of hand.${prompt};Non...${prompt}
Well, I'll see if I can think up a better alternative. Don't worry. I'd be the last guy to chase them out of town.${prompt};Peut-être que c'est la chose sage à faire. Vous savez, agir avant que les choses ne dégénèrent.${prompt}
Okay. You promised, remember!${prompt};Eh bien, je verrai si je peux penser à une meilleure alternative. Ne vous inquiétez pas. Je serais le dernier à les chasser de la ville.${prompt}
Verena...${prompt};D'accord. Vous avez promis, souvenez-vous-en !${prompt}
Fickie!${prompt};Verena...${prompt}
Oh!${wait-animation: 1}${prompt};Fickie !${prompt}
Fickie... Are you all right?${prompt};Oh !${wait-animation: 1}${prompt}
That's a weird thing to ask. I'm always all right. How about you? You look pale!${prompt};Fickie... Ça va ?${prompt}
Oh, um... No. No, I'm fine.${prompt};C'est bizarre de poser cette question. Je vais toujours bien. Et vous ? Vous avez l'air pâle !${prompt}
Oh, all right. Well, let's get going!${prompt};Oh, euh... Non. Non, ça va.${prompt}
Um, okay.${prompt};Oh, très bien. Eh bien, allons-y !${prompt}
Magicite is found deep inside Castle Oztroja, Davoi, and Beadeaux. Those places are thick with murderous beastmen, and their traps are cunning.${prompt};Euh, d'accord.${prompt}
There's not a rumor that doesn't find its way to Jeuno. I bet you can find what you need from other adventurers. May your strength never falter!${prompt};La magicite se trouve au fin fond du château d'Oztroja, de Davoi et de Beadeaux. Ces endroits sont infestés de bêtes meurtrières, et leurs pièges sont rusés.${prompt}
What? You say the beastmen might be plotting something else? Yeah, it wouldn't be like them to just give up.${prompt};Aucune rumeur n'échappe à Jeuno. Je parie que vous pouvez trouver ce dont vous avez besoin auprès d'autres aventuriers. Que votre force ne défaille jamais !${prompt}
I don't want anything to do with beastmen anymore. I bet the old Goblin Muckvix knows more, but you'd have to ask him yourself.${prompt};Quoi ? Vous dites que les bêtes pourraient comploter quelque chose d'autre ? Ouais, ça ne serait pas dans leurs habitudes de simplement abandonner.${prompt}
Verena's really worried about Fickblix. Better not mention beastmen around her.${prompt};Je ne veux plus avoir affaire aux bêtes. Je parie que le vieux Goblin Muckvix en sait plus, mais vous devrez lui demander vous-même.${prompt}
I wonder who's worse, us or them? Fickie's never done anything bad at all.${prompt};Verena est vraiment inquiète pour Fickblix. Mieux vaut ne pas mentionner les bêtes en sa présence.${prompt}
Just 'cause they're not human doesn't mean we should hate them. Even a kid like Fickie gets treated like dirt.${prompt};Je me demande qui est pire, nous ou eux ? Fickie n'a jamais fait de mal à personne.${prompt}
I don't know what's right or wrong anymore. I can't help anybody. I'm sorry.${prompt};Juste parce qu'ils ne sont pas humains ne veut pas dire que nous devrions les détester. Même un enfant comme Fickie est traité comme de la saleté.${prompt}
What? Fickie's seeds started to grow? Hey, what's that gotta do with me, huh?${prompt};Je ne sais plus ce qui est juste ou faux. Je ne peux aider personne. Je suis désolé.${prompt}
'Course I don't like war. But that ain't the same thing.${prompt};Quoi ? Les graines de Fickie ont commencé à pousser ? Hé, qu'est-ce que ça a à voir avec moi, hein ?${prompt}
Hey, I'm a beastie. I ain't tellin' you zilch if it'd hurt my peoples.${prompt};Bien sûr que j’aime pas la guerre. Mais ça veut pas dire la même chose.${prompt}
So, Fickblix's seeds started to sprout...${prompt};Hé, je suis une bestiole. Je vous dis rien si ça blesse mes gens.${prompt}
Aldo, I...${prompt};Alors, les graines de Fickblix ont commencé à germer...${prompt}
Verena, I heard your flowers started to sprout. I bet all you kids gave it lots of water. That kind of seed doesn't take root that easily.${prompt};Aldo, je...${prompt}
Maybe everything you and Fickblix acomplished really did mean something.${prompt};Verena, j'ai entendu dire que vos fleurs ont commencé à pousser. Je parie que vous les avez arrosées généreusement, tous les enfants. Ce genre de graine ne prend pas racine si facilement.${prompt}
Recently I... I haven't been watering it. I thought of nothing but myself. I'm so sorry, Fickie.${prompt};Peut-être que tout ce que vous et Fickblix avez accompli signifie vraiment quelque chose.${prompt}
Yeah, maybe it's not a question of what's right and what's wrong.${prompt};Récemment, je... Je ne l'ai pas arrosé. Je n'ai pensé qu'à moi-même. Je suis tellement désolé, Fickie.${prompt}
Nothing would be better than averting another conflict... For us, and for them.${prompt};Oui, peut-être que ce n'est pas une question de ce qui est bien et ce qui est mal.${prompt}
All right! I don't know what we can do, but I'll help. Fickie would never forgive us if we just stood silent.${prompt};Rien ne serait mieux que d'éviter un autre conflit... Pour nous, et pour eux.${prompt}
That's right! The least we can do is try.${prompt};D'accord ! Je ne sais pas ce que nous pouvons faire, mais j'aiderai. Fickie ne nous pardonnerait jamais si nous restions silencieux.${prompt}
But I don't know if we can find out what their little group is up to.${prompt};C'est vrai ! Le moins que nous puissions faire, c'est essayer.${prompt}
I guess we could ask Muckvix.${prompt};Mais je ne sais pas si nous pouvons découvrir ce que leur petit groupe manigance.${prompt}
But would he help? He always tries to stay out of these racial matters.${prompt};Je suppose que nous pourrions demander à Muckvix.${prompt}
And if he told us anything, he'd be betraying his own kind.${prompt};Mais est-ce qu'il aiderait ? Il essaie toujours de rester en dehors de ces affaires raciales.${prompt}
Yeah, I know. But there's nothing else we can do. ${name-player}, would you mind asking Muckvix? We'll head there later.${prompt};Et s'il nous disait quelque chose, il trahirait les siens.${prompt}
Hey, I ain't got nuttin' to say to ya. Scram.${prompt};Ouais, je sais. Mais il n'y a rien d'autre que nous puissions faire. ${name-player}, est-ce que ça vous dérangerait de demander à Muckvix ? Nous irons là-bas plus tard.${prompt}
We need your help, too, Muckvix.${prompt};Hé, j'ai rien à vous dire. Dégagez.${prompt}
Oh, so you're in this too, huh? Whaddaya tryin' to pull here?${prompt};Nous avons aussi besoin de votre aide, Muckvix.${prompt}
Please, Muck. You're our only hope. Jeuno--no, the entire world is in danger unless you tell us.${prompt};Oh, donc vous êtes là-dedans aussi, hein ? Qu'est-ce que vous essayez de faire ?${prompt}
Hey, I've been livin' here for ages, but when it comes down to it, I'm just a beastie, ain't I?${prompt};S'il te plaît, Muck. Tu es notre seul espoir. Jeuno - non, le monde entier est en danger à moins que tu ne nous dises.${prompt}
You ain't gonna get nuttin' outta me. See, we beasties are all brudders.${prompt};Hé, je vis ici depuis des lustres, mais quand ça compte vraiment, je ne suis qu'une bestiole, pas vrai ?${prompt}
Muck, you don't think of us as your own, but those kids and I helped Fickie's seeds grow... To us, people and beastmen are the same. We're all one and the same!${prompt};Vous n'allez rien obtenir de moi. Voyez-vous, nous les bestioles, nous sommes tous frères.${prompt}
And now, the chance for peace is in danger. Please, Muck, tell us!${prompt};Muck, tu ne nous considères pas comme les tiens, mais ces enfants et moi avons aidé les graines de Fickie à pousser... Pour nous, les gens et les bêtes sont les mêmes. Nous sommes tous un et le même !${prompt}
Chance for peace, huh? Aw, that Fickie... What would he do if he was here?${prompt};Et maintenant, la chance pour la paix est en danger. S'il te plaît, Muck, dis-nous !${prompt}
Aw, what the hell. But just this once! And only 'cause I owe your father. May my peoples forgive me...${prompt};La chance pour la paix, hein ? Oh, ce Fickie... Que ferait-il s'il était ici ?${prompt}
Okay, so the crew you're lookin' for's always been kinda cold to us.${prompt};Oh, bon sang. Mais juste cette fois ! Et seulement parce que je dois ça à ton père. Que mes gens me pardonnent...${prompt}
They're just a bunch of tough guys, but sometimes they go buck wild. I heard they're growin' into a big mob, so they must be up to somethin'!${prompt};D'accord, donc l'équipage que vous cherchez a toujours été un peu froid envers nous.${prompt}
Try lookin' around the Eldieme Necropolis. I heard the bums who left Davoi are layin' low there. And I ain't gonna say nuttin' more!${prompt};Ce ne sont que des durs à cuire, mais parfois ils deviennent fous. J'ai entendu dire qu'ils devenaient une grande bande, donc ils doivent être en train de préparer quelque chose !${prompt}
Thanks, Muck!${prompt};Essayez de regarder autour du Nécropole d'Eldieme. J'ai entendu dire que les clochards qui ont quitté Davoi se cachent là-bas. Et je ne vais pas en dire plus !${prompt}
Muckvix, thanks a million.${prompt};Merci, Muck !${prompt}
I am Zauko. I patrol Lower Jeuno.${prompt};Muckvix, mille mercis.${prompt}
We guards need more than muscle. We need the residents' trust.${prompt};Je suis Zauko. Je patrouille dans le Bas-Jeuno.${prompt}
Come see me if you're ever in trouble.${prompt};Nous, les gardes, avons besoin de plus que de la force. Nous avons besoin de la confiance des résidents.${prompt}
Oh, I meant to tell you.;Venez me voir si vous êtes jamais en difficulté.${prompt}
If you're interested in helping out on a regular basis, I have something for you.${prompt};Oh, j'ai oublié de vous dire.
It's ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}.;Si vous êtes intéressé à aider régulièrement, j'ai quelque chose pour vous.${prompt}
If you have this with you in Lower Jeuno, you'll know when I'm looking for someone to light the lamps.${prompt};C'est ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}.
How about it? You can always give it back when you get tired of hearing the announcement. Go ahead, take it.${prompt};Si vous l'avez avec vous dans le Bas-Jeuno, vous saurez quand je cherche quelqu'un pour allumer les lampes.${prompt}
Take the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}?;Qu'en dites-vous ? Vous pouvez toujours le rendre quand vous en aurez assez d'entendre l'annonce. Allez-y, prenez-le.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Take the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}?
Sure, why not?;${selection-lines}
No thanks.${prompt};Sure, why not?
That's the spirit. Can never have enough volunteers ready to keep the streets of Jeuno out of the dark.${prompt};No thanks.${prompt}
I see...;That's the spirit. Can never have enough volunteers ready to keep the streets of Jeuno out of the dark.${prompt}
Well, come back if you change your mind.;I see...

So what do you think of the ${keyitem-singular: 7[2]}?;Can never have enough volunteers ready to keep the streets of Jeuno out of the dark.${prompt}

${selection-lines};I think I'll...
...hang on to it.;${selection-lines}

Sure, no problem.;...give it back now.${prompt}
Be sure to lend a hand when the sun goes down.${prompt};Sure, no problem.
Well, I hate to lose one of my volunteers.;Be sure to lend a hand when the sun goes down.${prompt}
Speak to me again if you ever miss lamp-lighting duty.${prompt};Well, I hate to lose one of my volunteers.
You return the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};Speak to me again if you ever miss lamp-lighting duty.${prompt}
Darkness falls soon. It's time to light the lamps. Maybe you could help? I could always use a hand.${prompt};Vous rendez le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Soon darkness falls. It's time to light the lamps. Do you want to help me again?${prompt};La nuit tombe bientôt. Il est temps d'allumer les lampes. Peut-être pourriez-vous aider ? J'aurais toujours besoin d'un coup de main.${prompt}
Will you help out?;Bientôt la nuit tombe. Il est temps d'allumer les lampes. Voulez-vous m'aider à nouveau ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Allez-vous aider ?
Of course.;${selection-lines}
No, not now.${prompt};Bien sûr.
Don't worry. It's easy. See the twelve lamps on the sea side? Just light them for me.${prompt};Non, pas maintenant.${prompt}
It's no big task, but seeing the streets lit up at night brings warmth to my heart.${prompt};Ne vous inquiétez pas. C'est facile. Voyez les douze lampes du côté de la mer ? Il vous suffit de les allumer pour moi.${prompt}
Heh. Poetic, isn't it? Well, you better get started. Try to finish before one in the morning.${prompt};Ce n'est pas une grande tâche, mais voir les rues éclairées la nuit réchauffe mon cœur.${prompt}
Light the twelve lamps facing the ocean. I know you've done it before, but try to finish by one in the morning.${prompt};Heh. Poétique, n'est-ce pas ? Eh bien, vous feriez mieux de commencer. Essayez de finir avant une heure du matin.${prompt}
Oh? It's not hard. Come back if you change your mind.${prompt};Allumez les douze lampes qui font face à l'océan. Je sais que vous l'avez déjà fait, mais essayez de finir avant une heure du matin.${prompt}
Sorry. I already have a helper tonight. Maybe tomorrow.${prompt};Oh ? Ce n'est pas difficile. Revenez si vous changez d'avis.${prompt}
It's too early. Lights on at nine o'clock.${prompt};Désolé. J'ai déjà un assistant ce soir. Peut-être demain.${prompt}
Now you can begin. Do your best to finish by one o'clock. Thank you for your cooperation.${prompt};Il est trop tôt. Les lumières s'allument à neuf heures.${prompt}
Good work. I can't pay you, but I hope you found the experience rewarding.${prompt};Maintenant, vous pouvez commencer. Faites de votre mieux pour terminer avant une heure du matin. Merci pour votre coopération.${prompt}
Good work. It's rewarding each and every time, isn't it? You know I can't pay you, but I'm always glad to see people come back.${prompt};Bon travail. Je ne peux pas vous payer, mais j'espère que vous avez trouvé l'expérience enrichissante.${prompt}
Next time you come to Jeuno, think of the special evening when you gave light to its streets.${prompt};Bon travail. C'est toujours gratifiant, n'est-ce pas ? Vous savez que je ne peux pas vous payer, mais je suis toujours heureux de voir les gens revenir.${prompt}
And if the lamps happen to be lit then, it means that others are doing their best for Jeuno. You'd make me happy if you remember that.${prompt};La prochaine fois que vous viendrez à Jeuno, pensez à cette soirée spéciale où vous avez illuminé ses rues.${prompt}
I am disappointed. Stay sharp next time.${prompt};Et si les lampes sont allumées alors, cela signifie que d'autres font de leur mieux pour Jeuno. Cela me ferait plaisir que vous vous en souveniez.${prompt}
Ahh, there's nothing like city streets lit up at night.${prompt};Je suis déçu. Soyez plus attentif la prochaine fois.${prompt}
The lamps were lit by ${entity: 0} today. If you happen to run across the person who took time out to bring light to our city, don't forget to say a word of thanks.${prompt};Ahh, rien de tel que les rues de la ville éclairées la nuit.${prompt}
Sorry. I'm busy.${prompt};Les lampes ont été allumées par ${entity: 0} aujourd’hui. Si vous croisez la personne qui a pris le temps d’apporter de la lumière à notre ville, n’oubliez pas de lui dire merci.${prompt}
It seems too early to light the lamps.${prompt};Désolé, je suis occupé.${prompt}
Light the lamp?;Il semble trop tôt pour allumer les lampes.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Allumer la lampe ?
Yes.;${selection-lines}
No.${prompt};Oui.

You have failed to light all the lamps in time.${prompt};Il est trop tôt pour l'allumer. Vous devez attendre neuf heures.${prompt}
Zauko is recruiting an adventurer to light the lamps.${prompt};Vous n'avez pas réussi à allumer toutes les lampes à temps.${prompt}
What? They're going to tear down the clock tower? Not if I can help it. What could they be thinking?${prompt};Zauko recrute un aventurier pour allumer les lampes.${prompt}
Damn the politicians! Of course I'll sign.${prompt};Quoi ? Ils vont démolir la tour de l'horloge ? Pas si je peux l'empêcher. Que peuvent-ils bien penser ?${prompt}
Good luck with those signatures!${prompt};Maudits politiciens ! Bien sûr que je vais signer.${prompt}
Hm? Oh, I thought you were Two. He should be back any minutaru...${prompt};Bonne chance pour ces signatures !${prompt}
Two should be back soon. He's so handy-dandy!${prompt};Hm ? Oh, je pensais que tu étais Two. Il devrait revenir d'une minutaru...${prompt}

You're all bark and no bite.${prompt};Hahoho !${prompt}
Whatever-wever!${prompt};Vous aboyez beaucoup mais vous ne mordez pas.${prompt}
Well, I'd best start fixing something. Today we're having Tarutaru soup. I have to boil it in ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}! It's good food, I say!${prompt};Peu importe !${prompt}
But I don't see it anywhere! Oh, dear... Where could it be?${prompt};Well, I'd best start fixing something. Today we're having Tarutaru soup. I have to boil it in ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}! It's good food, I say!${prompt}

I salvaged that Cardian when Panta was just a cub. We didn't think he'd make it, but somehow he started up.${prompt};Dangit, I need that soup pot if I'm going to beat him. How can I get another-wother one...${prompt}

Hey, we're fixin' up some stew. Gobbie food's good food!${prompt};...D’accord, mais juste cette fois.${prompt}
I knew that wild chocobos smell, but even domesticated ones reek terribly!${prompt};Hé, nous cuisinons un ragoût. La nourriture gobeline, c'est de la bonne nourriture !${prompt}
Don't say thataru! The chocobo'll get mad.${prompt};Je savais que les chocobos sauvages sentent mauvais, mais même les domestiqués puent terriblement !${prompt}
Nonsense! Chocobos cannot understand us.${prompt};Ne dis pas ça ! Le chocobo va se fâcher.${prompt}
Uh-oh...${prompt};N'importe quoi ! Les chocobos ne peuvent pas nous comprendre.${prompt}
What is it?${prompt};Oh-oh...${prompt}
Yaaah!${prompt};Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?${prompt}
Why, that chocobo bit me! Curse him and all his flock!${prompt};Yaaah !${prompt}
I like how chocobos smell.${prompt};Pourquoi, ce chocobo m'a mordu ! Maudissez-le, lui et tout son troupeau !${prompt}
That man from the chocobo corral sure was scary.${prompt};J'aime l'odeur des chocobos.${prompt}
He started yelling at the chocobos for no reason. I'm sure they were terrified of him.${prompt};Cet homme de l'enclos à chocobos était vraiment effrayant.${prompt}
But he obviously loves his son a lot. How strange...${prompt};Il a commencé à crier sur les chocobos pour aucune raison. Je suis sûr qu'ils étaient terrifiés par lui.${prompt}
I heard that poor chocobo master's son got sick. Now he's got to watch over both his son and his chocobos. Poor guy...${prompt};Mais il aime évidemment beaucoup son fils. C'est étrange...${prompt}
Did you hear? He lost his wife after she got sick a long time ago. He was so poor, he couldn't afford any medicine for her.${prompt};J'ai entendu dire que le pauvre fils du maître chocobo était tombé malade. Maintenant, il doit veiller sur son fils et ses chocobos. Pauvre type...${prompt}
He got so scary after she died.${prompt};Tu as entendu ? Il a perdu sa femme après qu'elle soit tombée malade il y a longtemps. Il était si pauvre qu'il ne pouvait pas se permettre de lui acheter des médicaments.${prompt}
I heard that the chocobo master's son got better. Sometimes I hear him laughing again.${prompt};Il est devenu si effrayant après sa mort.${prompt}
I'm so surprised. That chocobo master doesn't get angry at the chocobos anymore. I hope he stays that way forever.${prompt};J'ai entendu dire que le fils du maître chocobo allait mieux. Parfois, je l'entends rire à nouveau.${prompt}
Yeah, really!${prompt};Je suis tellement surpris. Ce maître chocobo ne s'énerve plus contre les chocobos. J'espère qu'il restera ainsi pour toujours.${prompt}
This leads straight to the pier, where we launch ships overseas.${prompt};Oui, vraiment !${prompt}
Our boss has dreamed of sailing all over the world. To him, this business is just something he promised his dad he'd do.${prompt};Ce chemin mène droit vers le quai, où nous lançons des navires à l'étranger.${prompt}
Oh, you want ${keyitem-article: 6[2]}, do ya? Sorry, but we ain't comfortable doin' business with ya. Come back once you've made a name for yourself.${prompt};Notre patron rêve de naviguer partout dans le monde. Pour lui, cette entreprise est simplement quelque chose qu'il a promis à son père de faire.${prompt}
So, you're looking for ${keyitem-article: 6[2]}? Beastmen have all the trade routes shut tight for now.${prompt};Oh, tu veux ${keyitem-article: 6[2]}, hein ? Désolé, mais nous ne sommes pas à l’aise de faire affaire avec toi. Reviens une fois que tu t’es fait un nom.${prompt}
But not Tenshodo! We always got the hard-to-find goods in stock. Come on, let's make a deal.${prompt};Alors, tu cherches ${keyitem-article: 6[2]} ? Les bêtes bloquent tous les itinéraires commerciaux pour l’instant.${prompt}
Right now, we're looking for ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}. Get us one, and the ${keyitem-singular: 6[2]} is yours. Whaddaya say?${prompt};Mais pas Tenshodo ! Nous avons toujours en stock les marchandises difficiles à trouver. Allez, faisons affaire.${prompt}
Well, look what we have here... Alrighty, here you go, pal!${prompt};En ce moment, nous cherchons ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}. Apporte-nous-en un, et le ${keyitem-singular: 6[2]} est à toi. Qu’est-ce que tu en dis ?${prompt}
Hey, have you seen Lady Verena around? She usually doesn't stay out this late...${prompt};Eh bien, regarde ce que nous avons ici... D'accord, voilà, mon pote !${prompt}
Lion came, so something must be up. I'd like to get out there and do some fighting myself, but I'm stuck here until Boss gives the order.${prompt};Hé, as-tu vu Lady Verena quelque part ? Elle ne reste généralement pas dehors aussi tard...${prompt}
I couldn't believe it when Boss came back carrying Lady Verena. He looked like he had been run over by a stampede of chocobos.${prompt};Lion est venu, donc quelque chose doit se tramer. J'aimerais sortir là-bas et me battre moi-même, mais je suis coincé ici jusqu'à ce que le Boss donne l'ordre.${prompt}
I wonder what the hell happened up there at Delkfutt's Tower... No, on second thought, don't tell me. I don't want to know.${prompt};Je n'arrivais pas à croire quand le Boss est revenu en portant Lady Verena. Il avait l'air d'avoir été écrasé par un troupeau de chocobos.${prompt}
Lately, Boss has got that look in his eyes... You know, the one that makes your spine tingle with fear.${prompt};Je me demande ce qui s'est passé là-haut à la Tour de Delkfutt... Non, à y réfléchir, ne me le dis pas. Je ne veux pas le savoir.${prompt}
Well, all's well that ends well.;Dernièrement, le patron a ce regard dans les yeux... Vous savez, celui qui vous fait frissonner de peur.${prompt}
I like you and all, but just between you and me, I'm against you joining us. I don't want to have to compete against an adventurer of your caliber!${prompt};Tout est bien qui finit bien.
Watch your back. Our boss, Aldo, is a rrreal pirate. I can be quite a scoundrel, too, but I ain't nothing compared to him.${prompt};Je t'aime bien et tout, mais entre nous, je suis contre le fait que tu te joignes à nous. Je ne veux pas avoir à me mesurer à un aventurier de ton calibre!${prompt}
You follow me, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady]? Whenever Aldo's deep in thought, it's best to just look the other way.${prompt};Surveillez vos arrières. Notre patron, Aldo, est un vrai pirate. Je peux être un sacré vaurien aussi, mais je ne suis rien comparé à lui.${prompt}
After all, he's seen hell with those eyes. Of course, lots of people suffered in the wars twenty years ago, but most of them never came back.${prompt};Vous me suivez, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame]? Quand Aldo est perdu dans ses pensées, il vaut mieux regarder ailleurs.${prompt}
Somehow Verena seems different than the other girls. Some folks say she can rrread animals' minds.${prompt};Après tout, il a vu l'enfer de ses propres yeux. Bien sûr, beaucoup de gens ont souffert pendant les guerres il y a vingt ans, mais la plupart d'entre eux ne sont jamais revenus.${prompt}
She's a fine chocobo rrrider, and unlike my boss, she gets along fine with those beastmen. Those two always fight about that.${prompt};D'une certaine manière, Verena semble différente des autres filles. Certains disent qu'elle peut lire les pensées des animaux.${prompt}
Hey, you made it through! Thanks for the package. Now, go back and get paid.${prompt};C'est une excellente cavalière de chocobo, et contrairement à mon patron, elle s'entend bien avec les hommes-bêtes. Ces deux-là se disputent toujours à ce sujet.${prompt}
Hey, you made it through! But look at this junk. It's trash! Next time go easier on the goods, okay?${prompt};Hé, tu as réussi ! Merci pour le colis. Maintenant, retourne te faire payer.${prompt}
You have completed your delivery of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};Hé, tu as réussi ! Mais regarde cette camelote. C'est de la poubelle ! La prochaine fois, prends plus soin des marchandises, d'accord ?${prompt}
Due to extensive damage, the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} are thrown away.${prompt};Vous avez complété la livraison de ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Hey, did you hear? Verena is missing and our boss is in a mess over it. If you ask me, I think they just had another one of their sibling quarrels.${prompt};En raison des dégâts importants, ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} sont jetés.${prompt}
The other day when Lion came, she was in and out of here like a white rrrabbit on a full moon. I wonder what she could be up to?${prompt};Hé, tu as entendu ? Verena a disparu et notre patron est dans tous ses états à cause de ça. Si tu veux mon avis, je pense qu'ils ont juste eu une autre de leurs querelles fraternelles.${prompt}
Verena was at Delkfutt's Tower!? And I thought that she and the boss had just had a fight... Boy, am I an idiot!${prompt};L'autre jour, quand Lion est venue, elle est entrée et sortie d'ici comme un lapin blanc par une nuit de pleine lune. Je me demande ce qu'elle mijote ?${prompt}
Boss is talking about setting off on some adventure. You're going too, aren't you? It must be something rrreally big if they didn't ask me to come along.${prompt};Verena était à la tour de Delkfutt!? Et moi qui pensais qu'elle et le patron s'étaient juste disputés... Quel idiot je suis !${prompt}
I can't do much for you, but good luck out there. Wouldn't want to see you lose any of your nine lives.${prompt};Le patron parle de partir à l'aventure. Tu y vas aussi, n'est-ce pas ? Ça doit être quelque chose de vraiment gros s'ils ne m'ont pas demandé de venir.${prompt}
Welcome back. From the looks of it, you had a pretty tough time out there... But that's about all I know. Boss never tells us about anything that goes on...${prompt};Je ne peux pas faire grand-chose pour toi, mais bonne chance là-bas. Je ne voudrais pas te voir perdre une de tes neuf vies.${prompt}
But as long as you are okay...;Bon retour. À en juger par ton apparence, tu as eu des moments difficiles là-bas... Mais c'est à peu près tout ce que je sais. Le patron ne nous dit jamais rien de ce qui se passe...${prompt}
Ahem! Don't be a stranger, ${name-player}!${prompt};Mais tant que tu vas bien...
If only Lion were okay, as well...${prompt};Hum ! Ne sois pas un étranger, ${name-player}!${prompt}
Welcome to the Tenshodo. You want something, we got it. We got all kinds of special merchandise you won't find anywhere else!${prompt};Si seulement Lion allait bien aussi...${prompt}
We ain't cheap, but you get what you pay for! Take your time, have a look around, see if there's somethin' you like.${prompt};Bienvenue au Tenshodo. Vous cherchez quelque chose, nous l'avons. Nous avons toutes sortes de marchandises spéciales que vous ne trouverez nulle part ailleurs !${prompt}
Our boss looks all hairy-scary, but he caves in to his sister Verena all the time.${prompt};Nous ne sommes pas bon marché, mais vous en avez pour votre argent ! Prenez votre temps, jetez un coup d'œil, voyez s'il y a quelque chose qui vous plaît.${prompt}
Verena's a really nice girl. We all think she's super-duper swell.${prompt};Notre patron a l'air effrayant, mais il cède toujours à sa sœur Verena.${prompt}
But don't you lay a single-wingle finger on her. People who do... Well, they have a tendency to be found dead, floating off the pier. So please, keep that in mind.${prompt};Verena est une fille vraiment gentille. Nous pensons tous qu'elle est super chouette.${prompt}
Wait, so all you got from Aldo was ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}? Kinda stingy-winjy of him, don't you think?${prompt};Mais ne posez pas un seul doigt sur elle. Les gens qui le font... Eh bien, ils ont tendance à être retrouvés morts, flottant au large de la jetée. Alors, gardez cela à l'esprit.${prompt}
There's a place in Beadeaux where you need ${keyitem-article: 4[2]} and ${keyitem-article: 6[2]} just to get in. If you want, we can try to hook you up.${prompt};Attends, tout ce que tu as eu d’Aldo, c’est ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} ? Un peu radin de sa part, tu ne trouves pas ?${prompt}
Tell you what. I'll trade you ${keyitem-article: 4[2]} for ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, and I'll let you have ${keyitem-article: 6[2]} if you find me ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt};Il y a un endroit à Beadeaux où vous avez besoin de ${keyitem-article: 4[2]} et de ${keyitem-article: 6[2]} juste pour entrer. Si vous voulez, on peut essayer de vous arranger ça.${prompt}
Okey-dokey, here you go.${prompt};Je te propose un marché. Je te donne ${keyitem-article: 4[2]} en échange de ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}, et je te laisserai avoir ${keyitem-article: 6[2]} si tu me trouves ${article} ${item-article: 7[2]}.${prompt}
Hey, how'd you know we were lookin' for this? Well, anyway... Here you go!${prompt};Okidoki, voilà.${prompt}
Okey-dokey, here you go.${prompt};Hé, comment as-tu su que nous cherchions ça ? Bon, de toute façon... Voilà !${prompt}
Hey, how'd you know we were lookin' for this? Well, anyway... Here you go!${prompt};Okidoki, voilà.${prompt}
I'm shocked... I'm stunned... I can't believe that Lady-wady Verena is missing. If I had the time, I'd be out there searching...${prompt};Hé, comment as-tu su que nous cherchions ça ? Bon, de toute façon... Voilà !${prompt}
If anything happened to her, what would I do!?${prompt};Je suis choqué... Je suis abasourdi... Je ne peux pas croire que Lady Verena soit disparue. Si j'avais le temps, je serais dehors à chercher...${prompt}
That cutie-wootie Lion was here the other day talking to the boss. A lucky man, he is...${prompt};Si quelque chose lui arrivait, que ferais-je ?${prompt}
Lady-wady Verena is back, but she's not doing that good... What did she do to deserve this!?${prompt};Cette adorable Lion était ici l'autre jour, parlant avec le patron. Un homme chanceux, il est...${prompt}
What happened in Delkfutt's Tower!? You can tell me, we're buddy-wuddies!${prompt};Lady Verena est de retour, mais elle ne va pas très bien... Qu'a-t-elle fait pour mériter ça ?${prompt}
Tell him about what happened?;Que s'est-il passé dans la tour de Delkfutt ? Tu peux me le dire, nous sommes amis !${prompt}
${selection-lines};Lui parler de ce qui s'est passé ?
Yes.;${selection-lines}
No.${prompt};Oui.
No, wait...;Non.${prompt}
Maybe it's better that I don't know.  I'll just pray for Lady-wady Verena's recovery, and ask her myself.${prompt};Non, attends...
You mean, it was that bad...?;Peut-être vaut-il mieux que je ne sache pas. Je vais juste prier pour le rétablissement de Dame Verena et lui demander moi-même.${prompt}
Okay, just forget that I asked.${prompt};Tu veux dire que c'était si grave... ?
Lady-wady Verena's bak in tip-top shape? That's great! Maybe I should go in and see how she's doing... But what if she's forgotten who I was!?${prompt};D'accord, oublie que j'ai posé la question.${prompt}
The boss told me to get his equipment ready-steady. But, when I asked him where he was going, he told me to mind my own busy-business!${prompt};Dame Verena est de retour en pleine forme ? C'est génial ! Peut-être que je devrais aller la voir... Mais et si elle avait oublié qui j'étais ?${prompt}
This is great! This is stupendous! I have a feeling that everything will finally-winally go back to being the way it was!${prompt};Le patron m'a dit de préparer son équipement. Mais quand je lui ai demandé où il allait, il m'a dit de m'occuper de mes affaires !${prompt}
But I'm still kinda worried about Verena... She's growing up so fast!${prompt};C'est génial ! C'est stupéfiant ! J'ai le sentiment que tout va enfin redevenir comme avant !${prompt}
Welcome to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. We assist the community with job placement and labor arbitration.${prompt};Mais je suis quand même un peu inquiet pour Verena... Elle grandit tellement vite !${prompt}
What can I help you with?;Bienvenue à la Chambre de commerce et d'industrie. Nous aidons la communauté avec le placement professionnel et l'arbitrage du travail.${prompt}
${selection-lines};En quoi puis-je vous aider ?
Oh, nothing.;${selection-lines}
I'd like ${keyitem-article: 6[2]}.;Oh, rien.
I'd like to start a petition.;Je voudrais ${keyitem-article: 6[2]}.
I want to learn about petitions.${prompt};Je voudrais commencer une pétition.
Have a nice day. Next!${prompt};Je veux en savoir plus sur les pétitions.${prompt}
The ${keyitem-singular: 6[2]} costs ${number: 7} gil. Convenient routes connect Jeuno with the three allied nations. Passes are non-transferable, but never expire.${prompt};Passez une bonne journée. Suivant !${prompt}
The archduke occasionally issues them, but His Grace is not an easy man to meet.${prompt};Le ${keyitem-singular: 6[2]} coûte ${number: 7} gil. Des itinéraires pratiques relient Jeuno aux trois nations alliées. Les laissez-passer sont incessibles mais n’expirent jamais.${prompt}
Purchase ${keyitem-article: 6[2]}?;L'archiduc les délivre occasionnellement, mais Son Altesse n'est pas facile à rencontrer.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Acheter ${keyitem-article: 6[2]} ?
Yes, please.;${selection-lines}
No, not right now.${prompt};Oui, s'il vous plaît.
Thank you very much. Safe and pleasant journeys to you!${prompt};Non, pas maintenant.${prompt}
Um, you don't have enough money.${prompt};Merci beaucoup. Je vous souhaite un bon voyage!${prompt}
Oh, that clock tower? Yes, it's quite run down, so it's scheduled for demolition. The city needs a crane there, as ships anchor right beneath it.${prompt};Vous n'avez pas assez d'argent.${prompt}
Of course, if enough people oppose the plan, the authorities might reconsider. You'll need at least ${number: 1} signatories for the petition to be accepted.${prompt};Oh, cette tour de l'horloge ? Oui, elle est assez délabrée et sa démolition est prévue. La ville a besoin d'une grue à cet endroit, car les navires jettent l'ancre juste en dessous.${prompt}
Would you like a petition ledger?;Bien entendu, si un nombre suffisant de personnes s’opposent au projet, les autorités pourraient reconsidérer leur position. Il vous faudra au moins ${number : 1} signataires pour que la pétition soit acceptée.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Souhaitez-vous un registre des pétitions ?
Yes.;${selection-lines}
No, thanks.${prompt};Oui.
Okay. Come back and submit the ledger once you have ${number: 1} signatures.${prompt};Non, merci.${prompt}
Find people who are interested in your cause. Of course, please try to respect people who don't share your views.${prompt};D'accord. Revenez et soumettez le registre une fois que vous avez ${number: 1} signatures.${prompt}
Um, I don't think you can carry any more.${prompt};Trouvez des personnes intéressées par votre cause. Bien sûr, veuillez respecter ceux qui ne partagent pas vos opinions.${prompt}
Gather ${number: 1} signatures for the petition. People who are interested in your cause should sign. And please respect those of differing views.${prompt};Eh bien, je ne pense pas que vous puissiez en porter plus.${prompt}
We can issue you a new ${item-singular: 7[2]} if you like. Of course, you'll have to start over with any signatures you've collected.${prompt};Rassemblez ${number: 1} signatures pour la pétition. Les personnes intéressées par votre cause devraient signer. Et veuillez respecter ceux qui ont des opinions différentes.${prompt}
Would you like another petition ledger?;Nous pouvons vous fournir un nouveau ${item-singular: 7[2]} si vous le souhaitez. Bien sûr, vous devrez recommencer avec toutes les signatures que vous avez collectées.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Souhaitez-vous un autre registre de pétition ?
Yeah.;${selection-lines}
No, I'm all right.${prompt};Oui.
Very well. I'll prepare the necessary paperwork.${prompt};Non, ça va.${prompt}
You still need ${number: 0} more ${choice-plurality: 0}[signature/signatures].${prompt};Très bien. Je vais préparer les documents nécessaires.${prompt}
How's the petition going? Wow, you have quite a lot of signatures here. I'll submit this to the chamber board. I doubt they'll demolish the clock tower now.${prompt};Il vous manque encore ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[signature/signatures].${prompt}
You know, I came to Jeuno to shop at a splendid store called the “Tenshodo,” but I can't find it anywhere! Where could it be?${prompt};Comment se passe la pétition ? Wow, vous avez pas mal de signatures ici. Je vais soumettre cela au conseil municipal. Je doute qu'ils démolissent maintenant la tour de l'horloge.${prompt}
I can't wait to see their selection of fine jewelry and accessories. I'm not going home till I find it!${prompt};"Vous savez, je suis venu à Jeuno pour faire des achats dans un magasin splendide appelé le ""Tenshodo"", mais je ne le trouve nulle part ! Où pourrait-il être ?${prompt}"
They say it can be found “right under your nose.” But what could they mean?${prompt};Je suis impatient de voir leur sélection de bijoux et accessoires de luxe. Je ne rentrerai pas chez moi tant que je ne l'aurai pas trouvé !${prompt}
Oh, yes... I've seen people pass ${item-plural: 0[2]} to the front desk here, but they won't tell me where they got them. Where can I get one?${prompt};"On dit qu'il peut être trouvé ""juste sous votre nez"". Mais que peuvent-ils vouloir dire ?${prompt}"
What? You're a Tenshodo member now, too? And you're not going to give me an invite? How dare you!${prompt};Oh, oui... J’ai vu des gens passer ${item-plural: 0[2]} au bureau d’accueil ici, mais ils ne veulent pas me dire où ils les ont obtenus. Où puis-je en obtenir un ?${prompt}
I don't believe this! Well, fine! I'll find one myself!${prompt};Quoi ? Vous êtes aussi membre du Tenshodo maintenant ? Et vous ne allez pas me donner une invitation ? Comment osez-vous !${prompt}
Great bridges from the days of old span the straits below. Jeuno merely sprang up atop their ruins.${prompt};Je n'en crois pas mes yeux ! Eh bien, très bien ! Je vais en trouver un moi-même !${prompt}
No one knows how--or even why--our ancestors built the bridges. Of course, that doesn't stop us from living our lives atop them.${prompt};De grands ponts des temps anciens enjambent les détroits en dessous. Jeuno a simplement surgi au sommet de leurs ruines.${prompt}
And they're a great way to break the ice with strangers, don't you think?${prompt};Personne ne sait comment--ou même pourquoi--nos ancêtres ont construit les ponts. Bien sûr, cela ne nous empêche pas de vivre nos vies au-dessus.${prompt}
I heard Jeuno began about eighty years ago when fishermen settled here. It was just a tiny fishing village back then.${prompt};Et ils sont un excellent moyen de briser la glace avec des étrangers, vous ne trouvez pas ?${prompt}
As you can see from any map, Jeuno lies on a crossroads binding the three nations together. A hub of commerce, Jeuno grew wealthy.${prompt};J'ai entendu dire que Jeuno a commencé il y a environ quatre-vingts ans lorsque des pêcheurs se sont installés ici. C'était juste un petit village de pêcheurs à l'époque.${prompt}
Soon it was filled with the bustle of buyer and seller. Our humble district captures that particular energy better than any other.${prompt};Comme vous pouvez le voir sur n'importe quelle carte, Jeuno se trouve à un carrefour reliant les trois nations. Un centre commercial, Jeuno est devenu riche.${prompt}
Huh? What am I doing here? I'm looking for work! I got fired from my last place. Something about talking too much...${prompt};Bientôt, il était rempli de l'agitation de l'acheteur et du vendeur. Notre humble quartier capture cette énergie particulière mieux que tout autre.${prompt}
“Do Not Disturb”${prompt};Hein ? Qu'est-ce que je fais ici ? Je cherche du travail ! J'ai été viré de mon dernier emploi. Quelque chose à propos de parler trop...${prompt}
We just got our compatibility read by that fortune-teller over there...${prompt};“Ne pas déranger”${prompt}
You won't believe it. Zero compatibility! I thought we were a perfect match for each other!${prompt};Nous venons de faire lire notre compatibilité par cette diseuse de bonne aventure là-bas...${prompt}
Come on, honey... It's just a fortune! Cheer up, okay?${prompt};Vous n'allez pas le croire. Zéro compatibilité ! Je pensais que nous étions parfaitement faits l'un pour l'autre !${prompt}
She won't listen to me. I'd be careful with fortunes if I were you.${prompt};Allez, chérie... Ce n'est qu'une prédiction ! Remonte-toi le moral, d'accord ?${prompt}
Hey! I'm changing!${prompt};Elle ne m'écoute pas. Je serais prudent avec les prédictions si j'étais toi.${prompt}
Oh, dear... There are so many to choose from! I don't know what to pick. By the way, do you think this looks good on me?${prompt};Hé ! Je me change !${prompt}
I don't think it does. I need something that jumps out and screams “me.” Hmm... What to choose...${prompt};Oh, mon Dieu... Il y en a tellement à choisir ! Je ne sais pas quoi choisir. Au fait, est-ce que ça me va bien ?${prompt}
Oh, I love jewelry. I could stay and look at diamonds all day long. Why don't men understand?${prompt};"Je ne pense pas. J'ai besoin de quelque chose qui ressorte et crie ""moi"". Hmm... Que choisir...${prompt}"
Why do women always go gaga over diamonds? I don't get it at all.${prompt};Oh, j'adore les bijoux. Je pourrais rester là et regarder des diamants toute la journée. Pourquoi les hommes ne comprennent-ils pas ?${prompt}
She's having fun, so that's fine. I just wish she'd hurry up and pick something out already!${prompt};Pourquoi les femmes s'extasient-elles toujours sur les diamants ? Je ne comprends pas du tout.${prompt}
Goblins run this shop, but don't worry. They're not hostile. I guess they're not all the same...${prompt};Elle s'amuse, alors c'est bien. J'aimerais juste qu'elle se dépêche de choisir quelque chose !${prompt}
I like diversity, but I get chills just stepping in there. Still, they carry things you can't find anywhere else.${prompt};Des gobelins tiennent cette boutique, mais ne vous inquiétez pas. Ils ne sont pas hostiles. Je suppose qu'ils ne sont pas tous pareils...${prompt}
This shop's famous among locals for the three beautiful women behind the counter. Which one's my favorite? Well, that's a secret.${prompt};J'aime la diversité, mais j'ai des frissons juste en y entrant. Pourtant, ils ont des choses que vous ne pouvez trouver nulle part ailleurs.${prompt}
I wonder which one is the prettiest from a woman's standpoint...${prompt};Ce magasin est célèbre parmi les habitants pour les trois belles femmes derrière le comptoir. Laquelle est ma préférée ? Eh bien, c'est un secret.${prompt}
Hmm... So you prefer classical beauty. Don't tell anyone, but I like her the best, too.${prompt};Je me demande laquelle est la plus jolie du point de vue d'une femme...${prompt}
Whoa, so you go for older women, huh? You like a lady who takes charge... Well, she is stunning.${prompt};Hmm... Donc, vous préférez la beauté classique. Ne le dites à personne, mais je l'aime aussi le mieux.${prompt}
Wow, so you're into the pure and innocent type, huh? Yeah, she sure is cute.${prompt};Whoa, donc vous aimez les femmes plus âgées, hein ? Vous aimez une dame qui prend les choses en main... Eh bien, elle est superbe.${prompt}
I must never-ever tell a soul. No one can know how fat I looked when I bought a size too small...${prompt};Wow, donc vous êtes attiré par le type pur et innocent, hein ? Ouais, elle est vraiment mignonne.${prompt}
Huh? No! I didn't mean that! See, I bought something I couldn't wear for my current job! You always have to watch out for that, you know. Ahahaha!${prompt};Je ne dois jamais, jamais révéler cela à qui que ce soit. Personne ne peut savoir à quel point j'avais l'air gros quand j'ai acheté une taille trop petite...${prompt}
Collet hasn't been to school in ages! I hope she's doing okay.${prompt};Hein ? Non ! Je ne voulais pas dire ça ! Voyez-vous, j'ai acheté quelque chose que je ne pouvais pas porter pour mon travail actuel ! Vous devez toujours faire attention à ça, vous savez. Ahahaha !${prompt}
Galmut always tells herrr, “Leave it to me.” But what could it be? I do hope she comes back soon.${prompt};Collet n'est pas allée à l'école depuis des lustres ! J'espère qu'elle va bien.${prompt}
Would you like to see a map of Jeuno?${prompt};Galmut lui dit toujours, “Laisse-moi faire.” Mais que pourrait-ce être ? J'espère qu'elle revient bientôt.${prompt}
See a map of Jeuno?;Voulez-vous voir une carte de Jeuno ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Voulez-vous voir une carte de Jeuno ?
Show me.;${selection-lines}
I'm fine.${prompt};Montrez-moi.
We're currently standing in Lower Jeuno, the third level from the top.${prompt};Ça va.${prompt}
I used to watch the harbor filled with ships. But ever since the airships came, those days are gone.${prompt};Nous nous trouvons actuellement dans Lower Jeuno, le troisième niveau depuis le sommet.${prompt}
Progress is a good thing, but it's still sad.${prompt};Autrefois, je regardais le port rempli de bateaux. Mais depuis l'arrivée des aéronefs, ces jours sont révolus.${prompt}
I'm searching for the perfect fishing spot. Thing is, I've been looking so long, I don't have time to fish!${prompt};Le progrès est une bonne chose, mais c'est quand même triste.${prompt}
I bought a home here in Jeuno, but I wish I'd known about that awful bar downstairs. Every night those bards carouse till dawn. What am I to do?${prompt};Je suis à la recherche de l'endroit de pêche parfait. Le problème, c'est que je cherche depuis si longtemps que je n'ai pas le temps de pêcher !${prompt}
Jeuno's a special city. We're a melting pot of all different kinds of people. I love this town.${prompt};J'ai acheté une maison ici à Jeuno, mais j'aurais aimé savoir pour ce terrible bar en bas. Chaque nuit, ces bardes font la fête jusqu'à l'aube. Que puis-je faire ?${prompt}
Of course, sometimes we fail to understand how different we all are. That's just the kind of thing we need to avoid.${prompt};Jeuno est une ville spéciale. Nous sommes un melting-pot de toutes sortes de gens différents. J'adore cette ville.${prompt}
I like to stand here and watch you people rrrun back and forth all day. I wonder what the hurry is...${prompt};Bien sûr, parfois, nous échouons à comprendre à quel point nous sommes tous différents. C'est juste le genre de chose que nous devons éviter.${prompt}
Sometimes you should slow down and walk for a change. You know, stop and smell the rrroses!${prompt};J'aime me tenir ici et regarder les gens courir de long en large toute la journée. Je me demande quelle est la précipitation...${prompt}
Good day, and welcome to Lower Jeuno. Our neighborhood is the city's premier retail destination, handling a broad range of merchandise.${prompt};Parfois, vous devriez ralentir et marcher pour changer. Vous savez, vous arrêter et sentir les roses !${prompt}
We hope you enjoy the unique shopping experience of Lower Jeuno. What, you were expecting someone younger? Away with you!${prompt};Bonjour et bienvenue à Lower Jeuno. Notre quartier est la destination commerciale de premier choix de la ville, offrant une large gamme de marchandises.${prompt}
To me, the auction's like a game of wits between me and the other bidders.${prompt};Nous espérons que vous apprécierez l'expérience de shopping unique de Lower Jeuno. Quoi, vous vous attendiez à quelqu'un de plus jeune ? Allez-vous-en !${prompt}
You always have to keep tabs on what you really want, and how much you want to pay for it. It's so easy to get carried away!${prompt};Pour moi, la vente aux enchères est comme un jeu d'intelligence entre moi et les autres enchérisseurs.${prompt}
When I was but a lass, I oft would follow my lover to this fountain. He would speak barely a word, so shy was he!${prompt};Vous devez toujours surveiller ce que vous voulez vraiment et combien vous êtes prêt à payer pour cela. Il est si facile de se laisser emporter !${prompt}
To love someone is a wonderful thing. Only now, at my age, does that seem so clear.${prompt};Quand j'étais jeune fille, je suivais souvent mon amoureux jusqu'à cette fontaine. Il ne disait presque rien, tellement il était timide !${prompt}
Oh, my husband? Yes, he's quite well. He's so full of life, I know not what to do!${prompt};Aimer quelqu'un est une chose merveilleuse. Ce n'est que maintenant, à mon âge, que cela semble si clair.${prompt}
You must examine all the advertisements to find the very best deals!${prompt};Oh, mon mari ? Oui, il va très bien. Il est tellement plein de vie, je ne sais pas quoi faire !${prompt}
Little may be the difference between these shops, but ever am I thrilled to save some gil. Oh, such a miser am I!${prompt};Vous devez examiner toutes les annonces pour trouver les meilleures offres !${prompt}
Your inventory capacity has increased.${prompt};Il peut y avoir peu de différence entre ces magasins, mais je suis toujours ravi d'économiser quelques gils. Oh, je suis si avare !${prompt}
Now offering quick and easy delivery of packages to residences everywhere!${prompt};Votre capacité d'inventaire a augmenté.${prompt}
You don't deserve no bigger bag...yet.${prompt};Offre maintenant une livraison rapide et facile de colis à toutes les résidences !${prompt}
I instruct Tenshodo members in the way of the fist and foot. In their line of work, there are times they must defend themselves, you see.${prompt};Vous ne méritez pas un sac plus grand... pour l'instant.${prompt}
I'd watch out if I were you. Stick your nose into places you don't belong, and you could find yourself in trouble.${prompt};J'enseigne aux membres de Tenshodo la voie du poing et du pied. Dans leur domaine, il arrive parfois qu'ils doivent se défendre, vous comprenez.${prompt}
Well, well... I see you have attained your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. But you still need more training, child. You must seek the rank of ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};Je ferais attention si j'étais vous. Mettez votre nez là où vous ne devriez pas, et vous pourriez vous retrouver dans des ennuis.${prompt}
When you are ready, I will test you. If you prove yourself worthy of promotion, the ${item-singular: 1[2]} will be yours.${prompt};Eh bien, eh bien... Je vois que vous avez obtenu votre ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Mais vous avez encore besoin de plus d’entraînement, jeune enfant. Vous devez atteindre le grade de ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Are you ready for the test?;Quand vous serez prêt, je vous testerai. Si vous vous révélez digne de la promotion, le ${item-singular: 1[2]} sera à vous.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Êtes-vous prêt pour le test ?
Bring it on.;${selection-lines}
No, not yet.${prompt};Que ça commence.
Very good, child. A true martial artist always conquers fear. Defeat the following opponents in mortal combat, and bring me proof of their demise.${prompt};Non, pas encore.${prompt}
Slay a nue for its ${item-singular: 2[2]}, a morbolger for its ${item-singular: 3[2]}, and a deadly dodo for its ${item-singular: 4[2]}. Gather these and bring them to me.${prompt};Très bien, mon enfant. Un véritable artiste martial surmonte toujours la peur. Terrassez les adversaires suivants dans un combat mortel et apportez-moi la preuve de leur disparition.${prompt}
Only then will you be worthy of promotion. Now, go!${prompt};Tuez un nue pour son ${item-singular: 2[2]}, un morbolger pour son ${item-singular: 3[2]}, et un dodo mortel pour son ${item-singular: 4[2]}. Rassemblez-les et apportez-les-moi.${prompt}
What are you afraid of? The true martial artist does not fear.${prompt};Seulement alors serez-vous digne de promotion. Allez maintenant !${prompt}
Oh... The circle is now complete. Wear this ${item-singular: 1[2]} with pride and honor. Always remember the trials you faced to claim it.${prompt};De quoi avez-vous peur ? Le véritable artiste martial ne craint pas.${prompt}
Perhaps one day we can face each other in open-hand combat. A glorious fight that would be, don't you think?${prompt};Oh... Le cercle est maintenant complet. Portez ce ${item-singular: 1[2]} avec fierté et honneur. N’oubliez jamais les épreuves que vous avez affrontées pour le récupérer.${prompt}
You call yourself ${name-player}? Well, I've never heard of you. You may be somebody in your little hometown, but things are different here.${prompt};Peut-être qu'un jour nous pourrons nous affronter en combat à mains nues. Un combat glorieux, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
All roads lead to Jeuno. It's not easy to make a name for yourself with all these people here.${prompt};Vous vous appelez ${name-player} ? Eh bien, je n'ai jamais entendu parler de vous. Vous êtes peut-être quelqu'un dans votre petite ville, mais les choses sont différentes ici.${prompt}
If you're really so famous back home, then word should reach here eventually. For now, just finish what you've started. Fame and fortune should follow.${prompt};Tous les chemins mènent à Jeuno. Ce n'est pas facile de se faire un nom avec tous ces gens ici.${prompt}
${name-player}, eh? Hmm... That name is vaguely familiar...${prompt};Si vous êtes vraiment si célèbre chez vous, alors tôt ou tard, le mot devrait parvenir ici. Pour l'instant, terminez simplement ce que vous avez commencé. La gloire et la fortune suivront.${prompt}
But I'm afraid few in this town have heard of you. Just keep working at it. You'll make a name for yourself eventually.${prompt};${name-player}, hein ? Hmm... Ce nom me dit vaguement quelque chose...${prompt}
Oh, so you're ${name-player}... Yes, I heard some travelers in a tavern talk about you. It seems you've a fair reputation.${prompt};Mais j'ai bien peur que peu de gens dans cette ville n'aient entendu parler de vous. Continuez simplement. Vous vous ferez un nom tôt ou tard.${prompt}
If you keep doing whatever you're doing, I'm sure more Jeunoans will come seeking your help. Good luck.${prompt};Oh, donc vous êtes ${name-player}... Oui, j'ai entendu quelques voyageurs dans une taverne parler de vous. Il semble que vous ayez une bonne réputation.${prompt}
Hello, ${name-player}! I hear your name mentioned quite often these days. You've done well, my friend. Keep at it.${prompt};Si vous continuez à faire ce que vous faites, je suis sûr que davantage de Jeunoans viendront chercher votre aide. Bonne chance.${prompt}

Why, hello, ${name-player}. I say, literally everyone in Jeuno knows your name.${prompt};Nous espérons que vos contributions déjà substantielles à notre modeste ville continueront de croître avec le temps.${prompt}
It is my pleasure to inform you how impressed we are with your service to Jeuno. We hope to see more of your commendable generosity in the future!${prompt};Tiens, bonjour, ${name-player}. Je vous assure, littéralement tout le monde à Jeuno connaît votre nom.${prompt}

Pour tous les citoyens d'ici, votre nom est synonyme de courage et de sacrifice. Pas un jour ne se passe sans entendre parler de votre service quasi-saint à Jeuno.${prompt}
Welcome to the auction house.;Je parle au nom de tout Jeuno lorsque j'exprime ma sincère appréciation pour votre générosité. En effet, les bardes chanteront vos vertus pour les siècles à venir !${prompt}
Do you have any questions about our establishment?${prompt};Bienvenue à la maison des enchères.
What do you want to know?;Avez-vous des questions sur notre établissement ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Que voulez-vous savoir ?
What is the auction house?;${selection-lines}
How are auctions run?;Qu'est-ce que la maison des enchères ?
Are there any fees?;Comment se déroulent les enchères ?
Are there any limits?;Y a-t-il des frais ?
How do you check up on merchandise?;Y a-t-il des limites ?
How do you remove an item?;Comment vérifiez-vous les marchandises ?
My “Sales Status” list is full!;Comment supprimez-vous un article ?
Nothing right now.${prompt};"Ma liste de ""Statut des ventes"" est pleine !"
Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.${prompt};Rien pour le moment.${prompt}
Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.${prompt};Les maisons de vente aux enchères se trouvent dans toutes les principales villes de Vana'diel. C'est là que les aventuriers se rassemblent pour enchérir sur les butins de bataille, les objets indésirables, les vieilles armures... presque tout.${prompt}
Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.${prompt};Actuellement, les maisons de vente aux enchères à Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst et Jeuno fonctionnent toutes de manière indépendante. Par conséquent, les prix diffèrent d'une ville à l'autre.${prompt}
The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.${prompt};Les aventuriers peuvent utiliser n'importe quelle maison de vente aux enchères, quelle que soit leur nationalité.${prompt}
Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).${prompt};Le premier aventurier à enchérir au prix demandé ou plus achètera automatiquement le produit.${prompt}
If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.${prompt};Une fois mis en vente aux enchères, un article restera là pendant un maximum de trente semaines, temps Vana'diel (neuf jours et demi, temps terrestre).${prompt}
Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.${prompt};Si un article ne se vend pas dans ce délai, il sera renvoyé à la résidence actuelle du vendeur.${prompt}
A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.${prompt};Les frais de transaction sont proportionnels au montant pour lequel un article est mis en vente aux enchères. La méthode de calcul de ces frais est différente pour les articles simples et les articles empilables.${prompt}
The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.${prompt};Des frais de transaction sont prélevés lorsque n'importe quelle marchandise est mise en vente aux enchères. Ces frais ne sont pas remboursables.${prompt}
However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.${prompt};Le Comité international des maisons de vente aux enchères, ou CIHVE, a déclaré qu'un maximum de sept articles pouvaient être mis aux enchères en même temps.${prompt}
A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.${prompt};Cependant, le CIHVE a récemment supprimé la limite du nombre d'articles qu'une personne peut acheter.${prompt}
Once an item appears on your “Sales Status” list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.${prompt};Un petit laps de temps est nécessaire avant que de nouveaux articles n'apparaissent sur notre liste d'enchères.${prompt}
If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select “Stop Sale” from the “Sales Status” menu.${prompt};"Une fois qu'un article apparaît sur votre liste ""Statut des ventes"", il peut ne pas apparaître immédiatement sur la liste des enchères. Si vous ne voyez pas votre article sur la liste des enchères, essayez de regarder à nouveau plus tard.${prompt}"
To remove an item from your “Sales Status” list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.${prompt};"Si vous souhaitez retirer un article d'une vente aux enchères, vous devez vous rendre à la maison de vente aux enchères et sélectionner ""Arrêter la vente"" dans le menu ""Statut des ventes"".${prompt}"
Otherwise, previously sold or returned items will fill up your list and prevent you from selling any more merchandise.${prompt};"Pour supprimer un article de votre liste ""Statut des ventes"", vous devez visiter un comptoir de vente aux enchères pour confirmer la vente ou le retour de votre marchandise.${prompt}"
At any auction counter, open the “Sales Status” menu and acknowledge the transaction to clear it from the list.${prompt};Sinon, les articles précédemment vendus ou retournés rempliront votre liste et vous empêcheront de vendre d'autres marchandises.${prompt}
Press the confirm button to remove any transaction colored yellow (sold) or red (returned).${prompt};"À n'importe quel comptoir de vente aux enchères, ouvrez le menu ""Statut des ventes"" et confirmez la transaction pour la supprimer de la liste.${prompt}"
Is there anything else you would like to know?${prompt};Appuyez sur le bouton de confirmation pour supprimer toute transaction colorée en jaune (vendue) ou en rouge (retournée).${prompt}
In the past, many have amassed great wealth through the auction house. I hope you find fortune, too!${prompt};Y a-t-il autre chose que vous aimeriez savoir ?${prompt}

The boss is walking around like he's seen the Gates of Paradise, or something.${prompt};What's going on?
He always gets like that when you're around.;The boss is walking around like he's seen the Gates of Paradise, or something.${prompt}
I don't get it, you don't look that special to me.;Il est toujours comme ça quand tu es là.
It's starting to give me the heebie-jeebies...${prompt};Je ne comprends pas, tu n'as pas l'air si spécial pour moi.
Being part of the Tenshodo means you'll sell your soul for the right amount of gil.${prompt};Ça commence à me donner la chair de poule...${prompt}
Besides, taking risks is good for business, I always say.${prompt};Faire partie des Tenshodo signifie que tu vendrais ton âme pour la bonne somme de gil.${prompt}
This time, we 'ave got quite a special customer, so we can't go prattling off about the details of their request to just anyone.${prompt};De plus, prendre des risques est bon pour les affaires, je dis toujours.${prompt}
Getting wind of such a thing could make our client a mite angry, and we certainly wouldn't want that.${prompt};Cette fois, nous avons un client très spécial, alors nous ne pouvons pas révéler les détails de sa demande à n'importe qui.${prompt}
That's why I 'ave been mixing up the orders with random bits o' information and givin' out mere snippets at a time. Those o' you with sense should be able to put it all together, is what I think.${prompt};Si cela venait à se savoir, notre client pourrait se mettre en colère, et nous ne voudrions certainement pas cela.${prompt}
I dare say I think you may fit into tha' category, as well.${prompt};C'est pourquoi j'ai mélangé les commandes avec des informations aléatoires et donné de simples bribes à la fois. Ceux qui ont du sens devraient pouvoir tout assembler, à mon avis.${prompt}
Anyway, that's how things are standing at the moment.;Je dirais que tu pourrais aussi appartenir à cette catégorie.${prompt}
Well, what need you? Speak up now.${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit, c'est ainsi que les choses se présentent pour le moment.
Ask about what?;Eh bien, que veux-tu ? Parle maintenant.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Demander à propos de quoi ?
Goods for sale.;${selection-lines}
Nothing.;Marchandises à vendre.
${prompt};Rien.
Looks like I was wrong about you.;${prompt}
Anyway, if you want to buy goods, hop on over to Ghebi Damomohe at the entrance or jus' talk to the two at the counter.${prompt};On dirait que je me suis trompé à ton sujet.
That's all I have t' say to you. Now get out o' here and let me do my business in peace.${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit, si tu veux acheter des marchandises, va voir Ghebi Damomohe à l'entrée ou parle juste aux deux au comptoir.${prompt}
If you do not need anything, wha' in blazes are you doing hangin' about here in the first place?${prompt};C'est tout ce que j'ai à te dire. Maintenant, sors d'ici et laisse-moi faire mes affaires en paix.${prompt}
Why, I must say you're even brighter than you look.;Si tu n'as besoin de rien, que fais-tu donc ici à traîner dans les parages ?${prompt}
You got 'ere the same way, didn't you?${prompt};Eh bien, je dois dire que tu es encore plus intelligent que tu n'en as l'air.
Lately, people 'ave been strewing about ${item-plural: 0[2]} like there's no tomorrow, so a lot o' Tenshodo members don't know that trick.${prompt};Tu es arrivé ici de la même manière, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
O' course, me and the boss are on a whole different plane o' thinking.${prompt};Dernièrement, les gens ont éparpillé des ${item-plural: 0[2]} comme s’il n’y avait pas de lendemain, donc beaucoup de membres du Tenshodo ne connaissent pas ce tour.${prompt}
Still, the notion of “seeing the unseen” was one o' the main draws of the Tenshodo for me in the beginning. I've got high hopes for you...${prompt};Bien sûr, moi et le patron sommes sur un tout autre plan de réflexion.${prompt}
Eh?${prompt};Pourtant, la notion de « voir l'invisible » était l'une des principales attractions du Tenshodo pour moi au début. J'ai de grands espoirs pour toi...${prompt}
Ah, sorry. I left out the most important part, didn't I? Sorry t' leave you hanging there.${prompt};Hein ?${prompt}
Um... What was I saying, again?;Ah, désolé. J'ai laissé de côté la partie la plus importante, n’est-ce pas ? Désolé de te laisser en suspens.${prompt}
Oh, yeah...the Empire of Aht Urhgan. You want t' see the Near East, don't you? I can see it in your eyes.${prompt};Euh... Qu'est-ce que je disais, déjà ?
How does Aht Urhgan sound to you?;Oh, oui... l'Empire d'Aht Urhgan. Tu veux voir le Proche-Orient, n'est-ce pas ? Je le vois dans tes yeux.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Que penses-tu d'Aht Urhgan ?
I want to go!;${selection-lines}
Psh, not interested.;Je veux y aller !
${prompt};Bof, pas intéressé.
Heheh, I appreciate your honesty.${prompt};${prompt}
Is 'at so? That's all I 'ave to say to you then, so get out o' here.${prompt};Heheh, j'apprécie ton honnêteté.${prompt}
Well, aren't you clever? But once is enough. Seriously.${prompt};Est-ce que c'est ça ? C'est tout ce que j'ai à te dire alors, sors d'ici.${prompt}
Anyway, that's enough batting aroun' the bush for now. Let's dig straight in t' the juicy details, shall we?${prompt};Eh bien, n'es-tu pas intelligent ? Mais une fois, c'est suffisant. Sérieusement.${prompt}
You know the ships at Mhaura used t' transport prospective mercenaries to the Near East? If you want t' climb aboard one o' those vessels, you 'ave got to go through none other than the Tenshodo here.${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit, assez tourné autour du pot pour l'instant. Passons directement aux détails croustillants, d'accord ?${prompt}
We received a request from the Empire 'erself. Getting those ships t' port was a royal pain. We finally managed t' bargain a cheap price on some rickety old vessels, and...${prompt};Tu sais que les navires à Mhaura transportaient autrefois des mercenaires potentiels vers le Proche-Orient ? Si tu veux monter à bord de l'un de ces navires, tu dois passer par le Tenshodo ici.${prompt}
And you don't care. Sorry abou' that. A man's got to vent sometimes.${prompt};Nous avons reçu une demande de l'Empire elle-même. Faire accoster ces navires était un véritable casse-tête. Nous avons finalement réussi à négocier un prix avantageux sur quelques vieux navires délabrés, et...${prompt}
Anyway, you should know by now how things work around 'ere. If you want something, you 'ave to bring me something I want, first.${prompt};Et tu t'en fiches. Désolé pour ça. Un homme doit parfois se défouler.${prompt}
If you aren't in the mood t' scavenge up what I want, you can always cough up gil instead. O' course, that would be quickest.${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit, tu devrais savoir maintenant comment les choses fonctionnent ici. Si tu veux quelque chose, tu dois d'abord m'apporter quelque chose que je veux.${prompt}
Let's make this explanation brief, shall we?${prompt};Si tu n'as pas envie de chercher ce que je veux, tu peux toujours donner des gils à la place. Bien sûr, ce serait plus rapide.${prompt}
You see, prices are a mite different in the Near East. Something that sells for a gil a dozen here might be a luxury item in Aht Urhgan.${prompt};Rendons cette explication brève, d'accord ?${prompt}
Jumping straigh' to the point, now.;Tu vois, les prix sont un peu différents au Proche-Orient. Quelque chose qui se vend une gil la douzaine ici pourrait être un article de luxe à Aht Urhgan.${prompt}
I want you t' bring me some common items from this side o' Vana'diel, and I'll give you the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} in exchange.${prompt};Passons directement au but, maintenant.
The more you bring me, the better. I 'ave put together a few lists if you'd like to take a look. I will leave it t' you which to bring me.${prompt};Je veux que tu m'apportes des articles courants de ce côté de Vana'diel, et je te donnerai ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} en échange.${prompt}
Ah yes, and there is gil, too. Righto.;Plus tu m'apportes, mieux c'est. J'ai préparé quelques listes si tu veux y jeter un œil. Je te laisse choisir quoi m'apporter.${prompt}
You can buy your way out if you choose.${prompt};Ah oui, et il y a aussi les gils, bien sûr.
If you decide t' go the gil route, I will need ${number: 0} gil up front. That's nothing for adventurers nowadays, righ'? You can also consider it your price o' failure, heheh.${prompt};Tu peux acheter ton passage si tu choisis cette option.${prompt}
So what'll it be?;Si tu choisis la route des gils, j’aurai besoin de ${number: 0} gils à l’avance. Ce n’est rien pour les aventuriers de nos jours, n’est-ce pas ? Tu peux aussi considérer cela comme le prix de ton échec, heheh.${prompt}
I'll read the list now, so decide which set is in your budget and make a note o' what you need.${prompt};Alors, qu'est-ce que ce sera ?
What'll it be?;Je vais lire la liste maintenant, décide quel ensemble est dans ton budget et prends note de ce dont tu as besoin.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Qu'est-ce que ce sera ?
Beginner list.;${selection-lines}
Intermediate list.;Liste débutant.
Advanced list.;Liste intermédiaire.
Pay the ${number: 0} gil.;Liste avancée.
Please explain again.;Payer les ${number: 0} gils.
Let me think about it.${prompt};Veuillez expliquer à nouveau.
It's going t' take you some work if you want to go to Aht Urhgan, but you cannot get there through anyone but us.${prompt};Laisse-moi réfléchir.${prompt}
Heh heh heh...${prompt};Ça va te demander du travail si tu veux aller à Aht Urhgan, mais tu ne peux pas y aller autrement que par nous.${prompt}
The advanced list, eh? A superb choice. The items on this list are few, so they should fit nicely in your bag, but they are quite difficult t' come by.;Heh heh heh...${prompt}
You can choose from the following:${prompt};La liste avancée, hein ? Un choix superbe. Les articles sur cette liste sont peu nombreux, donc ils devraient bien tenir dans ton sac, mais ils sont assez difficiles à trouver.
One coffer key from a beastman stronghold--Davoi, Beadeaux, Castle Oztroja, the Temple of Uggalepih, the Den of Rancor, the Quicksand Caves, or the Sea Serpent Grotto.${prompt};Tu peux choisir parmi les suivants:${prompt}
A “testimony.” Those ancient scraps of papyrus seem t' be quite popular with collectors these days. I don't know all the details, but apparently there's a testimony for any o' the jobs an adventurer can be. Anyway, I just need one.${prompt};Une clé de coffre provenant d'un bastion des hommes-bêtes--Davoi, Beadeaux, Château Oztroja, le Temple d'Uggalepih, la Tanière du Rancor, les Cavernes de Sable, ou la Grotte du Serpent de Mer.${prompt}
Your last option is t' bring me chips from Pso'Xja.${prompt};Un “témoignage”. Ces vieux morceaux de papyrus semblent être très populaires auprès des collectionneurs ces jours-ci. Je ne connais pas tous les détails, mais apparemment, il existe un témoignage pour chacun des métiers d'un aventurier. Quoi qu'il en soit, j'ai juste besoin d'un seul.${prompt}
I'll need a set o' those, though. You'll 'ave to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, all three.${prompt};Ta dernière option est de m'apporter des fragments de Pso'Xja.${prompt}
That's it for the advanced list.;J’aurai besoin d’un ensemble de ceux-ci, cependant. Tu devras m’apporter ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, les trois.${prompt}
You can bring me any one o' the above requests, but if you decide t' bring Pso'Xja chips, I'll need 'em in a set o' three.${prompt};C'est tout pour la liste avancée.
Intermediate, eh?;Tu peux m'apporter l'une des requêtes ci-dessus, mais si tu décides d'apporter des fragments de Pso'Xja, il me les faudra en lot de trois.${prompt}
This one is quite a bother.${prompt};Intermédiaire, hein ?
Beastmen 'ave been a real plague t' the Near East as of late. Not that we haven't been having problems here, too.${prompt};Celle-ci est assez ennuyeuse.${prompt}
But anyway, the situation 'as driven up the demand for beastman spoils.${prompt};Les hommes-bêtes ont été un vrai fléau pour le Proche-Orient ces derniers temps. Non pas que nous n'ayons pas eu de problèmes ici aussi.${prompt}
I want you t' bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt};Mais quoi qu'il en soit, la situation a fait monter la demande pour les dépouilles des hommes-bêtes.${prompt}
The beastmen have been using those t' relay orders. I require all three.${prompt};Je veux que tu m’apportes ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}
That's all for the intermediate list.;Les hommes-bêtes les utilisent pour relayer des ordres. J’ai besoin des trois.${prompt}
It may sound simple, but those items are scattered all about the strongholds and are rather difficult t' get a hold of.${prompt};C'est tout pour la liste intermédiaire.
You say you want t' go to Aht Urhgan, but you're too big o' a coward to face a challenge, eh? That attitude will get you nowhere in the Empire, I tell you. Ah well, it's all the same t' me, as long as I make a profit.${prompt};Cela peut sembler simple, mais ces objets sont dispersés dans tous les bastions et sont assez difficiles à obtenir.${prompt}
This will be more like running errands, but there are a lot o' things for you to collect on this list.${prompt};Tu dis vouloir aller à Aht Urhgan, mais tu es trop lâche pour affronter un défi, hein ? Cette attitude ne te mènera nulle part dans l'Empire, je te le dis. Ah bien, c'est tout pareil pour moi, tant que je fais du profit.${prompt}
There are a lot o' curious items here. I need you to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt};Ce sera plus comme des courses, mais il y a beaucoup de choses à collecter sur cette liste.${prompt}
Wait, there's more. I also require ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}.;Il y a beaucoup d’objets curieux ici. Je veux que tu m’apportes ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}.${prompt}
...Oh, and one last thing--${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}. Hand me these six items at one time, and I will be satisfied.${prompt};Attends, il y a plus. J'ai aussi besoin de ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} et de ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]}.
Hoho!;...Oh, et une dernière chose--${article} ${item-article: 5[2]}. Apporte-moi ces six objets en une fois, et je serai satisfait.${prompt}
So this high and mighty adventurer refuses t' be reduced to running errands!${prompt};Hoho !
Ah, sorry abou' that.${wait-36: 1};Alors ce grand et noble aventurier refuse d'être réduit à faire des courses !${prompt}
I'm not picking on you, so don't get your feathers in a ruffle.${prompt};Ah, désolé pour ça.${wait-36: 1}
So you are going t' pay me ${number: 0} gil. Is that correct?${prompt};Je ne te taquine pas, alors ne te mets pas en colère.${prompt}
You won't receive the permit immediately, you know. Are you okay with that?${prompt};Donc tu vas me payer ${number: 0} gils. C’est correct ?${prompt}
Pay ${number: 0} gil for the permit?;Tu ne recevras pas le permis immédiatement, tu sais. Est-ce que ça te va ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Payer ${number: 0} gils pour le permis ?
On second thought, no.;${selection-lines}
Yes.${prompt};En y réfléchissant, non.
You're not going t' regret this later, are you?${prompt};Oui.${prompt}
Be honest.;Tu ne vas pas le regretter plus tard, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Sois honnête.
Now that you mention it...;${selection-lines}
Regret? I know the word not!${prompt};Maintenant que tu le mentionnes...
Blimey! You've only got ${number: 6} gil?${wait-36: 2};Regretter ? Je ne connais pas ce mot !${prompt}
Come back when your pockets are a little heavier!${prompt};Sapristi ! Tu n'as que ${number: 6} gils ?${wait-36: 2}
Congratulations, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am], we have a deal!;Reviens quand tes poches seront un peu plus lourdes !${prompt}
Come back tomorrow and I will give you the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};Félicitations, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame], nous avons un accord !
And don't you worry, because the Tenshodo is true t' its word!${prompt};Reviens demain et je te donnerai le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
${color-alt: 138}You pay Faursel ${number: 0} gil!${prompt};Et ne t'en fais pas, car le Tenshodo est fidèle à sa parole !${prompt}
Exactly what I asked for!;${color-alt: 138}Tu paies Faursel ${number: 0} gils !${prompt}
Congratulations, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am], we have a deal!;Exactement ce que j'ai demandé !
Come back tomorrow and I will give you the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};Félicitations, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame], nous avons un accord !
And don't you worry, because the Tenshodo is true t' its word!${prompt};Reviens demain et je te donnerai le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
What's done is done. Sorry, but I'm not giving any refunds.;Et ne t'en fais pas, car le Tenshodo est fidèle à sa parole !${prompt}
Come back tomorrow and I will give you the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};Ce qui est fait est fait. Désolé, mais je ne fais pas de remboursements.
Good day t' you.;Reviens demain et je te donnerai le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
You can 'ave your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} now!${prompt};Bonne journée à toi.
With this, you can ride t' the Near East from the port at Mhaura.${prompt};Tu peux avoir ton ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} maintenant !${prompt}
I 'ave got t' tell you up front, though, that the high seas are a dangerous place. I can't guarantee your safety, so travel at your own risk.${prompt};Avec ça, tu peux voyager vers le Proche-Orient depuis le port de Mhaura.${prompt}
If I were you, I'd be praying for the ship t' simply stay afloat.${prompt};Je dois vous prévenir dès le départ que les hautes mers sont un endroit dangereux. Je ne peux pas garantir votre sécurité, alors voyagez à vos risques et périls.${prompt}
Heh heh heh...${prompt};Si j'étais à votre place, je prierais pour que le navire reste simplement à flot.${prompt}
With ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you can ride t' the Near East from the port at Mhaura.${prompt};Heh heh heh...${prompt}
Good day t' you.;Avec ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, vous pouvez voyager vers le Proche-Orient depuis le port de Mhaura.${prompt}
I 'ave got your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} here. Unfortunately, I cannot hand it t' you just yet.${prompt};Bonjour à vous.
Righto. Here goes nothing.${prompt};J'ai votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} ici. Malheureusement, je ne peux pas vous le remettre pour le moment.${prompt}
Being o' the Tenshodo, I couldn't accept such an exorbitant price for a simple permit without including some type o' extra service.${prompt};Allons-y.${prompt}
Can you hear me, anyway...?;Étant donné que je fais partie du Tenshodo, je ne pourrais accepter un prix aussi exorbitant pour un simple permis sans inclure un type de service supplémentaire.${prompt}
Well, when you open your eyes, you're in for a surprise. Heheh.${prompt};Est-ce que vous m'entendez, quand même...?
Ah, it's you again.;Eh bien, quand vous ouvrirez les yeux, vous serez surpris. Heheh.${prompt}
Did you make it t' Aht Urhgan in one piece? Sorry for catching you by surprise earlier.${prompt};Ah, c'est encore vous.
I'm not sure if you know this or not, but Aht Urhgan has a pact forbidding airships from flying over their nation.${prompt};Êtes-vous arrivé à Aht Urhgan en un seul morceau ? Désolé de vous avoir pris par surprise plus tôt.${prompt}
O' course, we found a way around that, and dropped you into that ginormous forest from the sky. The Tenshodo'll always give you your money's worth.${prompt};Je ne suis pas sûr que vous le sachiez ou non, mais Aht Urhgan a un pacte interdisant aux aéronefs de survoler leur nation.${prompt}

Buy a storage slip.;Service de porteur ?
No, thank you.${prompt};Acheter un bon pour le stockage.
Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over?;Non, merci.${prompt}
Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.${prompt};Votre gobbiebag déborde-t-il de ses coutures ? Votre Mog Safe déborde-t-il ?
That's where I come in, kupo.;Eh bien, un aventurier accompli comme vous a sûrement plus de choses qu'il ne sait qu'en faire.${prompt}
I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt};C'est là que j'interviens, kupo.
To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of 100,000 gil.${prompt};Je me ferai un plaisir de garder vos biens précieux, vous laissant de l'espace pour rassembler encore de plus grands trésors.${prompt}
Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt};Pour profiter de mes services, vous devrez d’abord acheter l’un de ces bons pour le stockage pour le modique montant de ${number: 19} gils, kupo.${prompt}
You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt};Les bons pour le stockage sont disponibles dans de nombreuses variétés, kupo, chacune correspondant à un type différent d'objet.${prompt}
Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt};Vous voudrez examiner de près les petits caractères, afin de ne pas dépenser de bons gils pour un bout de parchemin inutile pour l'objet particulier que vous souhaitez stocker.${prompt}
Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.;Bien que nous, les moogles, ne nous opposions pas à ce genre de don, kupo.${prompt}
I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt};Choisissez l'objet que vous souhaitez confier, puis échangez-le avec moi ainsi qu'un seul bon pour le stockage.
Invisible to you, at least.;Je prendrai l'objet et vous retournerai le bon, marqué d'un sceau invisible.${prompt}
It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt};Invisible pour vous, du moins.
When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt};C'est clair comme de l'eau de roche pour nous, les moogles, alors ne pensez même pas à essayer de nous berner, kupo.${prompt}
I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.;Lorsqu'il sera temps de récupérer votre objet, échangez simplement avec moi un seul bon pour le stockage -- n'importe quel bon -- une fois de plus.${prompt}

What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!;Aussi simple que cela, kupo !${prompt}
Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt};De plus, aucun frais de transaction supplémentaire ne sera engagé !
Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.;Plutôt généreux de notre part pour une fois, non ?${prompt}
So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt};Maintenant, je parie que vous vous demandez quel est le piège, kupo.
For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt};Pour ne pas vous décevoir, il y en a quelques-uns !${prompt}
Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!;Pour commencer, tous les objets signés perdront leurs signatures si vous les stockez avec moi.${prompt}
It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt};Pourquoi, dites-vous ? Hé, même nous, les moogles, ne sommes pas parfaits !
Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt};Il vaut mieux pour nous deux que vous gardiez vos possessions les plus précieuses à portée de main, kupo.${prompt}
If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!;Maintenant, écoutez bien, car il y a un autre piège, et c'est un gros.${prompt}
No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”;Si vous perdez votre bon pour le stockage, je ne pourrai pas vous rendre votre objet. Jamais. Pas de si, de et de mais !
Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt};"Pas de ""Je suis désolé, Monsieur Moogle Porteur, cela ne se reproduira jamais !"""
Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt};Les règles sont les règles, kupo, et quelqu'un doit les respecter.${prompt}
If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt};Enfin, mais non des moindres, je ne peux pas accepter d'équipement portant l'insigne d'essai de Magian.${prompt}
And that's all there is to it.;Si vous avez un tel objet que vous mourrez d'envie de me confier, vous devrez abandonner votre essai d'abord, kupo.${prompt}

The cards open our eyes to the truth, yet so many still wander aimlessly through life, blind as batarus.${prompt};Oh, quelle honte !
But it doesn't have to be this way!;Les cartes nous ouvrent les yeux sur la vérité, et pourtant tant de gens errent encore sans but dans la vie, aveugles comme des batarus.${prompt}
I just need someone to help me spread the wonders of fortune-wortune-telling across the land!${prompt};Mais cela ne doit pas être ainsi !

Take it with you and visit one of the dungeons from the list that I am about to give you. Which one you visit is your choice.${prompt};Dans le cadre du processus de candidature, vous aurez besoin de ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Our survey staff has inspected each of the areas in question and placed special markings at a particular location past the entrance.${prompt};Prenez-le avec vous et visitez l'un des donjons de la liste que je m'apprête à vous donner. Lequel vous visitez est votre choix.${prompt}

The government of Jeuno has promulgated a system for adventurers to pioneer uncharted lands.${prompt};Je vous souhaite bonne chance dans cette entreprise.${prompt}
This system was proposed by the leaders of the Sacred City of Adoulin, an overseas trading capital whose volume of trade rivals Jeuno's.${prompt};Le gouvernement de Jeuno a promulgué un système permettant aux aventuriers de pionniers des terres inexplorées.${prompt}
Pioneers are to traverse the waters of the Sea of Zafmlug, far to the west, and assist in colonizing the untamed wilds of Ulbuka.${prompt};Ce système a été proposé par les dirigeants de la Ville Sacrée d'Adoulin, une capitale commerciale d'outre-mer dont le volume d'échanges rivalise avec celui de Jeuno.${prompt}
Once word of this proposal reached San d'Oria through various trade routes, it introduced Jeuno to the idea, which led to its eventual implementation.${prompt};Les pionniers sont appelés à traverser les eaux de la Mer de Zafmlug, loin à l'ouest, et à aider à coloniser les terres sauvages d'Ulbuka.${prompt}
Adoulin is not a place for the weak or uninitiated. Harsh wildlands surround the city, and simple layfolk stand no chance of surviving. It is due to these unique circumstances that Adoulin has begun recruiting highly seasoned adventurers to assist in seeing out its goals.${prompt};Lorsque cette proposition est parvenue à San d'Oria par diverses routes commerciales, elle a introduit Jeuno à l'idée, ce qui a conduit à sa mise en œuvre.${prompt}
Here at the Consultation Desk, we issue permits that allow proactive adventurers to cross over to Adoulin.${prompt};Adoulin n'est pas un endroit pour les faibles ou les non-initiés. Des terres sauvages impitoyables entourent la ville, et les simples laïcs n'ont aucune chance de survie. C'est en raison de ces circonstances uniques qu'Adoulin a commencé à recruter des aventuriers hautement expérimentés pour l'aider à atteindre ses objectifs.${prompt}
However, neophytes cannot provide the services Adoulin requires. As such, the Chamber has commissioned a simple test for those seeking to make the perilous journey.${prompt};Ici, au Bureau de Consultation, nous délivrons des permis permettant aux aventuriers proactifs de passer à Adoulin.${prompt}
Those seasoned in battle should find it to be a relatively painless affair.${prompt};Cependant, les néophytes ne peuvent pas fournir les services qu'Adoulin demande. En conséquence, la Chambre a commandé un test simple pour ceux qui souhaitent entreprendre le voyage périlleux.${prompt}
Adoulin has prepared a multitude of ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}, of which one will be given to each adventurer seeking to prove their worth.${prompt};Ceux qui sont chevronnés dans le combat devraient trouver cela relativement indolore.${prompt}
These ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} are attuned to the land, and are able to record markings located in specific locations. Further details will be provided once we have issued you the appropriate certifications.${prompt};Adoulin a préparé une multitude de ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}, dont une sera remise à chaque aventurier cherchant à prouver sa valeur.${prompt}
For the time being, let us return to the task you will have to face.${prompt};Ces ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} sont accordés à la terre et sont capables d’enregistrer des repères situés à des emplacements spécifiques. Des détails supplémentaires seront fournis une fois que nous vous aurons délivré les certifications appropriées.${prompt}
Bring this object with you and take it to one out of a list of several areas located throughout Vana'diel. Which place you choose to explore is for you to decide.${prompt};Pour l'instant, revenons à la tâche que vous aurez à affronter.${prompt}
You must simply pass the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} over the markings located in the area to finish your assignment.${prompt};Apportez cet objet avec vous et emmenez-le dans l'une des plusieurs zones réparties dans tout Vana'diel. Le choix de l'endroit que vous souhaitez explorer vous appartient.${prompt}
Once you have completed this task, simply return the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to us here and we will analyze the results.${prompt};Il vous suffit de passer le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} sur les marques situées dans la zone pour terminer votre mission.${prompt}
Should your trial be completed appropriately, you will be deemed to have passed, and will be issued ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, enabling you to travel to Adoulin.${prompt};Une fois cette tâche terminée, il vous suffit de nous rapporter le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} ici et nous analyserons les résultats.${prompt}
That should constitute a sufficient explanation. Should you choose to undertake the test, I wish you the greatest of fortunes.${prompt};Si votre épreuve est menée à bien, vous serez considéré comme ayant réussi et vous recevrez ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ce qui vous permettra de voyager jusqu’à Adoulin.${prompt}
As you may remember, the test requires you to visit one of several different dungeons.${prompt};Cela devrait constituer une explication suffisante. Si vous choisissez de passer le test, je vous souhaite la meilleure des chances.${prompt}
To be quite frank, we have received a large number of signatures from the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network. Evidently, what with all the adventurers coming and going, they need some help with non-battle activities as well.${prompt};Comme vous vous en souviendrez peut-être, le test consiste à visiter l'un des différents donjons.${prompt}
Given that, the committee deliberated day and night to come up with a solution. As a result of this grueling debacle, an executive decision was made to issue special tickets for the price of ${number: 1} gil.${prompt};Pour être tout à fait franc, nous avons reçu un grand nombre de signatures de la part du Réseau d'Aide Mutuelle des Aventuriers. Manifestement, avec tous les aventuriers qui vont et viennent, ils ont également besoin d'aide pour des activités non combatives.${prompt}
The committee based its judgment on the idea that accumulating funds is yet another sign of a stalwart adventurer.${prompt};Compte tenu de cela, le comité a délibéré jour et nuit pour trouver une solution. À la suite de cette difficile délibération, une décision exécutive a été prise d’émettre des billets spéciaux au prix de ${number: 1} gil.${prompt}
After all, Adoulin is a city of maritime trade, just like our beloved Jeuno. We recognize that it welcomes business skill in all its forms, without regard to race or creed.${prompt};Le comité a fondé son jugement sur l'idée que l'accumulation de fonds est un autre signe d'un aventurier intrépide.${prompt}
As I have previously mentioned, issuing ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} will incur a fee of ${number: 1} gil.${prompt};Après tout, Adoulin est une ville de commerce maritime, tout comme notre bien-aimée Jeuno. Nous reconnaissons qu'elle accueille les compétences commerciales sous toutes leurs formes, sans distinction de race ou de croyance.${prompt}
Begin filling out the paperwork?${prompt};Comme je l’ai mentionné précédemment, l’émission de ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} entraînera des frais de ${number: 1} gil.${prompt}
Pay for the issuance of your documents?;Commencer à remplir les formalités ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Payer pour l'émission de vos documents ?
No time like the present!;${selection-lines}
I need more time to think.${prompt};Il n'y a pas de moment comme le présent !
Are you sure?${prompt};J'ai besoin de plus de temps pour réfléchir.${prompt}
Ready for issuance?;Êtes-vous sûr ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Prêt pour l'émission ?
You bet!;${selection-lines}
Not quite.${prompt};Absolument !
Unfortunately, you do not appear to have the required gil. Please come back once you can pay the handling fee.${prompt};Pas tout à fait.${prompt}
Let me see...dot the I's here, cross the T's there...and...we are finished. Here is your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};Malheureusement, vous ne semblez pas avoir le gil nécessaire. Revenez une fois que vous pourrez payer les frais de traitement.${prompt}
There is one more thing. Take this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} with you.${prompt};Voyons voir... ponctuez les i ici, croisez les t là... et... nous avons terminé. Voici votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
It will let you teleport to Adoulin. You may have noticed that there is a mystic portal located here in Lower Jeuno. That will lead you there.${prompt};Il y a encore une chose. Prenez également ce ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} avec vous.${prompt}
These ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} record founts of power in specific places and allow instantaneous travel between two locations.${prompt};Cela vous permettra de vous téléporter à Adoulin. Vous avez peut-être remarqué qu'il y a un portail mystique situé ici à Basse Jeuno. Celui-ci vous mènera là-bas.${prompt}
I have been informed that this form of transportation is called “warping.”${prompt};Ces ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} enregistrent des sources de puissance en des endroits spécifiques et permettent un voyage instantané entre deux lieux.${prompt}
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} I have presented you with is already attuned to the locus in Lower Jeuno and to Western Adoulin.${prompt};"On m'a informé que cette forme de transport s'appelle le ""warping"".${prompt}"
Passing it over the surface of the portal will enable you to warp to Adoulin.${prompt};Le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} que je vous ai présenté est déjà accordé au lieu à Basse Jeuno et à l’ouest d’Adoulin.${prompt}
"Warping is not free, however; the process requires a certain type of energy.${prompt}";Le faire passer sur la surface du portail vous permettra de vous téléporter à Adoulin.${prompt}
According to my materials, trading crystals to a waypoint will convert them into energy. This process is called “charging.”${prompt};"Cependant, le Warping n'est pas gratuit ; le processus nécessite un certain type d'énergie.${prompt}"
The energy, referred to as “kinetic units,” is recorded on the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} I have given you.${prompt};"Selon mes informations, échanger des cristaux contre un waypoint les convertira en énergie. Ce processus s'appelle le ""charging"".${prompt}"
Utilizing the waypoints will deplete a portion of these kinetic units each time, so I recommend periodic recharging.${prompt};"L’énergie, appelée ""unités cinétiques"", est enregistrée sur le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} que je vous ai donné.${prompt}"
It says here that all I have imparted to you may be reviewed at any time from any waypoint.${prompt};Utiliser les waypoints épuisera une partie de ces unités cinétiques à chaque fois, je recommande donc une recharge périodique.${prompt}
Of course, in consideration of all your help, the one I have given you is fully charged. I hope that you put it to good use.${prompt};Il est indiqué ici que tout ce que je vous ai transmis peut être consulté à tout moment à partir de n'importe quel point de passage.${prompt}
That is all the information with which I can provide you. Your adventures in Adoulin will be what you make of them--and we have high hopes you will make a positive contribution to the development of the nation and the success of the pioneering initiative.${prompt};Bien sûr, en considération de toute votre aide, celui que je vous ai donné est entièrement chargé. J'espère que vous en ferez bon usage.${prompt}
Our records show that you have already declared your desire to participate in the initiative.${prompt};C'est toutes les informations que je peux vous fournir. Vos aventures à Adoulin dépendront de ce que vous en ferez, et nous espérons que vous apporterez une contribution positive au développement de la nation et au succès de l'initiative pionnière.${prompt}
When we issue your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, we will collect your ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}. Make sure you choose your path wisely.${prompt};Nos archives montrent que vous avez déjà déclaré votre désir de participer à l'initiative.${prompt}
Allow me to explain the initiative to you in further detail.${prompt};Lorsque nous émettrons votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, nous collecterons votre ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}. Assurez-vous de choisir votre chemin judicieusement.${prompt}
You wish for me to examine your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, correct? Then please, let me take a look.${prompt};Permettez-moi de vous expliquer l'initiative plus en détail.${prompt}
...${prompt};Vous souhaitez que j’examine votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, n’est-ce pas ? Alors s’il vous plaît, laissez-moi jeter un œil.${prompt}
Having analyzed the sample you retrieved, we are pleased to inform you that you have passed the test.${prompt};...${prompt}
I shall now return your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to you.${prompt};Après avoir analysé l'échantillon que vous avez récupéré, nous sommes heureux de vous informer que vous avez réussi le test.${prompt}
Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is attuned not just to the location you visited, but also to locations throughout Adoulin.${prompt};Je vais maintenant vous rendre votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
We have a task that we would like to request of all adventurers who possess ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt};Votre ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} est accordé non seulement à l’emplacement que vous avez visité, mais aussi à des emplacements à travers Adoulin.${prompt}
This request comes directly from the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, with the reward to be paid out by them as well.${prompt};Nous avons une tâche que nous aimerions demander à tous les aventuriers qui possèdent ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt}
The content of this request is simple. The Association wants adventurers to record loci of power for them using the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. Of course, they are indeed aware that different adventurers will have different wants and priorities.${prompt};Cette demande provient directement du Réseau d'Aide Mutuelle des Aventuriers, avec la récompense à être versée par eux également.${prompt}
In order to support adventurers whose skills are best utilized outside the field of battle, the Association is searching for people to attune these ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} in their stead.${prompt};Le contenu de cette demande est simple. L’Association veut que les aventuriers enregistrent des lieux de pouvoir pour eux en utilisant le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}. Bien sûr, ils sont conscients que différents aventuriers auront des envies et des priorités différentes.${prompt}
Will you accept this task?${prompt};Afin de soutenir les aventuriers dont les compétences sont mieux utilisées en dehors du champ de bataille, l’Association recherche des personnes pour accorder ces ${keyitem-plural: 0[2]} à leur place.${prompt}
How about it?;Acceptez-vous cette tâche ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Qu'en pensez-vous ?

Okay, now listen carefully. The password consists of eight numbers in total, and you need to split it up into four sections of two digits each.${prompt};Very well. As promised, I'll tell you the secret behind the password.${prompt}
First, you need to take the first three letters of your name and use them to generate a series of two-digit numbers based on their position in the alphabet.${prompt};Okay, now listen carefully.

The letter A starts at “00,” B is “01,” and so on, until you reach Z at “25.”${prompt};First, you need to take the first three letters of your name and use them to generate a series of two-digit numbers based on their position in the alphabet.${prompt}
Furthermore, the area containing each device has been assigned an elemental, with each elemental given a numerical code.${prompt};The letter A starts at “00,” B is “01,” and so on, until you reach Z at “25.”${prompt}
If the elemental is Fire, the number is “0,”, while Earth is “1,” until you reach Dark at “7.”${prompt};Furthermore, the area containing each device has been assigned an elemental, with each elemental given a numerical code.${prompt}
Next, you need to take the value for the elemental and add it to each of your first three numbers. That will give you the first three values.${prompt};If the elemental is Fire, the number is “0,”, while Earth is “1,” until you reach Dark at “7.”${prompt}
For the fourth value, you need to add your first three values together and then add the elemental value as well.${prompt};Next, you need to take the value for the elemental and add it to each of your first three numbers. That will give you the first three values.${prompt}
If the number exceeds 100, simply take the last two digits.${prompt};For the fourth value, you need to add your first three values together and then add the elemental value as well.${prompt}
Therefore, these four sets of numbers you calculated will become your eight-digit password.${prompt};If the number exceeds 100, simply take the last two digits.${prompt}
I suppose it's still a bit difficult to comprehend. How about an example, then? Say you're trying to register the password in ${zone: 1[2]}...${prompt};Therefore, these four sets of numbers you calculated will become your eight-digit password.${prompt}

How about an example, then? Say you're trying to register the password in ${zone: 1[2]}...${prompt}
Therefore, the numerical values for your name are ${number-2-digits: 0}, ${number-2-digits: 1}, and ${number-2-digits: 2}, and the elemental value is ${number: 3}.${prompt};The first three letters of your name are ${entity: 0}, and the elemental for the device is ${choice: 6}[Fire/Earth/Water/Wind/Ice/Lightning/Light/Dark]...${prompt}

Ya know, to keep up wit' the times and all.${prompt};The Festival of Brave Souls is always a sad affair, so I thought it'd be good to prepare somethin' a bit more lighthearted.

However, she was much weaker than I expected...${prompt};So I put out a call for a skilled entertainer and that girl showed up.${prompt}

Ah, ${name-player}!;I understand your frustration, but this story was written for us by a famous Goblin author.${prompt}
I'm glad you're here!${prompt};Ah, ${name-player}!
You know my show that was scheduled for the Festival of Brave Souls?${prompt};I'm glad you're here!${prompt}

First of all, who is this Fantastox person!?;Get this, they're calling it the “Mighty Maiden Fantastox Heroine Stage Show”!${prompt}
My name is Mumor!${prompt};First of all, who is this Fantastox person!?
Fantastox's a famous Goblin thief.;My name is Mumor!${prompt}

Actually, we need ya to play the evil villain that's tryin' to steal Mighty Maiden Fantastox's mask.${prompt};So I'm supposed to team up with this thief against the enemy, right!?${prompt}
Why would I want to steal some girl's mask?;Actually, we need ya to play the evil villain that's tryin' to steal Mighty Maiden Fantastox's mask.${prompt}
That's a bit weird, don't you think?${prompt};Why would I want to steal some girl's mask?
In the story, it's a special mask that's got the power to turn boulders into bombs.${prompt};That's a bit weird, don't you think?${prompt}
And what am I supposed to do with something like that!?;In the story, it's a special mask that's got the power to turn boulders into bombs.${prompt}
Although, I guess a show is always better if it has explosions in it...${prompt};And what am I supposed to do with something like that!?
I know, right?;Although, I guess a show is always better if it has explosions in it...${prompt}
We're gonna use smoke to simulate the explosion and set the stage.${prompt};I know, right?
I get it!;We're gonna use smoke to simulate the explosion and set the stage.${prompt}
So that's when I appear as Mighty Maiden Mumor and sing my new song!?${prompt};I get it!
Exactly! Due to your actions, the world finds itself on the brink of destruction...;So that's when I appear as Mighty Maiden Mumor and sing my new song!?${prompt}
But that's when Fantastox rises up to resume the fight!${prompt};Exactly! Due to your actions, the world finds itself on the brink of destruction...
Wait, what!?;But that's when Fantastox rises up to resume the fight!${prompt}
You're totally making me out to be the villain here!${prompt};Wait, what!?
Yeah, that's the point.;You're totally making me out to be the villain here!${prompt}
I've been tellin' ya that from the very beginning.${prompt};Oui, c'est ça.
Hey, it's ${name-player}!;Je vous le dis depuis le tout début.${prompt}
What are you doing here!?${prompt};Hé, c'est ${name-player} !
Ah! It's the brave hero, Gloom Phantom!${prompt};Que fais-tu ici !?${prompt}
Brave hero...?${prompt};Ah ! C'est le brave héros, Gloom Phantom !${prompt}
I came as soon as I received your message!${prompt};Brave héros... ?${prompt}
So the “World Eater Egg” was found right in the middle of Jeuno!${prompt};Je suis venu dès que j'ai reçu votre message !${prompt}
That's right.;Donc l'« Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes » a été trouvé en plein cœur de Jeuno !${prompt}
Before anyone realized it was the “World Eater Egg,” it went from being in a Goblin's capable hands to someone eating it...${prompt};C'est exact.
Wha!? The shell was cracked open without needing my sword!?${prompt};Avant que quiconque ne réalise qu'il s'agissait de l'« Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes », il est passé des mains capables d'un gobelin à quelqu'un qui l'a mangé...${prompt}
Yeah, it's a total mystery.;Quoi !? La coquille s'est cassée sans avoir besoin de mon épée !?${prompt}
It's also unclear where this “World Eater Egg” originally came from.${prompt};Oui, c'est un véritable mystère.
The World Eater...Egg...?${prompt};On ne sait pas non plus d'où venait cet « Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes » à l'origine.${prompt}
Ultimately, it was that girl there who gave the egg to the man known as Maat, who then promptly ate it.${prompt};L'Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes... ?${prompt}
W-well, I, uh...;Au final, c'est cette fille là-bas qui a donné l'œuf à l'homme connu sous le nom de Maat, qui l'a ensuite mangé sans plus tarder.${prompt}
He told me he was hungry, and so I simply brought him ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} I found nearby...${prompt};Euh... eh bien, je...
What I want to know is where was the egg before that?${prompt};Il m'a dit qu'il avait faim, alors j'ai simplement apporté ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} que j'ai trouvé à proximité...${prompt}
I don't know the details, but I heard a monster near Delkfutt's Tower was carryin' it.${prompt};Ce que je veux savoir, c'est où était l'œuf avant cela ?${prompt}
Delkfutt?;Je ne connais pas les détails, mais j'ai entendu qu'un monstre près de la Tour de Delkfutt le transportait.${prompt}
Where have I heard that name before...${prompt};Delkfutt ?
Delkfutt's Tower is on Qufim Island, which is in Gigas territory.;Où ai-je déjà entendu ce nom...${prompt}
Clearly, certain death awaits us there.${prompt};La Tour de Delkfutt se trouve sur l'île de Qufim, qui est sur le territoire des Gigas.
Can I ask for your help in this matter, brave hero?${prompt};Il est clair que la mort certaine nous attend là-bas.${prompt}
That's why I'm here!;Puis-je demander votre aide dans cette affaire, brave héros ?${prompt}
Leave everything to us!${prompt};C'est pourquoi je suis là !
Hmm... Maybe one of the Gigas knows about the egg and the monster that had it...${prompt};Laissez tout nous à nous !${prompt}
I got it!;Hmm... Peut-être qu'un des Gigas sait quelque chose sur l'œuf et le monstre qui l'avait...${prompt}
We'll go to Qufim Island and capture one of the Gigas there and question it!${prompt};J'ai compris !
You can help us too, ${name-player}!${prompt};Nous irons sur l'île de Qufim et capturerons l'un des Gigas là-bas pour l'interroger !${prompt}
Will you help?;Vous pouvez aussi nous aider, ${name-player} !${prompt}
${selection-lines};Allez-vous nous aider ?
Sure, count me in!;${selection-lines}
Sorry, I'm busy.${prompt};Bien sûr, comptez sur moi !
Naturally, Dazbog and Magh Bihu'll be going to Qufim Island as well!${prompt};Désolé, je suis occupé.${prompt}
Where's your sense of adventure!?${prompt};Bien sûr, Dazbog et Magh Bihu se rendront également sur l'île de Qufim !${prompt}
Dazbog and Magh Bihu'll be going to Qufim Island too, so there's no need to be afraid!${prompt};Où est passée votre soif d'aventure !?${prompt}
Okay, we'll be waiting for you in front of Delkfutt's Tower!${prompt};Dazbog et Magh Bihu se rendront également sur l'île de Qufim, alors pas besoin d'avoir peur !${prompt}
It's rare that you meet such a mighty hero in person.;D'accord, nous vous attendrons devant la Tour de Delkfutt !${prompt}
There aren't many who can draw others to their cause so effortlessly.${prompt};C'est rare de rencontrer un tel héros puissant en personne.
As for you...;Il n'y en a pas beaucoup qui peuvent attirer les autres à leur cause aussi facilement.${prompt}
"I believe people called ya ""that horror from the holdfast"" before, yes?${prompt}";Quant à vous...
So clearly, that makes ya the perfect villain for our story.${prompt};"Je crois que les gens vous appelaient ""cette horreur de la tour"" auparavant, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}"
I resent that remark!;Donc clairement, cela fait de vous le parfait méchant pour notre histoire.${prompt}
You obviously don't know what's important in a Heroine Stage Show!${prompt};Je prends cela comme une insulte !
Wh-what did you say!?${prompt};Vous ne savez évidemment pas ce qui est important dans un spectacle de l'héroïne !${prompt}
If you don't know how a show is supposed to resonate with its fans, then I guess I'll just have to teach you!${prompt};Q-quoi avez-vous dit !?${prompt}
Phew! That was intense.${prompt};Si vous ne savez pas comment un spectacle est censé résonner avec ses fans, alors je suppose que je vais juste devoir vous enseigner !${prompt}
She said she's goin' back home to grab an old script or somethin' like that.${prompt};Ouf ! C'était intense.${prompt}
I think I'd better take this chance to get as far away from here as possible...${prompt};Elle a dit qu'elle rentrerait chez elle chercher un vieux script ou quelque chose comme ça.${prompt}
As for you, you need to go help Gloom Phantom at Delkfutt's Tower on Qufim Island.;Je crois qu'il vaudrait mieux que je saisisse cette chance pour m'éloigner d'ici le plus loin possible...${prompt}
Got it?${prompt};En ce qui vous concerne, vous devez aller aider Gloom Phantom à la Tour de Delkfutt sur l'île de Qufim.
So anyway, that Gigas known as Echion knew some things, but not others.${prompt};Vous avez compris ?${prompt}
I see...;Quoi qu'il en soit, ce Gigas nommé Echion connaissait certaines choses, mais pas d'autres.${prompt}
Although, we still don't know how the “World Eater Egg” was cracked open without using your sword.${prompt};Je vois...
Indeed. Not even the undead themselves should be able to break it open.${prompt};Bien que, nous ne savons toujours pas comment l'“Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes” a été ouvert sans utiliser ton épée.${prompt}
However, they do seem to have the ability to find the “World Eater Egg.”${prompt};En effet. Même les morts-vivants eux-mêmes ne devraient pas pouvoir l'ouvrir.${prompt}
Still, I'm amazed by the Gigas's stupidity.;Cependant, ils semblent avoir la capacité de trouver l'“Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes”.${prompt}
This all happened because they found the “World Eater Egg” and just let it be.${prompt};Néanmoins, je suis stupéfait par la stupidité des Gigas.
They just ignore whatever we have to say!${prompt};Tout cela est arrivé parce qu'ils ont trouvé l'“Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes” et l'ont laissé tranquille.${prompt}
Furthermore, they have no idea just how terrifying Chaos truly is!${prompt};Ils ignorent simplement tout ce que nous avons à dire !${prompt}
Five thousand years ago, the one known as Chaos sought to destroy all that was new, even the world itself...${prompt};De plus, ils ne se rendent pas compte à quel point Chaos est vraiment terrifiant !${prompt}
That included Goblins, Yagudo, Orcs, Quadav...;Il y a cinq mille ans, celui connu sous le nom de Chaos cherchait à détruire tout ce qui était nouveau, même le monde lui-même...${prompt}
Anything that was different from itself.;Cela incluait les Gobelins, les Yagudo, les Orcs, les Quadav...
A great number of species went extinct before the strongest of those that remained banded together.;Tout ce qui était différent de lui-même.
The Gigas feel that way because during the battle against Chaos five thousand years ago, they hadn't even been born yet.${prompt};Un grand nombre d'espèces se sont éteintes avant que les plus forts de ceux qui restaient ne se rassemblent.
So there's no way they could've known about the hatred from those that were devoured by Chaos.${prompt};Les Gigas se sentent ainsi parce que lors de la bataille contre Chaos il y a cinq mille ans, ils n'étaient même pas encore nés.${prompt}
Well, I don't like how they don't believe us just because they haven't seen something themselves.${prompt};Donc, il est impossible qu'ils aient pu connaître la haine de ceux qui ont été dévorés par Chaos.${prompt}
By the way, about that undead who was carrying the World Eater Egg...${prompt};Eh bien, je n'aime pas qu'ils ne nous croient pas juste parce qu'ils n'ont pas vu quelque chose eux-mêmes.${prompt}
Is the mage known as Garazu-Horeizu that can control the undead involved somehow?${prompt};Au fait, à propos de ce mort-vivant qui transportait l'Œuf Dévoreur de Mondes...${prompt}
Actually, we don't really know the answer to that ourselves.${prompt};Le mage connu sous le nom de Garazu-Horeizu qui peut contrôler les morts-vivants est-il impliqué d'une manière ou d'une autre ?${prompt}
Well, someone must know something!${prompt};En fait, nous ne connaissons pas vraiment la réponse à cela nous-mêmes.${prompt}
M-maybe this one here knows s-something?${prompt};Eh bien, quelqu'un doit bien savoir quelque chose !${prompt}
How about Garazu-Horeizu and Chaos?;P-peut-être que celui-ci sait q-quelque chose ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Que penses-tu de Garazu-Horeizu et Chaos ?
The book on maelstrom theory...?;${selection-lines}
The Fourth Yagudo War...?;Le livre sur la théorie des tourbillons... ?
Sorry, I forgot.${prompt};La Quatrième Guerre Yagudo... ?
What do you mean you forgot!?;Désolé, j'ai oublié.${prompt}
I'm gonna yank your petals out myself!${prompt};Comment ça, tu as oublié !?
How about Garazu-Horeizu and Chaos?;Je vais t'arracher tes pétales moi-même !${prompt}
${selection-lines};Que penses-tu de Garazu-Horeizu et Chaos ?
Like the maelstrom theory?;${selection-lines}
How about the Yagudo War?;Comme la théorie du tourbillon ?
Was it the “new discoveries”?${prompt};Que dirais-tu de la Guerre Yagudo ?
Hmm... I'm not sure if that makes it any clearer or not.${prompt};Était-ce les “découvertes nouvelles” ?${prompt}
I think I got a pretty good idea.;Hmm... Je ne suis pas sûr si ça rend les choses plus claires ou non.${prompt}
We can have Dazbog explain the rest later.${prompt};Je pense que j'ai une assez bonne idée.
Th-that's fine, but we still haven't solved the m-mystery yet...${prompt};On peut demander à Dazbog d'expliquer le reste plus tard.${prompt}
We haven't!?${prompt};C-c'est bien, mais nous n'avons toujours pas résolu le mystère...${prompt}
C-clearly, Garazu-Horeizu wanted info on Chaos in order to l-learn a new kind of magic.${prompt};Nous ne l'avons pas !?${prompt}
H-he looked into Chaos even after his death and journey to V-Valhalla...${prompt};C-clairement, Garazu-Horeizu voulait des informations sur Chaos afin d'apprendre un nouveau type de magie.${prompt}
B-but Chaos was defeated in Valhalla...${prompt};I-il a enquêté sur Chaos même après sa mort et son voyage à V-Valhalla...${prompt}
Yeah, that's right!;M-mais Chaos a été vaincu à Valhalla...${prompt}
Odin dealt the finishing blow personally!${prompt};Oui, c'est vrai !
Wait, I thought it was a brave Goblin hero that delivered that blow five thousand years ago?${prompt};Odin a porté le coup final en personne !${prompt}
Huh? In the battle for the Middle Lands, it was my ancestor who dealt the finishing blow.${prompt};Attends, je croyais que c'était un brave héros gobelin qui avait porté ce coup il y a cinq mille ans ?${prompt}
However, Chaos was no ordinary opponent.${prompt};Hein ? Dans la bataille pour les Terres du Milieu, c'est mon ancêtre qui a porté le coup final.${prompt}
Chaos was resurrected in a world beyond this one...${prompt};Cependant, Chaos n'était pas un adversaire ordinaire.${prompt}
So my ancestor and numerous other brave warriors journeyed to Valhalla and continued the fight, even beyond death.${prompt};Chaos a été ressuscité dans un monde au-delà de celui-ci...${prompt}
Ah, so those are the warriors whose death we mourn as part of the Festival of Brave Souls.${prompt};Ainsi, mon ancêtre et de nombreux autres vaillants guerriers ont voyagé jusqu'à Valhalla et ont poursuivi le combat, même après la mort.${prompt}
So at the very end, Odin dealt the final blow.${prompt};Ah, ce sont donc les guerriers dont nous pleurons la mort dans le cadre du Festival des Braves Âmes.${prompt}
Hmm... So clearly, Chaos met its end long, long ago.${prompt};Ainsi, à la toute fin, c'est Odin qui a porté le coup final.${prompt}
That's a relief.;Hmm... Donc clairement, Chaos a trouvé sa fin il y a bien longtemps.${prompt}
I was worried about what I'd do if Chaos was still alive today.${prompt};C'est un soulagement.
It's not just me, either. All Goblins carry this sense of dread.;J'étais inquiet de ce que je ferais si Chaos était encore en vie aujourd'hui.${prompt}
That's why we started the Festival of Brave Souls.${prompt};Ce n'est pas juste moi non plus. Tous les gobelins ressentent cette crainte.
I wholeheartedly support this festival as well!${prompt};C'est pourquoi nous avons commencé le Festival des Braves Âmes.${prompt}
I've got it!;Je soutiens entièrement ce festival aussi !${prompt}
We can call it the “Mighty Maidens Heroine Stage Show: Remember the Battle against Chaos”!${prompt};Je l'ai !
Say that again?${prompt};On peut l'appeler le “Spectacle de Scène Héroïque des Mighty Maidens : Souvenez-vous de la Bataille contre Chaos” !${prompt}
It's a show we can put on at the Festival of Brave Souls!${prompt};Répète ça ?${prompt}
Or, we can simplify the name a bit and just call it the “Mighty Maidens Heroine Stage Show: Defeat Chaos”!${prompt};C'est un spectacle que nous pouvons présenter lors du Festival des Braves Âmes !${prompt}
What is she talking about!?${prompt};Ou, nous pouvons simplifier un peu le nom et l’appeler simplement le “Spectacle de Scène Héroïque des Mighty Maidens : Vaincre Chaos” !${prompt}
She's not happy with the show for the festival, so she's been trying to convince me to change it.${prompt};De quoi elle parle !?${prompt}
You're right...;Elle n'est pas satisfaite du spectacle pour le festival, donc elle essaie de me convaincre de le changer.${prompt}
She's been here the whole time.${prompt};Tu as raison...
It came to me after hearing all of you talk!${prompt};Elle est là depuis le début.${prompt}
This evil being known as Chaos tried to eradicate anyone who was different from it, so various beings worked together to oppose it, right?${prompt};Cela m'est venu après vous avoir tous entendus parler !${prompt}
And afterwards, this enemy rose up once again to put the land in danger!;Cet être maléfique connu sous le nom de Chaos a essayé d'éradiquer quiconque était différent de lui, donc diverses créatures ont travaillé ensemble pour s'y opposer, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
This story has it all--a real tearjerker followed by everyone living happily ever after!${prompt};Et ensuite, cet ennemi s'est levé de nouveau pour mettre la terre en danger !
A story like that contains everything that fans want to see in a Heroine Stage Show!${prompt};Cette histoire a tout ce qu'il faut - de vraies larmes, suivies de tout le monde vivant heureux pour toujours !${prompt}
First: everyone is made stronger due to their differences!${prompt};Une histoire comme celle-là contient tout ce que les fans veulent voir dans un spectacle de scène héroïque !${prompt}
Second: they overcome their differences and work together!${prompt};Premièrement: tout le monde devient plus fort grâce à leurs différences !${prompt}
Third: there are moments of sadness, but people rise up in a spirit of hope!${prompt};Deuxièmement: ils surmontent leurs différences et travaillent ensemble !${prompt}
Hmm... When you put it like that...${prompt};Troisièmement: il y a des moments de tristesse, mais les gens se relèvent dans un esprit d’espoir !${prompt}
Furthermore, once everyone sees the show, they won't be like the Gigas and not believe in something because they've never seen it before!${prompt};Hmm... Quand on le dit comme ça...${prompt}
Yes, I suppose you have a point...${prompt};De plus, une fois que tout le monde aura vu le spectacle, ils ne seront pas comme les Gigas et ne croiront pas en quelque chose parce qu'ils ne l'ont jamais vu auparavant !${prompt}
Okay! I'll give it some thought!${prompt};Oui, je suppose que tu as raison...${prompt}
You will!?${prompt};D'accord ! J'y réfléchirai sérieusement !${prompt}
However, in regards to Valhalla...${prompt};Vraiment !?${prompt}
Chaos may have hidden the egg before its death.${prompt};Cependant, en ce qui concerne Valhalla...${prompt}
Yes, that's totally possible!;Le Chaos a peut-être caché l'œuf avant sa mort.${prompt}
However, I think Odin would've noticed...${prompt};Oui, c'est totalement possible !
Maybe his nose was stuffed up, or he had something else on his mind at the time.${prompt};Cependant, je pense qu'Odin aurait remarqué...${prompt}
I-it's definitely a mystery...;Peut-être que son nez était bouché, ou qu'il avait autre chose en tête à ce moment-là.${prompt}
I wish I could ask Odin p-personally.${prompt};C'est vraiment un mystère...
Wha!? You realize that means you'd have to be dead, right!?${prompt};J'aimerais pouvoir demander à Odin personnellement.${prompt}
Of course I don't want to die, but I don't want to go back to Hazhalm either!${prompt};Quoi !? Tu réalises que cela signifie que tu devrais être morte, n'est-ce pas !?${prompt}
I-in that case, we could always ask one of Odin's demons...${prompt};Bien sûr que je ne veux pas mourir, mais je ne veux pas non plus retourner à Hazhalm !${prompt}
Oh! You're right! That's a great idea!${prompt};D-dans ce cas, on pourrait toujours demander à l'un des démons d'Odin...${prompt}
Is there one that we can easily talk to?${prompt};Oh ! Tu as raison ! C'est une excellente idée !${prompt}
There are a few like that here in Jeuno.;Y en a-t-il un avec qui nous pouvons facilement parler ?${prompt}
They're disguised as regular people.${prompt};Il y en a quelques-uns ici à Jeuno.
Okay then! Let's get going!${prompt};Ils se déguisent en personnes ordinaires.${prompt}
After hearing that girl's excitement, I've decided to give her proposal some serious thought.${prompt};D'accord alors ! Allons-y !${prompt}
With a show based on the battle against Chaos, we can reach people that might not know anything about it.${prompt};Après avoir entendu l'enthousiasme de cette fille, j'ai décidé de prendre sérieusement en considération sa proposition.${prompt}
The problem is what role can I have her play...;Avec un spectacle basé sur la bataille contre le Chaos, nous pouvons toucher des gens qui pourraient ne rien savoir à ce sujet.${prompt}
Hmm... What if she played Chaos...?${prompt};Le problème est quel rôle je peux lui faire jouer...
