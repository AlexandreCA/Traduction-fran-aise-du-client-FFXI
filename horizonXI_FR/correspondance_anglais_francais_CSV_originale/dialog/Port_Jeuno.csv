With the airships connecting Jeuno with the three nations, the flow of goods has become much more consistent. Nowadays, everything comes through Jeuno!${prompt};Le vol à destination de ${choice: 3}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Kazham] ${choice: 2}[arrive/part].${prompt}
Of course, Jeuno is situated smack-dab in the middle of the three, so this town was destined to grow and prosper.${prompt};Avec les dirigeables reliant Jeuno aux trois nations, le flux de marchandises est devenu beaucoup plus régulier. De nos jours, tout passe par Jeuno !${prompt}
I think the airships are a subtle form of pressure on the other three nations. That way, Jeuno can maintain the current balance of power.${prompt};Bien sûr, Jeuno est située en plein milieu des trois, donc cette ville était destinée à croître et prospérer.${prompt}
Nobody would want to upset the masters of such advanced technology, would they? Nope, can't blame Jeuno for keeping the secrets of airship-building to itself.${prompt};Je pense que les dirigeables sont une forme subtile de pression sur les trois autres nations. Ainsi, Jeuno peut maintenir l’équilibre actuel du pouvoir.${prompt}
This leads to departures. You'll need ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} and ${number: 0} gil to board.${prompt};Personne ne voudrait contrarier les maîtres d'une technologie aussi avancée, n’est-ce pas ?

I can't believe those boats without wings can fly. I'll never ride on such a thing, so I walk everywhere.${prompt};Profitez bien de votre séjour à Jeuno !${prompt}
I'm sure they're a fine way to get around, but the whole concept seems fake to me.${prompt};Je n'arrive pas à croire que ces bateaux sans ailes puissent voler. Je ne monterai jamais là-dedans, alors je marche partout.${prompt}
I lost my ticket, and now I can't get on board. It takes so long to get a new one! I hope you never have to go through this.${prompt};Je suis sûr que c'est un bon moyen de se déplacer, mais tout ce concept me semble faux.${prompt}
Would you care to see a map of Jeuno?${prompt};J'ai perdu mon billet, et maintenant je ne peux pas monter à bord. Ça prend tellement de temps pour en obtenir un nouveau ! J'espère que vous n'aurez jamais à vivre ça.${prompt}

I've heard the archduke issues them now and then, but the chances of getting one that way are slim.${prompt};Vous pouvez embarquer avec ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} de la Chambre de Commerce et de l’Industrie à Basse Jeuno, mais ils sont prohibitivement chers.${prompt}
Port Jeuno must remain secure. After all, if anything happened to the archduke, it would change the world!${prompt};J'ai entendu dire que l’archiduc en distribue de temps en temps, mais les chances d’en obtenir ainsi sont minces.${prompt}
Have you ever flown on an airship? I'm sure you'll be amazed. With the clouds at your feet, you feel like a soaring eagle.${prompt};Port Jeuno doit rester sécurisé. Après tout, si quelque chose arrivait à l'archiduc, cela changerait le monde !${prompt}

Somebody just tried to smuggle in some contraband. You should watch out for scum like that.${prompt};Toute la lutte et la peine en bas semblent mesquines depuis de telles hauteurs. Oh, comme je voudrais que nous soyons nés avec des ailes !${prompt}

Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.;It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.${prompt}
The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt};Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results.
This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call “fewell.”;The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.${prompt}
