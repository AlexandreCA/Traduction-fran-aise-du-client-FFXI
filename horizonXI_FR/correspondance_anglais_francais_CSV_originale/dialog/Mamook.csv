But let me just say one thing before I go...${prompt};Now scram, sweetcheeks. We men've got important business to attend to.${prompt}
If you come back a frog...${prompt};Ugh! I don't know why I put up with you!${prompt}
...you won't be getting any more sugar from this candy cane!${prompt};But let me just say one thing before I go...${prompt}
What's with her?${prompt};If you come back a frog...${prompt}
I was kind of hoping that if I was stuck as a frog, she'd kiss me and I'd magically transform back to normal...just like in that fairy tale.${prompt};...you won't be getting any more sugar from this candy cane!${prompt}
<Grumble, grumble>...${prompt};What's with her?${prompt}
Ah! Oh! A thousand apologies, Professor Chanoix!${prompt};I was kind of hoping that if I was stuck as a frog, she'd kiss me and I'd magically transform back to normal...just like in that fairy tale.${prompt}
Mikilulu obviously cannot fathom the importance of your research (or the reward that accompanies it).${prompt};<Grumble, grumble>...${prompt}
You don't need to worry, sir! I'm still your loyal servant!${prompt};Ah! Oh! A thousand apologies, Professor Chanoix!${prompt}
Though I'm unworthy to even kneel in the light of your zoological greatness...${prompt};Mikilulu obviously cannot fathom the importance of your research (or the reward that accompanies it).${prompt}
...I'll be the best guinea toad you've ever worked with!${prompt};You don't need to worry, sir! I'm still your loyal servant!${prompt}
That's the spirit, Salwa-Molwa! I'm counting on you!${prompt};Though I'm unworthy to even kneel in the light of your zoological greatness...${prompt}
Now, as for our rendezvous point. Are you familiar with the secret exit to the Wajaom Woodlands?${prompt};...I'll be the best guinea toad you've ever worked with!${prompt}
I shall be waiting there for the both of you.${prompt};That's the spirit, Salwa-Molwa! I'm counting on you!${prompt}
And do not be late!${prompt};Now, as for our rendezvous point. Are you familiar with the secret exit to the Wajaom Woodlands?${prompt}
Hey, mercenary-${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady], I know you probably took this job for the reward, but I'd like to ask you...${prompt};I shall be waiting there for the both of you.${prompt}
Do you think there's anything in this world more important than money?${prompt};And do not be late!${prompt}
Well do you?;Hey, mercenary-${choice-player-gender}[guy/lady], I know you probably took this job for the reward, but I'd like to ask you...${prompt}
${selection-lines};Do you think there's anything in this world more important than money?${prompt}
Yeah. Puppies are pretty nice.;Well do you?
No. Even puppies pale to money.${prompt};${selection-lines}
You see...;Yeah. Puppies are pretty nice.
When this job's over, I'm going to ask my sweetheart Mikilulu to marry me.${prompt};No. Even puppies pale to money.${prompt}
That's why I'm going through with this. I'm not doing it for the money like I said.${prompt};You see...
It's just, I can't tell Mikilulu that yet.${prompt};When this job's over, I'm going to ask my sweetheart Mikilulu to marry me.${prompt}
Getting married is a serious thing, but I don't think I'm ready yet. I'm still the same, weak boy that got his butt kicked on the Ballista courts back at boarding school.${prompt};That's why I'm going through with this. I'm not doing it for the money like I said.${prompt}
Before I even try to prove to Miki that I can protect her, I have to prove to myself that I can.${prompt};It's just, I can't tell Mikilulu that yet.${prompt}
See? I know what I'm doing! I just wish Miki understood as well...${prompt};Getting married is a serious thing, but I don't think I'm ready yet. I'm still the same, weak boy that got his butt kicked on the Ballista courts back at boarding school.${prompt}
I mean, I can see why she is worried and all, but I didn't think she would be so unreasonable!${prompt};Before I even try to prove to Miki that I can protect her, I have to prove to myself that I can.${prompt}
I guess I could sit her down and explain everything, but then she'd just get all teary-eyed like she always does...${prompt};See? I know what I'm doing! I just wish Miki understood as well...${prompt}
Oh, sorry about that.${prompt};I mean, I can see why she is worried and all, but I didn't think she would be so unreasonable!${prompt}
I didn't mean to put any extra pressure on you or anything. (Though, Miki would be devastated if anything were to happen to me on this mission...)${prompt};I guess I could sit her down and explain everything, but then she'd just get all teary-eyed like she always does...${prompt}
Anyway, Miki's happiness is riding on my performance here.${prompt};Oh, sorry about that.${prompt}
And if I have to become a frog thirty times over to prove my love to her, then so be it!${prompt};I didn't mean to put any extra pressure on you or anything. (Though, Miki would be devastated if anything were to happen to me on this mission...)${prompt}
Once you've made your preparations, you know where to meet me and the B.${prompt};Anyway, Miki's happiness is riding on my performance here.${prompt}
See you around!${prompt};And if I have to become a frog thirty times over to prove my love to her, then so be it!${prompt}
Ah, quite punctual of you, ${name-player}.${prompt};Once you've made your preparations, you know where to meet me and the B.${prompt}
“As swift as a raptor,” one might say.${prompt};See you around!${prompt}
I should expect nothing less from a seasoned mercenary like yourself.${prompt};Ah, quite punctual of you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
Now, if only all my help were as competent...${prompt};“As swift as a raptor,” one might say.${prompt}
Where on Vana'diel could that nimwit be!?${prompt};I should expect nothing less from a seasoned mercenary like yourself.${prompt}
You're late, ${name-player}! “As laggard as a wamouracampa,” one might say.${prompt};Now, if only all my help were as competent...${prompt}
And you call yourself a mercenary... It is a wonder the Empire can thrive when protected by such a pitiful army of skivers.${prompt};Where on Vana'diel could that nimwit be!?${prompt}
If you were working with my research team, you'd be fired before you stepped in the door. Why, you even make that assistant of mine, Atelloune, look like the Goddess Herself!${prompt};You're late, ${name-player}! “As laggard as a wamouracampa,” one might say.${prompt}
And it seems your tendency towards tardiness is not necessarily a unique trait...${prompt};And you call yourself a mercenary... It is a wonder the Empire can thrive when protected by such a pitiful army of skivers.${prompt}
Late! Late! Late!;If you were working with my research team, you'd be fired before you stepped in the door. Why, you even make that assistant of mine, Atelloune, look like the Goddess Herself!${prompt}
I'm gonna be lataru!;And it seems your tendency towards tardiness is not necessarily a unique trait...${prompt}
Ulp! You guys haven't been waiting too long for me, I hope.${prompt};Late! Late! Late!
Ahem!;I'm gonna be lataru!
I apologize deeply for my delayed arrival, and humbly beg your forgiveness.${prompt};Ulp! You guys haven't been waiting too long for me, I hope.${prompt}
Salwa the Unworthy, at your service.${prompt};Ahem!
I would've been here earlier, but I thought we were supposed to meet at the exit to Bhaflau!;I apologize deeply for my delayed arrival, and humbly beg your forgiveness.${prompt}
Fool!${prompt};Salwa the Unworthy, at your service.${prompt}
How many times have I told you, I am not a man to be kept waiting!${prompt};I would've been here earlier, but I thought we were supposed to meet at the exit to Bhaflau!
Or perhaps you thought we were going on a picnic to the countryside?${prompt};Fool!${prompt}
Look at this fine mercenary, all ready to embark on our important mission. At least one of you has some sense of responsibility.${prompt};How many times have I told you, I am not a man to be kept waiting!${prompt}
Do not forget, Salwa-Molwa, there are thousands more Tarutaru where you came from. I'm sure I can find another to assist me!${prompt};Or perhaps you thought we were going on a picnic to the countryside?${prompt}
I-I'm sorry, Your Professorship! Please forgive me! It won't happen again!${prompt};Look at this fine mercenary, all ready to embark on our important mission. At least one of you has some sense of responsibility.${prompt}
You are lucky I don't bend you across my knee and give you a good flogging! Maybe that would teach you a lesson!${prompt};Do not forget, Salwa-Molwa, there are thousands more Tarutaru where you came from. I'm sure I can find another to assist me!${prompt}
I seriously worry about the success of my research...${prompt};I-I'm sorry, Your Professorship! Please forgive me! It won't happen again!${prompt}

<Yawn>...${prompt};But enough of this idle chit-chat. I guess there is only one way to see if you have truly learned your lesson.${prompt}
What sort of enchantment is this?${prompt};${name-player}. Am I safe to assume that you are familiar with the quickest route to Mamo--?
Hm? Where is our little friend!?${prompt};<Yawn>...${prompt}
${name-player}! And you call yourself a bodyguard! It has been less than an hour and you have already succeeded in losing one of my team!${prompt};What sort of enchantment is this?${prompt}
Luckily it was just Salwa, but what if it had been me!?${prompt};Hm? Where is our little friend!?${prompt}
While I do not like the idea of losing precious research time...${prompt};${name-player}! And you call yourself a bodyguard! It has been less than an hour and you have already succeeded in losing one of my team!${prompt}

A toad chasing a Poroggo!;I thought I saw...

Amazing!;A Tarutaru chasing a toad!
You say you saw an actual Poroggo!?${prompt};A Tarutaru chasing a Poroggo!${prompt}
Let me see... Then we can assume the toad you saw chasing after it would be none other than Salwa-Molwa!${prompt};Amazing!
......;You say you saw an actual Poroggo!?${prompt}
How dare he go and transform without allowing me time to make my observations! If he is still expecting pay in full for this debacle, then he is gravely mistaken!${prompt};Let me see... Then we can assume the toad you saw chasing after it would be none other than Salwa-Molwa!${prompt}
!?;......

We can assume that the Tarutaru was Salwa-Molwa. However, why in the world has he chosen to run off and leave us here?${prompt};!?
Perhaps the toad placed a powerful charm spell on him... But why would it do that?${prompt};You say you witnessed a Tarutaru chasing a toad?${prompt}
No... I believe this is the scheming of a Poroggo.${prompt};We can assume that the Tarutaru was Salwa-Molwa. However, why in the world has he chosen to run off and leave us here?${prompt}
You must have simply mistaken the beastman for a common toad--an oversight easily understandable, coming from an uneducated lay${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] such as yourself.${prompt};Perhaps the toad placed a powerful charm spell on him... But why would it do that?${prompt}

We can safely assume that the Tarutaru was Salwa-Molwa. However, why in the world would he be chasing away the very beastman we seek?${prompt};What is this!?
There is also the possibility that he was put under a powerful charm spell... But if that is indeed the case, why wasn't he transformed into a toad as well...?${prompt};You say you witnessed a Tarutaru pursuing a Poroggo!?${prompt}
Either way, it seems best if we continue our expedition as planned.${prompt};We can safely assume that the Tarutaru was Salwa-Molwa. However, why in the world would he be chasing away the very beastman we seek?${prompt}

My data tells us that the Poroggo mating grounds lie in an area accessible from an entrance located on the western side of this forest.${prompt};Either way, it seems best if we continue our expedition as planned.${prompt}
Now let us make haste.${prompt};If a Poroggo truly was involved in Salwa's disappearance, then we shall find both of them in Mamook.${prompt}
<Sigh>...;My data tells us that the Poroggo mating grounds lie in an area accessible from an entrance located on the western side of this forest.${prompt}
Perhaps this encounter with the Poroggo is a blessing in disguise.${prompt};Now let us make haste.${prompt}
However, if that is the case, why did they kidnap that useless Salwa?${prompt};<Sigh>...
Hm!?;Perhaps this encounter with the Poroggo is a blessing in disguise.${prompt}
This whole situation is quite similar to that old fairy tale...${prompt};However, if that is the case, why did they kidnap that useless Salwa?${prompt}
I'm sure you have heard of it: “Poroggo and the Prince.”${prompt};Hm!?
One day, a young Tarutaru is in the forest collecting toadstools when the frog princess, Poroggo, falls in love with the poor boy and carries him away to her underwater kingdom.${prompt};This whole situation is quite similar to that old fairy tale...${prompt}
Though Salwa-Molwa is not exactly what you could call “young,” I can't imagine anyone, even an amphibian, taking a fancy in that numbskull.${prompt};I'm sure you have heard of it: “Poroggo and the Prince.”${prompt}

Now, off to Mamook!${prompt};There must be a logical explanation for what happened to Salwa.${prompt}
Pro～fe～sso～r!;It is just that we have yet to determine it.${prompt}
Hm!?;Now, off to Mamook!${prompt}
Mikilulu! She's-- I've-- It's-- We've-- Toad!${prompt};Pro～fe～sso～r!

${name-player} and I were just about to set off in search of you.${prompt};Mikilulu! She's-- I've-- It's-- We've-- Toad!${prompt}
However, it seems that you, in turn, have found us. All's well that ends well, I suppose.${prompt};Well, if it isn't Salwa-Molwa...${prompt}
Now, why don't you calm down and explain to us what has befallen you...starting with that unfortunate occurrence in Wajaom.${prompt};${name-player} and I were just about to set off in search of you.${prompt}

So it was just as you explained, ${name-player}.${prompt};I tried to catch her so you could help break the curse, but for some reason, she started hopping off in the direction of Mamook!

Anyway, I tried my best to catch my poor sweetheart, but she was just too slick and slimy.${prompt};So it was just as you explained, ${name-player}.${prompt}
And before I knew it, I found myself in the middle of the forest. Miki had stopped near a tree and I was just about to sneak up and grab her...${prompt};(You must have the eyes of a pugil, ${name-player}. His account of the events is absolutely nothing like what you claim to have seen!)${prompt}

Hmmm... An interesting story...${prompt};...when I saw her jump towards a shadow that was probably a terrible monster! It was a Poroggo, I tell you!${prompt}
Though one aspect of the tale makes little sense--what was this female acquaintance of yours doing in the Wajaom Woodlands in the first place?${prompt};And I'd bet my grandma's subligar that it was the same one that put us to sleep!
I don't know. She didn't tell me...;Hmmm... An interesting story...${prompt}
I can only guess it was because she was worried about the experiment.${prompt};Though one aspect of the tale makes little sense--what was this female acquaintance of yours doing in the Wajaom Woodlands in the first place?${prompt}

Calm down, calm down. Now, tell us what happened next.${prompt};Oh! Why did it have to be Miki!? I was the one that was supposed to be transformed!${prompt}

...and that's when I lost him...${prompt};Calm down, calm down. Now, tell us what happened next.${prompt}
I thought about searching for the frogman myself, but this place is crawling with hungry-looking Mamool Ja, and I wasn't planning on being a snack for those snakes.${prompt};Well, after what seemed like hours of chasing, the Poroggo finally ducked away into this cave...${prompt}

We are left with no other choice than to locate and rescue this Mikilulu.${prompt};I thought about searching for the frogman myself, but this place is crawling with hungry-looking Mamool Ja, and I wasn't planning on being a snack for those snakes.${prompt}
But how, Professor?${prompt};Understood.
My recent studies of Poroggo behavior have led me to the following conclusions regarding the removal of their curses.${prompt};We are left with no other choice than to locate and rescue this Mikilulu.${prompt}
The first is that the effects of the frog song will simply wear off after time.${prompt};But how, Professor?${prompt}
If we can catch your lady friend, then we need simply wait in a safe location until she returns to normal.${prompt};My recent studies of Poroggo behavior have led me to the following conclusions regarding the removal of their curses.${prompt}
The second of my conclusions is a tad more dramatic.${prompt};The first is that the effects of the frog song will simply wear off after time.${prompt}

...by slaying its caster.${prompt};The second of my conclusions is a tad more dramatic.${prompt}
While I hope it will not come to this, we may be forced to resort to violence if the Poroggo in question is not as cooperative as we may like.${prompt};In theory, the spell of the frog song can also be broken...${prompt}
Now, I am a man of science. I could never resort to killing a fellow living creature. That is where you come in, ${name-player}.${prompt};...by slaying its caster.${prompt}
Now, as for distinguishing 'your' toad from a more common specimen...${prompt};While I hope it will not come to this, we may be forced to resort to violence if the Poroggo in question is not as cooperative as we may like.${prompt}
Professor! I think I can tell which one is my Miki!${prompt};Now, I am a man of science. I could never resort to killing a fellow living creature. That is where you come in, ${name-player}.${prompt}
I mean, I did chase her through the forest for almost an hour.${prompt};Now, as for distinguishing 'your' toad from a more common specimen...${prompt}
But even so, I'd know my own fiancee anywhere--frog or not!${prompt};Professor! I think I can tell which one is my Miki!${prompt}
Hmmm...;I mean, I did chase her through the forest for almost an hour.${prompt}
While I do not question your feelings towards Mikilulu...${prompt};But even so, I'd know my own fiancee anywhere--frog or not!${prompt}
...I am wary of basing our search efforts on the memory of a Tarutaru who cannot even remember at which gate he is to convene.${prompt};Hmmm...
If only there were another, more reliable method...${prompt};While I do not question your feelings towards Mikilulu...${prompt}
And what do we have here!?;...I am wary of basing our search efforts on the memory of a Tarutaru who cannot even remember at which gate he is to convene.${prompt}
Toadprints! And quite fresh, by my calculations.${prompt};If only there were another, more reliable method...${prompt}
Salwa, my boy. Have you seen any other toads in the vicinity since arriving?${prompt};And what do we have here!?
I-- No... I haven't!${prompt};Toadprints! And quite fresh, by my calculations.${prompt}
Then by process of elimination, we can deduce that the prints here belong to none other than Mikilulu!${prompt};Salwa, my boy. Have you seen any other toads in the vicinity since arriving?${prompt}
Whoa!;I-- No... I haven't!${prompt}
I guess that's why they call you “Professor”!${prompt};Then by process of elimination, we can deduce that the prints here belong to none other than Mikilulu!${prompt}
But...;Whoa!
This place is huge. Where do we start looking?${prompt};I guess that's why they call you “Professor”!${prompt}
You need not worry, son. Poroggo are an amphibious species, meaning they cannot survive long out of water.${prompt};But...
To the west of our current location lies a small lake that is rumored to be one of their breeding grounds. We shall first try our luck there.${prompt};This place is huge. Where do we start looking?${prompt}
And if anything attempts to attack us, I am sure our trusty mercenary here will handle it.${prompt};You need not worry, son. Poroggo are an amphibious species, meaning they cannot survive long out of water.${prompt}

And exactly the same shape as the last! I feel we are getting close...${prompt};And if anything attempts to attack us, I am sure our trusty mercenary here will handle it.${prompt}
And here is another!${prompt};Another toadprint!
But this one is considerably larger... No doubt from the Poroggo that abducted the poor Mikilulu. This suggests that they are still traveling together.${prompt};And exactly the same shape as the last! I feel we are getting close...${prompt}
I found her!!!;And here is another!${prompt}
I do not see any Poroggo in the area.;But this one is considerably larger... No doubt from the Poroggo that abducted the poor Mikilulu. This suggests that they are still traveling together.${prompt}
Hurry! We must capture her while she is alone!${prompt};I found her!!!
Let me make sure her print is the same as the one at the entrance.${prompt};I do not see any Poroggo in the area.
Yes... A perfect match!${prompt};Hurry! We must capture her while she is alone!${prompt}
Yes!;Let me make sure her print is the same as the one at the entrance.${prompt}
Mikimiki! Why did you go and run away from your Salwa? You don't know how worried I was!${prompt};Yes... A perfect match!${prompt}
So, Professor. Now all we have to do is wait for the spell to wear off naturally, right?${prompt};Yes!
Correct. Though, I highly recommend we do so at a location safer than this.${prompt};Mikimiki! Why did you go and run away from your Salwa? You don't know how worried I was!${prompt}
Look out!;So, Professor. Now all we have to do is wait for the spell to wear off naturally, right?${prompt}
Ugh!;Correct. Though, I highly recommend we do so at a location safer than this.${prompt}
Hmmm... Just as I had feared.${prompt};Look out!
Wait! Come back here, you stinky, slimy frogman!;Ugh!
Stop!${prompt};Hmmm... Just as I had feared.${prompt}
Gwahhh!${prompt};Wait! Come back here, you stinky, slimy frogman!
I--I don't think I can handle this guy by myself... He's all yours, ${name-player}!;Stop!${prompt}
Save my Mikilulu!;Gwahhh!${prompt}
You did it! Now Miki will...${prompt};I--I don't think I can handle this guy by myself... He's all yours, ${name-player}!
What the...?${prompt};Save my Mikilulu!
I do not understand... The spell should have been broken the instant the caster became incapacitated.${prompt};You did it! Now Miki will...${prompt}
Does this mean...we killed the wrong one!?;What the...?${prompt}
Hmmm...;I do not understand... The spell should have been broken the instant the caster became incapacitated.${prompt}
The print is the same as the one we saw near Mikilulu's.${prompt};Does this mean...we killed the wrong one!?
I also believe I witnessed your lady friend respond to one of the Poroggo's commands during the battle.${prompt};Hmmm...
Finally, you can see that the subject has calmed down quite considerably since her captor's defeat.${prompt};The print is the same as the one we saw near Mikilulu's.${prompt}
Then if this is really Miki, and that is really the culprit, then why is she still a toad!?${prompt};I also believe I witnessed your lady friend respond to one of the Poroggo's commands during the battle.${prompt}
That, my boy, I cannot say. My data has never failed me before...${prompt};Finally, you can see that the subject has calmed down quite considerably since her captor's defeat.${prompt}
But... But...${prompt};Then if this is really Miki, and that is really the culprit, then why is she still a toad!?${prompt}
But what about waiting for the spell to wear off? You said that would work, right?${prompt};That, my boy, I cannot say. My data has never failed me before...${prompt}
Yes, and I also said that slaying the caster would break the curse...${prompt};But... But...${prompt}
Eh!?${prompt};But what about waiting for the spell to wear off? You said that would work, right?${prompt}
Let us rethink this from a scientific standpoint, shall we?${prompt};Yes, and I also said that slaying the caster would break the curse...${prompt}
First of all, it is clear that the tissue mutation is merely a physiological reaction to a particular medium that has been introduced into the victim's body via the sound waves of the frog song.${prompt};Eh!?${prompt}
This reaction continues until the whole body is affected, thus reducing him or her to the shape of the assailant.${prompt};Let us rethink this from a scientific standpoint, shall we?${prompt}
The concept is much similar to that behind the strange liquid medium that transforms its consumer into the shape of a Mamool Ja.${prompt};First of all, it is clear that the tissue mutation is merely a physiological reaction to a particular medium that has been introduced into the victim's body via the sound waves of the frog song.${prompt}
Now, whether the sound waves of the frog song actually carry the medium...${prompt};This reaction continues until the whole body is affected, thus reducing him or her to the shape of the assailant.${prompt}
...or simply act as a catalyst, activating a genetic medium already present in the victim's body, I cannot say.${prompt};The concept is much similar to that behind the strange liquid medium that transforms its consumer into the shape of a Mamool Ja.${prompt}
That was to be the focal point of this expedition's research.${prompt};Now, whether the sound waves of the frog song actually carry the medium...${prompt}
As for the victim's actions while in the transmogrified state, it seems that one loses the ability of voluntary thought, leaving him susceptible to the will of the caster.${prompt};...or simply act as a catalyst, activating a genetic medium already present in the victim's body, I cannot say.${prompt}
We can derive from this that the Poroggo must be sending some type of neural signal directly to the victim's brain.${prompt};That was to be the focal point of this expedition's research.${prompt}
I believe this signal may also affect the medium I spoke of earlier.${prompt};As for the victim's actions while in the transmogrified state, it seems that one loses the ability of voluntary thought, leaving him susceptible to the will of the caster.${prompt}
By taking control of the nervous system, the Poroggo is able to override the victim's natural defenses--in particular, the defenses that prevent foreign mediums from invading the body.${prompt};We can derive from this that the Poroggo must be sending some type of neural signal directly to the victim's brain.${prompt}
The signal also may trigger the spontaneous generation of a new medium in the body by stimulating certain areas of the cerebral cortex.${prompt};I believe this signal may also affect the medium I spoke of earlier.${prompt}
To put it in layman's terms...${prompt};By taking control of the nervous system, the Poroggo is able to override the victim's natural defenses--in particular, the defenses that prevent foreign mediums from invading the body.${prompt}
To maintain the transmogrified state, there must exist a continuous physiological reaction.${prompt};The signal also may trigger the spontaneous generation of a new medium in the body by stimulating certain areas of the cerebral cortex.${prompt}
In other words, the Poroggo must keep sending inhibitor signals to the victim, or the reaction will cease.${prompt};To put it in layman's terms...${prompt}
In theory, maintaining these signals would require extreme levels of concentration. This explains why most victims return to their original state after extended periods of time--when the caster becomes fatigued or distracted.${prompt};To maintain the transmogrified state, there must exist a continuous physiological reaction.${prompt}
And if we apply these same conclusions, then we can easily explain why defeating the caster would immediately nullify the effects of the song.${prompt};In other words, the Poroggo must keep sending inhibitor signals to the victim, or the reaction will cease.${prompt}
However, as we can see here, the victim, Mikilulu, remains in the transmogrified state despite the fact her assailant has met his demise.${prompt};In theory, maintaining these signals would require extreme levels of concentration. This explains why most victims return to their original state after extended periods of time--when the caster becomes fatigued or distracted.${prompt}
Which suggests that she may not return with the simple passing of time.${prompt};And if we apply these same conclusions, then we can easily explain why defeating the caster would immediately nullify the effects of the song.${prompt}
Wh-what!? That can't be!${prompt};However, as we can see here, the victim, Mikilulu, remains in the transmogrified state despite the fact her assailant has met his demise.${prompt}
The potency of the physiological reaction has been known to vary depending on mental condition of the victim. It is possible the song resonated with something deep within Mikilulu's subconscious.${prompt};Which suggests that she may not return with the simple passing of time.${prompt}
Wait a minute... Are you trying to say that my girl has always been a frog!?${prompt};Wh-what!? That can't be!${prompt}
While I wouldn't necessarily use those words, yes, one could say that your Mikilulu has more than likely been harboring suppressed ranine tendencies.${prompt};The potency of the physiological reaction has been known to vary depending on mental condition of the victim. It is possible the song resonated with something deep within Mikilulu's subconscious.${prompt}
Though, there may be a more reasonable explanation.${prompt};Wait a minute... Are you trying to say that my girl has always been a frog!?${prompt}
For example, if a large portion of Mikilulu's conscious had been dedicated to thinking of, and or, worrying about toads, then her mind may have become dependant on the Poroggo's signal and thus began reproducing it out of necessity when the original signal stopped.${prompt};While I wouldn't necessarily use those words, yes, one could say that your Mikilulu has more than likely been harboring suppressed ranine tendencies.${prompt}
Eh!?${prompt};Though, there may be a more reasonable explanation.${prompt}

P-Professor! Let me help you!${prompt};But you need not fear, my friend, for I shall dedicate myself to finding a solution to this predicament.${prompt}
I'll do anything!;You have my word as a scientist!${prompt}
I mean, I don't know much about zoology, but there's got to be something I can do!${prompt};P-Professor! Let me help you!${prompt}
Hmmm...;I'll do anything!
I conduct a very strict program. I require the utmost in discipline from my assistants.${prompt};I mean, I don't know much about zoology, but there's got to be something I can do!${prompt}

Ah, and if I do recall, you have a slight problem with punctuality.${prompt};T-Thanks B! I...uh, mean, thank you very much, Your Professing Greatness.${prompt}

Oh, and I bet you'll be wanting to take a swim every now and then.${prompt};N-none at all, sir!${prompt}

And food! I'll get you whatever you're craving for! What are you craving for? Worms? No, wait moles like worms... What do toads like again? Bugs! That's right!${prompt};Oh, and I bet you'll be wanting to take a swim every now and then.${prompt}
If it's bugs you want, bugs you'll get! I've got a Mog Locker full of shell bugs from that last time I tried to grow some ore.${prompt};Well, you don't have to worry about that. Just croak and I'll dig you your very own swamp, with lily pads and everything!${prompt}
...${prompt};And food! I'll get you whatever you're craving for! What are you craving for? Worms? No, wait moles like worms... What do toads like again? Bugs! That's right!${prompt}

M-Mikilulu!${prompt};And then...${prompt}
Amazing!${prompt};We can get married and live happily ever after!${prompt}
That's all I wanted to hear, Salwa.${prompt};M-Mikilulu!${prompt}
You... You understood what I was saying the whole time?${prompt};Amazing!${prompt}
No, not the whole time.${prompt};That's all I wanted to hear, Salwa.${prompt}
But for some reason, those last few words of yours rang out in my head...${prompt};You... You understood what I was saying the whole time?${prompt}
...and before I knew it, I was back to my old self!${prompt};No, not the whole time.${prompt}
Wow... So, all this time you were a frog, you were still thinking of me?${prompt};But for some reason, those last few words of yours rang out in my head...${prompt}
I'm sorry, Mikilulu. This is all my fault. If I hadn't made you worry about me being transmutrified into a toad, you wouldn't have had to go through all this.${prompt};...and before I knew it, I was back to my old self!${prompt}
But never again! From now on, I'll protect you from anything that stands in the way of our love...${prompt};Wow... So, all this time you were a frog, you were still thinking of me?${prompt}
Salwa...${prompt};I'm sorry, Mikilulu. This is all my fault. If I hadn't made you worry about me being transmutrified into a toad, you wouldn't have had to go through all this.${prompt}
...as soon as I finish this job for Professor Clavauert!${prompt};But never again! From now on, I'll protect you from anything that stands in the way of our love...${prompt}
Your services are no longer required, Salwa-Molwa.${prompt};Salwa...${prompt}
Eh? You're not going through with the experiment? But what about your research? What about my paycheck!?${prompt};...as soon as I finish this job for Professor Clavauert!${prompt}
What are you talking about? The experiment was a success.${prompt};Your services are no longer required, Salwa-Molwa.${prompt}
Let me sum up my theory for you.${prompt};Eh? You're not going through with the experiment? But what about your research? What about my paycheck!?${prompt}
Your expression of love triggered something within Mikilulu's mind, or should I say heart, thus releasing her from the grasp of the inhibitor signals.${prompt};What are you talking about? The experiment was a success.${prompt}
This ultimately proves that the duration of the frog song depends less on the potency of the Poroggo's cant, and more on the victim's psychological state.${prompt};Let me sum up my theory for you.${prompt}
And because we now know that the victim's mind is capable of mimicking the Poroggo inhibitor signal...${prompt};Your expression of love triggered something within Mikilulu's mind, or should I say heart, thus releasing her from the grasp of the inhibitor signals.${prompt}

...that the true culprit behind physical transmogrification is the victim himself!${prompt};Therefore, I shall reconstruct my original theories and continue my research to discover a connection between Poroggo neural activity and transmogrification duration.${prompt}
If this seemingly subconscious action could somehow be made lucid, then people could transform themselves into whatever shape they dreamed!${prompt};This expedition has spawned more questions than it has answered, but I did learn one thing...${prompt}
However, this hypothesis requires much more research before it can be proven. I have much work ahead of me...${prompt};...that the true culprit behind physical transmogrification is the victim himself!${prompt}

Of course it does. And I shall even throw in something extra for Mikilulu's part in all this. Come by my office tomorrow morning at nine o-clock sharp...and do not be late!${prompt};And... Um... So does this mean I still get my paycheck...?${prompt}
