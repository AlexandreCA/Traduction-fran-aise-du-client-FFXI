How positively odd. According to the map, this should be the right direction...${prompt};Be this the person whom you've recruited to assist us?${prompt}
I've gotten us lost, you say!? Well, I never!${prompt};Affirmative. The aid ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] has volunteered shall prove pivotal to the strategy.${prompt}

Hmph! If it would put finis to your grumbling, please be my guest and lead the way!${prompt};My name is Pignoit, and I have the honor of serving under Chief Engineer Bostillette.${prompt}

The encampment is a short ways northeast of the entrance to the La Theine Plateau! Mind you don't get us lost!${prompt};Sir. But moments ago word arrived from our Ghelsba-based operative.${prompt}
Ah! We've arrived, ${name-player}!${prompt};Fangmonger Zogbog has resurfaced at the Orcish stronghold.${prompt}
Hallooo!;So, after an extended absence, the infamous military tactician-turned-research exponent finally makes his return...
Chief Bostillette!;But we, the Iron Ram Engineers, shall be as a spanner thrown into the works of Zogbog's dastardly plans.
Eagerly have we awaited your return.${prompt};Allow me to explain the situation, ${name-player}. Some time ago, it came to light that the Orcs were conducting arcane research on powerful magic statues for use in warfare in the deepest interior of Fort Ghelsba.${prompt}
Be this the person whom you've recruited to assist us?${prompt};These constructs have been in development behind closed doors for the past two decades, and our intelligence operatives have brought alarming reports that their unveiling is nigh.${prompt}
Affirmative. The aid ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] has volunteered shall prove pivotal to the strategy.${prompt};There is no telling the destructive potential of the statues, but this much is certain: they must not be given the chance to wreak havoc upon the Kingdom.${prompt}
Well met, good ${choice-player-gender}[sir/lady].;Masterminding the development is Zogbog, whom we believe seeks to exact revenge for the Orcish defeat in the Crystal War.${prompt}
My name is Pignoit, and I have the honor of serving under Chief Engineer Bostillette.${prompt};With the Royal Knight General's endorsement, we've devised a covert strategy to infiltrate the enemy's lair and destroy the statues before they can be used against us.${prompt}
Likewise for I, Fransont. Jolly good to have you on board!${prompt};The gravity of our mission is such that numerous safeguards have been employed to ensure the Orcs are kept ignorant of our plan.${prompt}
Sir. But moments ago word arrived from our Ghelsba-based operative.${prompt};Even so, Chief, I fail to see the need for all involved to call each other by code names.${prompt}
Fangmonger Zogbog has resurfaced at the Orcish stronghold.${prompt};Thus far it has proven to be a right royal pain when communicating with fellow strategy members.${prompt}
So, after an extended absence, the infamous military tactician-turned-research exponent finally makes his return...;A valid concern, soldier. If you find not unpleasant the idea of joining the hapless souls who met with foul play during the Great War, then by all means wear your identity on your sleeve.${prompt}
But we, the Iron Ram Engineers, shall be as a spanner thrown into the works of Zogbog's dastardly plans.;<Gulp> R-remarkably well put, sir. Mayhap a little inconvenience would not kill me after all...literally.${prompt}
Allow me to explain the situation, ${name-player}. Some time ago, it came to light that the Orcs were conducting arcane research on powerful magic statues for use in warfare in the deepest interior of Fort Ghelsba.${prompt};Hehehe, it gladdens me to see that you understand.
These constructs have been in development behind closed doors for the past two decades, and our intelligence operatives have brought alarming reports that their unveiling is nigh.${prompt};Now then, the hour of reckoning draws nigh.${prompt}
There is no telling the destructive potential of the statues, but this much is certain: they must not be given the chance to wreak havoc upon the Kingdom.${prompt};Has the commander not yet arrived?${prompt}
Masterminding the development is Zogbog, whom we believe seeks to exact revenge for the Orcish defeat in the Crystal War.${prompt};If you seek Commander Excen--I mean, Maxcimille, he was seen striking for Ghelsba with a young lad in tow.${prompt}
With the Royal Knight General's endorsement, we've devised a covert strategy to infiltrate the enemy's lair and destroy the statues before they can be used against us.${prompt};Far be it from me to spread gossip, but I never imagined the commander had the time to rear a child, let alone take a woman to wife.${prompt}
The gravity of our mission is such that numerous safeguards have been employed to ensure the Orcs are kept ignorant of our plan.${prompt};Ah, yes. Hefting matching swords and wearing identical frowns, they were indeed a heartwarming sight to behold!${prompt}
Even so, Chief, I fail to see the need for all involved to call each other by code names.${prompt};Ohohoho. Verily, there is far more to our fearless leader than meets the eye.${prompt}
Thus far it has proven to be a right royal pain when communicating with fellow strategy members.${prompt};Now, without further ado, ${name-player}, pray make for Ghelsba and rejoin the commander and his young companion.${prompt}

I've been waiting for you, ${name-player}.${prompt};But no more, for it was reft of its glorious vistas the day the sky turned crimson and hordes of abominations flooded the land.${prompt}
Much have I heard of you from Joachim.${prompt};There is one thing I find puzzling, ${name-player}.
Moniquaurie is my name, and I, too, am a native of Abyssea.${prompt};You've seen with your own eyes the sickly state of Abyssea, yet you insist on going there. What is it that drives you?${prompt}
There exist two cavernous maws here in the Jugner Forest, although you may have noted a difference.${prompt};Whatever your answer is, keep it to yourself.
It intrigues me as to what has caused the one to be turned to stone.;It matters not whether your reason for setting foot in my home world be materialistic or altruistic.${prompt}
However, I haven't the luxury of time to be sating my own curiosities.${prompt};But enough pleasantries. I've come here for no other reason than to brief you on the current situation in Vunkerl, and brief you I shall.${prompt}
The two of us have matters of far graver import to discuss.${prompt};The resistance effort in the inlet is built around early model martellos whose functions are augmented via a central unit, the pulse martello. An outpost was secretly established especially for the purpose of housing the latter.${prompt}
Firstly, you would do well to know that this maw is connected not to the Jugner Forest of Abyssea, but instead, the Vunkerl Inlet.${prompt};Of late, however, the Abyssean hordes have taken to attacking the outpost with unnerving singleness of mind.
Some have theorized that a dimensional misalignment has caused this, but you needn't rack your mind with academic ponderings.${prompt};We can only conclude that the enemy have somehow learned of its strategic importance.${prompt}
Are you familiar with the inlet? It is a place of beauty both wondrous and serene.${prompt};Our defenses have held up thus far, but cannot indefinitely repel such a determined enemy offensive.
But no more, for it was reft of its glorious vistas the day the sky turned crimson and hordes of abominations flooded the land.${prompt};And to compound matters, Vunkerl's terrain places us at a distinct disadvantage against besiegers.${prompt}
There is one thing I find puzzling, ${name-player}.;Unless more people aid in the outpost's defense, the resistance effort in Vunkerl will surely end in failure.
You've seen with your own eyes the sickly state of Abyssea, yet you insist on going there. What is it that drives you?${prompt};I myself would've long since leapt into the fray, but I share the same fate as Joachim and can no longer return home...${prompt}

Of late, however, the Abyssean hordes have taken to attacking the outpost with unnerving singleness of mind.;Truly? You have my thanks, ${name-player}.
We can only conclude that the enemy have somehow learned of its strategic importance.${prompt};Joachim's trust in you is well-founded, it'd seem.${prompt}
Our defenses have held up thus far, but cannot indefinitely repel such a determined enemy offensive.;Before you cross over to Abyssea, however, there is one piece of knowledge you should take with you.${prompt}
And to compound matters, Vunkerl's terrain places us at a distinct disadvantage against besiegers.${prompt};There is a fell creature that has been terrorizing Vunkerl, a gargantuan beast identified as a ruszor.
Unless more people aid in the outpost's defense, the resistance effort in Vunkerl will surely end in failure.;Countless soldiers and civilians alike have fallen prey to its dreadful tusks.${prompt}
I myself would've long since leapt into the fray, but I share the same fate as Joachim and can no longer return home...${prompt};I had heard that ruszors once thrived in great numbers in the Northlands, but were hunted to extinction soon after the Great War.${prompt}
What will you say?;How is it possible, then, that such a terrible specimen has survived to this day to now prowl the inlet, where none had been seen before?
${selection-lines};Could the destabilizing boundary between worlds spoken of by that Tarutaru be the culprit behind such inexplicable occurrences?${prompt}
You just leave Vunkerl to me!;When that oddball member of the Resistance put forth this theory, we all mocked him for a fool...but now I wonder.
I can help...I guess?${prompt};Regardless, I counsel you to avoid engaging that creature--the ruszor--until such time as you've acclimatized to Vunkerl's environs.${prompt}

Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized.;When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.
This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.${prompt};These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt}
Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed “Voidwatch Operations,” or “Ops” for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.${prompt};Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt}
A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time “Voidwatcher” status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.${prompt};The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt}
Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.${prompt};Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.
Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world.;Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt}
Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.${prompt};As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt}
Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.${prompt};Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt}
Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.${prompt};Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt}
However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.${prompt};After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt}
When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it.;Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt}
These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.${prompt};Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt}
Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.${prompt};While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt}
The “voidstone” is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.${prompt};Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt}
Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation.;Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt}
Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.${prompt};Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt}
As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.${prompt};Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt}
Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.${prompt};Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt}
Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.${prompt};The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt}
After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.${prompt};The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt}
Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.${prompt};Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt}
Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.${prompt};Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt}
While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt};Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts.
Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items.”${prompt};By infusing atmacite to one's body using ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.${prompt}
Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.${prompt};Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt}
Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.${prompt};Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.${prompt}
Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.${prompt};Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.${prompt}
Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.${prompt};As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.${prompt}
The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.${prompt};Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.${prompt}
The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.${prompt};Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level ${number: 0}.${prompt}
Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.${prompt};All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.${prompt}
Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.${prompt};Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt}
Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts.;Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.${prompt}

How about I let you in on some trade secrets?;Therefore, as you may have inferred, pulse panoplia are the visual structures yielded by such procedures. I use the phrase “visual structures” here because these pulses do not technically possess a singular, concrete form.${prompt}
All I ask is that you refrain from sharing them with every Tomasa, Dixon, and Harith.${prompt};The details of these pulses are highly classified, and I am not at liberty to make them privy to the rank and file.
What will you do?;While you may not have access to all the particulars on them, you will surely encounter these particle aggregates on the field of battle.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Much like the legendary swords of the Far East, it is not the adventurer who chooses the pulse panoplia, but the pulse that chooses to initiate an exclusive bond with its owner.

Pulse Panoplia is the term our researchers have bestowed upon a specific set of equipment that emits an entrancing luminescence, such as ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};...But I digress.${prompt}
Our brightest minds in the experimental field of Opticogradiology have succeeded in stabilizing the particles that constitute the source of this enigmatic light, a phenomenon which is often referred to as a “pulse.”${prompt};If pulses disperse when handed to a new owner, then it follows that all one need do is regather the particles and restabilize them.
Therefore, as you may have inferred, pulse panoplia are the visual structures yielded by such procedures. I use the phrase “visual structures” here because these pulses do not technically possess a singular, concrete form.${prompt};The reasoning involved is quite elementary, my dear ${name-player}.${prompt}
The details of these pulses are highly classified, and I am not at liberty to make them privy to the rank and file.;“How does one go about procuring these pulse particles,” you ask?
While you may not have access to all the particulars on them, you will surely encounter these particle aggregates on the field of battle.${prompt};An astute question for someone of such a brutish vocation. I could lecture for hours concerning this unfathomably deep topic...but I won't.${prompt}
Much like the legendary swords of the Far East, it is not the adventurer who chooses the pulse panoplia, but the pulse that chooses to initiate an exclusive bond with its owner.;For brevity's sake, I shall cite only the most basic facts that delineate their connection to Voidwatchers.${prompt}
In the past, if one tried to bequeath such equipment to a comrade...${prompt};It is well documented that pulses exhibit a certain response in the presence of stratum abyssite.
The pulse would dissolve in an instant, leaving the recipient with naught but a feeling of dissatisfaction.${prompt};Thus, it stands to reason that anyone in possession of said abyssite would collect pulse particles in the form of pulse cells.${prompt}
However, our passionate scientists have finally uncovered a method by which to permanently regulate the activity of these pulses.;Sadly, that is neither the final nor most difficult step here. Reconstruction is the most integral aspect of the process.${prompt}
"They worked day-in and day-out, and their lives suffered as a consequence; they forgot their families, friends, and all other obligations.${prompt}";Our studies have shown that pulse particles lose a vast amount of their energy as heat and other byproducts of dispersion, meaning it is empirically impossible to restore a pulse to its former level of effectiveness.${prompt}
...But I digress.${prompt};By the by, I may have promised a brief explanation, but those are hard to come by when such vast stores of knowledge are involved.
If pulses disperse when handed to a new owner, then it follows that all one need do is regather the particles and restabilize them.;Returning to the matter at hand...${prompt}
The reasoning involved is quite elementary, my dear ${name-player}.${prompt};The essence of what I'm trying to convey is that a one-to-one ratio of pre- to post-dispersion pulses is simply not viable.${prompt}
“How does one go about procuring these pulse particles,” you ask?;Notice how I qualified “ratio” with “one-to-one.” While individual pulses may lack potency, it is possible to augment that dearth with additional pulses.${prompt}
An astute question for someone of such a brutish vocation. I could lecture for hours concerning this unfathomably deep topic...but I won't.${prompt};The latest double-blind, peer-reviewed experiment conducted at our research center determined that at least ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[post-dispersion pulse is/post-dispersion pulses are] needed to replicate the power of an original one.${prompt}
For brevity's sake, I shall cite only the most basic facts that delineate their connection to Voidwatchers.${prompt};"As a corollary, though, I must add that one cannot go around collecting any old cells and expect to recreate a masterpiece as delicate as a pulse; the pulse cells you acquire must all be of the same ilk.${prompt}"
It is well documented that pulses exhibit a certain response in the presence of stratum abyssite.;Once you obtain ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[pulse cell/pulse cells], all you have to do is relinquish them to me. I shall do my utmost to reconstruct the pulse panoplia of my--<ahem> your dreams.${prompt}
Thus, it stands to reason that anyone in possession of said abyssite would collect pulse particles in the form of pulse cells.${prompt};That is, if you possess the necessary faculties for a pulse to initiate a bond with you.
Sadly, that is neither the final nor most difficult step here. Reconstruction is the most integral aspect of the process.${prompt};Hopefully my explanation didn't fly too high over that microscopic brain of yours, although I never tire of conversing on this subject.${prompt}
Our studies have shown that pulse particles lose a vast amount of their energy as heat and other byproducts of dispersion, meaning it is empirically impossible to restore a pulse to its former level of effectiveness.${prompt};You truly want to know about our latest innovation?

Returning to the matter at hand...${prompt};Perhaps it would be wrong to place an inordinate amount of blame on you, though, seeing as these fiends hail from another dimension.${prompt}
The essence of what I'm trying to convey is that a one-to-one ratio of pre- to post-dispersion pulses is simply not viable.${prompt};As you probably don't recall, there are five distinct chronospatial shifts that factor into Voidwalker combat that we term “phases.”
Notice how I qualified “ratio” with “one-to-one.” While individual pulses may lack potency, it is possible to augment that dearth with additional pulses.${prompt};If we are to defeat these extra-planar perambulators, we must utilize the full spectrum of these rifts by--${prompt}

Once you obtain ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[pulse cell/pulse cells], all you have to do is relinquish them to me. I shall do my utmost to reconstruct the pulse panoplia of my--<ahem> your dreams.${prompt};All I'll say on this topic is that alignment is analogous to a cross-dimensional bridge.${prompt}
That is, if you possess the necessary faculties for a pulse to initiate a bond with you.;What a fitting analogy, if I do say so myself.
Hopefully my explanation didn't fly too high over that microscopic brain of yours, although I never tire of conversing on this subject.${prompt};These monstrosities start out as massive crevasses separating you and your contingent from the sweet nectar of victory, but once the bridge is completed, the path to victory is vastly more accessible.${prompt}

All I'll say on this topic is that alignment is analogous to a cross-dimensional bridge.${prompt};Keep in mind, however, you must manually catalyze any alignment shifts you wish to exploit.${prompt}
