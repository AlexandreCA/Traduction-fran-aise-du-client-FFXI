His goal was to gain autocratic rule over the Yagudo masses.;Many Yagudo gave their lives in order to stop the monster due to hatch from the World Eater Egg.
He went on to become the Yagudo's first living deity, Ree Habalo.;The fledgling beast known as Nesnas managed to continually revive itself, despite being put down numerous times on the day...
He argued that a truly strong nation is one based in faith, and set out to reinvent the entire belief system and history of the Yagudo race.;Eventually, when the beast was brought down for the last time, only twelve brave Yagudo warriors were left standing.
However, another of the twelve heroes and founder of the Far East, Sii Clarao the Flash, questioned the intent of Ree Habalo's actions.${prompt};As such, they came to be revered by the Yagudo.
Ree Habalo went so far as to suggest that the deaths of their many comrades at the Incident at Sauromugue had been due to this concept of faith, or perhaps a lack of it.;Eventually, one of the warriors took advantage of the devotion and referred to himself as their god.
In response, Sii Clarao of the Far East declared that he also died in Sauromugue, and that he was resigned to his fate.;His goal was to gain autocratic rule over the Yagudo masses.
Thus, Sii Clarao set out on a journey of mourning with a group of like-minded supporters, sailing into the rough seas ahead before them.;He went on to become the Yagudo's first living deity, Ree Habalo.
Hmm... I have never heard this part of the tale before.${prompt};He argued that a truly strong nation is one based in faith, and set out to reinvent the entire belief system and history of the Yagudo race.
I learned that Sii Clarao was the first archpriest of the Tengu and that his views on death came about from the Incident at Sauromugue, but...${prompt};However, another of the twelve heroes and founder of the Far East, Sii Clarao the Flash, questioned the intent of Ree Habalo's actions.${prompt}
That was by design. One can only imagine the amount of blood that was spilled as a result of all that transpired.${prompt};Ree Habalo went so far as to suggest that the deaths of their many comrades at the Incident at Sauromugue had been due to this concept of faith, or perhaps a lack of it.
Yet even more concerning was that at the time, the Yagudo were eager to retake the continent of Mindartia.${prompt};In response, Sii Clarao of the Far East declared that he also died in Sauromugue, and that he was resigned to his fate.
However, if Nesnas were to reemerge within the Far East now, nothing really matters anymore...${prompt};Thus, Sii Clarao set out on a journey of mourning with a group of like-minded supporters, sailing into the rough seas ahead before them.
The Far East includes both lords and commoners alike, as well as a variety of different races.;Hmm... I have never heard this part of the tale before.${prompt}
You are worried now, even with the region's various apparitions, spirits, and gods united as one?${prompt};I learned that Sii Clarao was the first archpriest of the Tengu and that his views on death came about from the Incident at Sauromugue, but...${prompt}
That is why Master Kokai, leader of the Tengu sect, decided to form an alliance with the Middle Lands Theomilitary.${prompt};That was by design. One can only imagine the amount of blood that was spilled as a result of all that transpired.${prompt}
To be honest, the Theomilitary laughed at the idea of an alliance and stated that it would not even consider the possibility.${prompt};Yet even more concerning was that at the time, the Yagudo were eager to retake the continent of Mindartia.${prompt}
Naturally, it is safe to say things have gotten off to a rather inauspicious start.${prompt};However, if Nesnas were to reemerge within the Far East now, nothing really matters anymore...${prompt}
However, just recently, the obstinate stance of the leader, Tzee Xicu the Manifest, has begun to soften.${prompt};The Far East includes both lords and commoners alike, as well as a variety of different races.
That is likely due to receiving word of the trouble the Orcs had when they attempted to use the World Eater Egg for their own ends.${prompt};You are worried now, even with the region's various apparitions, spirits, and gods united as one?${prompt}
Or perhaps it is because of the rumors that the dead are appearing across the land. Some say that it is somehow related to the World Eater Egg...${prompt};That is why Master Kokai, leader of the Tengu sect, decided to form an alliance with the Middle Lands Theomilitary.${prompt}
Whatever the case, I believe I have a grasp on the current situation now. According to the archpriest's letter, there is a mission you wish to ask of me?${prompt};To be honest, the Theomilitary laughed at the idea of an alliance and stated that it would not even consider the possibility.${prompt}
Yes, that is correct. Tzee Xicu the Manifest wishes to procure powerful weaponry so that the alliance with the Tengu sect is on equal footing.${prompt};Naturally, it is safe to say things have gotten off to a rather inauspicious start.${prompt}
At the top of that list is the black sword that the Goblin clad in black armor wears at its side.${prompt};However, just recently, the obstinate stance of the leader, Tzee Xicu the Manifest, has begun to soften.${prompt}
Rumor has it that only a Goblin with the black sword can break open the World Eater Egg...${prompt};That is likely due to receiving word of the trouble the Orcs had when they attempted to use the World Eater Egg for their own ends.${prompt}
Tzee Xicu has stated that a Goblin is not fit to wield such a blade--it is a weapon meant for a god.${prompt};Or perhaps it is because of the rumors that the dead are appearing across the land. Some say that it is somehow related to the World Eater Egg...${prompt}
So in other words, you wish for me to seek them out and steal this black sword?${prompt};Whatever the case, I believe I have a grasp on the current situation now. According to the archpriest's letter, there is a mission you wish to ask of me?${prompt}
No, spies have been dispatched throughout the land in search of it, but after being seen in Aht Urhgan, it simply vanished without a trace.${prompt};Yes, that is correct. Tzee Xicu the Manifest wishes to procure powerful weaponry so that the alliance with the Tengu sect is on equal footing.${prompt}
Therefore, the archpriest has asked us to seek the cooperation of the Goblins living here in Reisenjima instead.${prompt};At the top of that list is the black sword that the Goblin clad in black armor wears at its side.${prompt}
As fellow residents of the Far East, they share the same fears as we all.;Rumor has it that only a Goblin with the black sword can break open the World Eater Egg...${prompt}
If we approach them in a kindly manner, they will surely agree to help us.${prompt};Tzee Xicu has stated that a Goblin is not fit to wield such a blade--it is a weapon meant for a god.${prompt}

So only a chosen few know the details?;No, spies have been dispatched throughout the land in search of it, but after being seen in Aht Urhgan, it simply vanished without a trace.${prompt}

So he may have cast an enchantment on you...${prompt};The smoothskin is extremely powerful. He easily brushed aside me and all of my fellow warriors...${prompt}
There is not much that can be done about that. However, as far as I can tell, this all came about due to your own weakness.;What!? Who is this smoothskin you speak of?${prompt}
The Tengu sect will not ignore that fact either.${prompt};Kyah... Well, I know for certain he was a Tarutaru black mage.${prompt}
Uuugh...${prompt};However, I cannot seem to recall his name, kyah.

If we were to do so, it would seriously jeopardize the talks regarding our potential alliance with them.${prompt};Go and accept your punishment with honor.${prompt}
Precisely. This is an extremely important time for both parties, who have been at odds for hundreds of years now.${prompt};Quawk! Please, I beg of you!

What do you think?${prompt};Huh!? What's wrong with you!?${prompt}

I see. It would seem you've heard from Incantrix about the story that the Yagudo had long forgotten.${prompt};I feel that I've gotten stronger, but...${prompt}
I's had no choice. I's explained how five thousand years ago, everyone fought together as one.${prompt};I believe the reason I performed better than expected was because I was competing against ${name-player}.${prompt}

I am disappointed in you, ${name-player}.${prompt};So what's happenin' now?${prompt}
No, I suppose I only have myself to blame.;You lost the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}!${prompt}

Even still, I never thought you would take in the coward Nii Aquu and agree to serve as his mentor.${prompt};Zhuu Buxu...
I witnessed his renewed fighting spirit firsthand when Gessho brought him before me.;What a farce.${prompt}
I will admit that I was impressed with how much he had grown.${prompt};I am disappointed in you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
However, I also realized that I should have made myself clearer to you.${prompt};No, I suppose I only have myself to blame.
No matter how strong he becomes, he will never be allowed to join us.${prompt};Perhaps I placed too much trust in your abilities.${prompt}
The Tengu sect is at a critical moment in its existence, so it is imperative that we form the alliance with the Theomilitary in the Middle Lands!${prompt};Even still, I never thought you would take in the coward Nii Aquu and agree to serve as his mentor.${prompt}
As such, how can we risk harboring a known fugitive from their side when even the slightest misstep could cause them to call the whole thing off?${prompt};I witnessed his renewed fighting spirit firsthand when Gessho brought him before me.
Not only would it be a bad look for us, the fact that we did not even discuss it with them first could renew hostilities between the two sides.${prompt};I will admit that I was impressed with how much he had grown.${prompt}
That would go against everything we are currently trying to accomplish.;However, I also realized that I should have made myself clearer to you.${prompt}
Furthermore, it goes against the will of Lord Kokai, the leader of the Tengu sect.${prompt};No matter how strong he becomes, he will never be allowed to join us.${prompt}

Which brings me to the subject of Gessho...${prompt};As such, how can we risk harboring a known fugitive from their side when even the slightest misstep could cause them to call the whole thing off?${prompt}
Even at this critical juncture, he shamelessly states that we should search for a proper path forward regarding the situation in order to honor the will of the Mikado and the archpriest.${prompt};Not only would it be a bad look for us, the fact that we did not even discuss it with them first could renew hostilities between the two sides.${prompt}
Naturally, we should do what is right, but I keep telling him that we cannot welcome such a traitor into our midst.;That would go against everything we are currently trying to accomplish.
I feel as if we are simply going in circles here.${prompt};Furthermore, it goes against the will of Lord Kokai, the leader of the Tengu sect.${prompt}
Of course, this is all a result of your actions, ${name-player}.${prompt};That is why we must send Nii Aquu back to the Middle Lands, and if we are lucky, they will feel some sense of obligation toward us!${prompt}
As such, I would like to demand that you take responsibility for your role in this quagmire and pay the ultimate price...${prompt};Which brings me to the subject of Gessho...${prompt}
However, I cannot overlook the fact that you managed to secure the assistance of the Goblin known as Incantrix.${prompt};Even at this critical juncture, he shamelessly states that we should search for a proper path forward regarding the situation in order to honor the will of the Mikado and the archpriest.${prompt}
The tale of Chaos, the black sword, and the Goblin hero that took place five thousand years ago...;Naturally, we should do what is right, but I keep telling him that we cannot welcome such a traitor into our midst.

Kyah-kyah!;How do you respond?
What's this? Did I hear you say that you've finally found Nii Aquu?${prompt};${selection-lines}
Ah, Master Zhuu Buxu the Silent.;That's so cruel!
I have been eagerly awaiting your arrival.${prompt};Forgive me!
At first, I thought the Tengu sect was secretly harboring the traitor, but it appears I was mistaken.${prompt};Popopi!${prompt}
Those filthy Goblins are up to something, aren't they!${prompt};Kyah-kyah!
Someone believed to be Nii Aquu was seen sucked into a glowing vortex in eastern Reisenjima.${prompt};What's this? Did I hear you say that you've finally found Nii Aquu?${prompt}
That sounds rather mysterious...;Ah, Master Zhuu Buxu the Silent.
Yes, indeed. I doubt anyone would have expected him to hide in such an unusual location.${prompt};I have been eagerly awaiting your arrival.${prompt}
However, it appears he has now returned and is somewhere near the waterfall.;At first, I thought the Tengu sect was secretly harboring the traitor, but it appears I was mistaken.${prompt}
Perhaps he goes there to meditate like Gessho does.${prompt};Those filthy Goblins are up to something, aren't they!${prompt}
...${prompt};Someone believed to be Nii Aquu was seen sucked into a glowing vortex in eastern Reisenjima.${prompt}
No matter. I shall go there and see that he faces justice.;That sounds rather mysterious...
Quawk-quawk!${prompt};Yes, indeed. I doubt anyone would have expected him to hide in such an unusual location.${prompt}
If Master Zhuu Buxu can take the traitor back to the Middle Lands with him, then all of our problems will be solved...${prompt};However, it appears he has now returned and is somewhere near the waterfall.
Now, the only thing left is how to deal with Gessho.;Perhaps he goes there to meditate like Gessho does.${prompt}
Unfortunately, that is one matter that will not resolve itself.${prompt};...${prompt}
Master Zhuu Buxu left for the waterfall in the northwest.;No matter. I shall go there and see that he faces justice.
Now, if he can just find that traitor and take him back to the Middle Lands...${prompt};Quawk-quawk!${prompt}
What are you still doing here!?;If Master Zhuu Buxu can take the traitor back to the Middle Lands with him, then all of our problems will be solved...${prompt}
I ordered you to leave the Far East and never return!${prompt};Now, the only thing left is how to deal with Gessho.
Kyah... Master, it seems that the path toward joining the Tengu sect is no longer available to me.${prompt};Unfortunately, that is one matter that will not resolve itself.${prompt}
It pains me to say it, but I was foolish to think my plan could ever succeed, quawk...${prompt};Master Zhuu Buxu left for the waterfall in the northwest.
Little did I know, everyone has already been preparing for the day we must face this terrifying monster.${prompt};Now, if he can just find that traitor and take him back to the Middle Lands...${prompt}
The sect is searching for a black sword that has the power to smash the World Eater Egg.${prompt};What are you still doing here!?
However, it seems they can't find this sword, and the alliance between the Tengu sect and the Theomilitary is in danger of falling apart, kyah...${prompt};I ordered you to leave the Far East and never return!${prompt}
Furthermore, allowing me to join the Tengu sect under the current circumstances would only make the alliance even more unlikely.${prompt};Kyah... Master, it seems that the path toward joining the Tengu sect is no longer available to me.${prompt}
Despite that, Master Gessho continues to go to the waterfall to meditate, determined to find a way to help me forward.${prompt};It pains me to say it, but I was foolish to think my plan could ever succeed, quawk...${prompt}
Kyah-kyah... However, there is little time remaining.${prompt};Little did I know, everyone has already been preparing for the day we must face this terrifying monster.${prompt}
So are you saying that you will go quietly with Zhuu Buxu back to the Middle Lands and face execution?${prompt};The sect is searching for a black sword that has the power to smash the World Eater Egg.${prompt}
Kyah... No.${prompt};However, it seems they can't find this sword, and the alliance between the Tengu sect and the Theomilitary is in danger of falling apart, kyah...${prompt}
Quawk!? You dare to deny your fate!?;Furthermore, allowing me to join the Tengu sect under the current circumstances would only make the alliance even more unlikely.${prompt}
Master Zhuu Buxu... It is good to see you again, old comrade.${prompt};Despite that, Master Gessho continues to go to the waterfall to meditate, determined to find a way to help me forward.${prompt}
Quawk! Gessho, what are you doing here!?${prompt};Kyah-kyah... However, there is little time remaining.${prompt}
I have been working to secure the alliance between the Theomilitary and the Tengu sect.${prompt};So are you saying that you will go quietly with Zhuu Buxu back to the Middle Lands and face execution?${prompt}
Well, it is still early to be talking about any possible alliance.;Kyah... No.${prompt}
Nii Aquu, come and surrender quietly!${prompt};Quawk!? You dare to deny your fate!?
Kyah-kyah! No, I refuse to go with you!${prompt};Master Zhuu Buxu... It is good to see you again, old comrade.${prompt}
You what!?${prompt};Quawk! Gessho, what are you doing here!?${prompt}
Quawk... There is only one path left before me now...${prompt};I have been working to secure the alliance between the Theomilitary and the Tengu sect.${prompt}
I must defeat you in battle!;Well, it is still early to be talking about any possible alliance.
Hahahaha! Have you gone mad?;Nii Aquu, come and surrender quietly!${prompt}
A priest is no match for an assassin!${prompt};Kyah-kyah! No, I refuse to go with you!${prompt}
Quawk! I have been training with my master here!${prompt};You what!?${prompt}
Kyah!? A Yagudo, calling a smoothskin master!?${prompt};Quawk... There is only one path left before me now...${prompt}
In that case, I shall teach you and your master a lesson you'll never forget!${prompt};I must defeat you in battle!
Come and face your destiny!;Hahahaha! Have you gone mad?
Ungh...;A priest is no match for an assassin!${prompt}
I-impossible... How could I have lost...${prompt};Quawk! I have been training with my master here!${prompt}
Master Zhuu Buxu, it appears you underestimated your opponent...${prompt};Kyah!? A Yagudo, calling a smoothskin master!?${prompt}
This is no good! No good at all!;In that case, I shall teach you and your master a lesson you'll never forget!${prompt}
Huh!?;Come and face your destiny!
Didja get in a fight!?;Ungh...
Which one of youse won?${prompt};I-impossible... How could I have lost...${prompt}
Curse you, Goblin... Was this your plan all along!?${prompt};Master Zhuu Buxu, it appears you underestimated your opponent...${prompt}
You wanted to see us Yagudo fight each other while you gloated from afar...${prompt};This is no good! No good at all!
Huh? Whaddya talkin' 'bout?${prompt};Huh!?
No, it is the exact opposite, in fact.;Didja get in a fight!?
Master Incantrix here wishes to be our friend.${prompt};Which one of youse won?${prompt}
Be our friend? Nonsense!${prompt};Curse you, Goblin... Was this your plan all along!?${prompt}
My beloved li'l brother want people, Goblins, Yagudo, and beastmen to all be friends!${prompt};You wanted to see us Yagudo fight each other while you gloated from afar...${prompt}
So youse need to make up already!;Huh? Whaddya talkin' 'bout?${prompt}
It don't matter who win or lose!${prompt};No, it is the exact opposite, in fact.
Hahahahaha! That's never going to happen!${prompt};Master Incantrix here wishes to be our friend.${prompt}
Master Zhuu Buxu?${prompt};Be our friend? Nonsense!${prompt}
I lost... If that is not considered a failure, I don't know what is.${prompt};My beloved li'l brother want people, Goblins, Yagudo, and beastmen to all be friends!${prompt}
At any rate, I shall return to the Middle Lands and report to the Manifest.;So youse need to make up already!
You can do as you please!${prompt};It don't matter who win or lose!${prompt}
Urgh!;Hahahahaha! That's never going to happen!${prompt}
Master Zhuu Buxu...${prompt};Master Zhuu Buxu?${prompt}
Huh!? Nii Aquu won!?;I lost... If that is not considered a failure, I don't know what is.${prompt}
Youse earn yer freedom!?${prompt};At any rate, I shall return to the Middle Lands and report to the Manifest.
Yes, but the Tengu sect may still refuse to take you in.;You can do as you please!${prompt}
I suggest you leave before you're found.${prompt};Urgh!
Hooray! Youse did it, Nii Aquu!${prompt};Master Zhuu Buxu...${prompt}
Kyah... No, it looks like I won't be so lucky...${prompt};Huh!? Nii Aquu won!?
Nii Aquu, I never expected that one as weak as you could defeat a trained assassin from the Middle Lands.${prompt};Youse earn yer freedom!?${prompt}
Furthermore, Master Zhuu Buxu... I am disappointed that you would admit defeat so readily.${prompt};Yes, but the Tengu sect may still refuse to take you in.
Unlike you, my role is simple and clearly defined. It has nothing to do with the dealings between the Tengu sect and the Theomilitary.${prompt};I suggest you leave before you're found.${prompt}
I was sent to track down and capture this individual, and I failed.;Hooray! Youse did it, Nii Aquu!${prompt}
I am prepared to accept the punishment for my incompetence.${prompt};Kyah... No, it looks like I won't be so lucky...${prompt}
Yes, I can see that our cause is different, as is our resolve.${prompt};Nii Aquu, I never expected that one as weak as you could defeat a trained assassin from the Middle Lands.${prompt}
Justice must be served in order to secure the future of the Far East!;Furthermore, Master Zhuu Buxu... I am disappointed that you would admit defeat so readily.${prompt}
Gessho, why did you stop me!?;Unlike you, my role is simple and clearly defined. It has nothing to do with the dealings between the Tengu sect and the Theomilitary.${prompt}
You dare to stand in the way of justice!?${prompt};I was sent to track down and capture this individual, and I failed.
Commander Reikuu, much like you, I also seek to protect the future of the Far East.${prompt};I am prepared to accept the punishment for my incompetence.${prompt}
However, I do not feel there is anything just about the path you are choosing to take here!${prompt};Yes, I can see that our cause is different, as is our resolve.${prompt}
Given the current situation, you still speak such nonsense!?;Justice must be served in order to secure the future of the Far East!
You think yours is the only correct path!?${prompt};Gessho, why did you stop me!?
No, I am still searching for my path as well.;You dare to stand in the way of justice!?${prompt}
Commander Reikuu, if you would meditate with me...${prompt};Commander Reikuu, much like you, I also seek to protect the future of the Far East.${prompt}
Silence!;However, I do not feel there is anything just about the path you are choosing to take here!${prompt}
Hey, why's Tengu Yagudo after Nii Aquu?${prompt};Given the current situation, you still speak such nonsense!?
It don't seem right! He's gotten stronger!;You think yours is the only correct path!?${prompt}
That's what we need now--strong allies!${prompt};No, I am still searching for my path as well.
You are exactly right, Master Incantrix!${prompt};Commander Reikuu, if you would meditate with me...${prompt}
...;Silence!
Alas!;Hey, why's Tengu Yagudo after Nii Aquu?${prompt}
Hmm...;It don't seem right! He's gotten stronger!
It seems you will not listen to reason.;That's what we need now--strong allies!${prompt}
You leave me with no choice!;You are exactly right, Master Incantrix!${prompt}
${name-player}, I could use your assistance in this battle!${prompt};...
Lord Gessho...what rubbish you spew at times.${prompt};Alas!
Ungh...;Hmm...
How could I lose...${prompt};It seems you will not listen to reason.
It is quite simple, really.;You leave me with no choice!
I had ${name-player} on my side.${prompt};${name-player}, I could use your assistance in this battle!${prompt}
Taking on powerful enemies requires you to have equally powerful allies.${prompt};Lord Gessho...what rubbish you spew at times.${prompt}
Therefore, I feel that we should welcome Master Nii Aquu, who has grown considerably in strength, into the Tengu sect.${prompt};Ungh...
Hehehe... You never cease to amuse me.${prompt};How could I lose...${prompt}
Though you say that Nii Aquu has grown stronger, he is but a single individual.${prompt};It is quite simple, really.
And by sacrificing that one individual, we can gain the strength of an entire army of Yagudo through an alliance with the Theomilitary.${prompt};I had ${name-player} on my side.${prompt}
However, this lone individual came to Reisenjima with an uncommon determination to join the ranks of the Far East, did he not?${prompt};Taking on powerful enemies requires you to have equally powerful allies.${prompt}
He engaged in unorthodox training methods, just so that he could gain the strength to be accepted here.;Therefore, I feel that we should welcome Master Nii Aquu, who has grown considerably in strength, into the Tengu sect.${prompt}
Indeed, his actions more than lived up to his words.${prompt};Hehehe... You never cease to amuse me.${prompt}
Yeah! Youse said you were gonna get stronger!;Though you say that Nii Aquu has grown stronger, he is but a single individual.${prompt}
And so you did!${prompt};And by sacrificing that one individual, we can gain the strength of an entire army of Yagudo through an alliance with the Theomilitary.${prompt}
Urgh...;However, this lone individual came to Reisenjima with an uncommon determination to join the ranks of the Far East, did he not?${prompt}
If it weren't for the archpriest's specific instructions, I would deal with you personally...${prompt};He engaged in unorthodox training methods, just so that he could gain the strength to be accepted here.
Indeed. And why exactly did the archpriest specify that we are not to harm the Goblin?${prompt};Indeed, his actions more than lived up to his words.${prompt}
Grrr...;Yeah! Youse said you were gonna get stronger!
He considers the Goblins living on Reisenjima to be citizens of the Far East...${prompt};And so you did!${prompt}
Exactly. We need every citizen of the Far East to work together when it comes time to fight the monster that hatches from the egg.${prompt};Urgh...
There are more than just smoothskins and Yagudo living in the Far East, including various spirits and monsters as well.${prompt};If it weren't for the archpriest's specific instructions, I would deal with you personally...${prompt}
The Mikado is constantly worried about how to best unite such disparate entities around a common goal.${prompt};Indeed. And why exactly did the archpriest specify that we are not to harm the Goblin?${prompt}
However, he realizes now that good intentions alone may not be enough.;Grrr...
And the Mikado and the archpriest are not wrong to think that.${prompt};He considers the Goblins living on Reisenjima to be citizens of the Far East...${prompt}
Isn't that why they decided to enter talks with the Theomilitary about forming an alliance?${prompt};Exactly. We need every citizen of the Far East to work together when it comes time to fight the monster that hatches from the egg.${prompt}
Yet because of those talks, we must turn our backs on those who already live here?${prompt};There are more than just smoothskins and Yagudo living in the Far East, including various spirits and monsters as well.${prompt}
Grrr... I refuse to accept it, and I doubt the archpriest will either.${prompt};The Mikado is constantly worried about how to best unite such disparate entities around a common goal.${prompt}
In fact, no one here will accept Nii Aquu as a citizen of the Far East!${prompt};However, he realizes now that good intentions alone may not be enough.
The Tengu sect is as stubborn as ever, I see.${prompt};And the Mikado and the archpriest are not wrong to think that.${prompt}
You may not accept it, but what about that Goblin over there?;Isn't that why they decided to enter talks with the Theomilitary about forming an alliance?${prompt}
He is a citizen of the Far East too, is he not?${prompt};Yet because of those talks, we must turn our backs on those who already live here?${prompt}
Ah, yes! I's accept it!;Grrr... I refuse to accept it, and I doubt the archpriest will either.${prompt}
I's accept Nii Aquu as my new brother!${prompt};In fact, no one here will accept Nii Aquu as a citizen of the Far East!${prompt}
Kyah-kyah!?;The Tengu sect is as stubborn as ever, I see.${prompt}
Wh-what did you say!?;You may not accept it, but what about that Goblin over there?
My new brother! Nii Aquu, I hope youse ready for it!${prompt};He is a citizen of the Far East too, is he not?${prompt}
I cannot believe this...;Ah, yes! I's accept it!
Give up already, Reikuu. Even I can see you've lost.;I's accept Nii Aquu as my new brother!${prompt}
Your path is not the right one.${prompt};Kyah-kyah!?
Yet, what is to become of my mission to unite the Tengu sect and the Theomilitary...${prompt};Wh-what did you say!?
Commander Reikuu... Join me, and together we will search for this Goblin hero who wields the black sword.${prompt};My new brother! Nii Aquu, I hope youse ready for it!${prompt}
Rest assured, I have traveled extensively and am fluent in any language we might encounter.${prompt};I cannot believe this...
Ah! I's just remembered somethin'!;Give up already, Reikuu. Even I can see you've lost.
This is trouble! Big trouble!${prompt};Your path is not the right one.${prompt}
Kyah-kyah!?;Yet, what is to become of my mission to unite the Tengu sect and the Theomilitary...${prompt}
I's tried contactin' the Goblin hero!${prompt};Commander Reikuu... Join me, and together we will search for this Goblin hero who wields the black sword.${prompt}
But it's no use! No response!;Rest assured, I have traveled extensively and am fluent in any language we might encounter.${prompt}
The hero, his friends...nowhere to be found!${prompt};Ah! I's just remembered somethin'!
What!? What about the black sword then!?${prompt};This is trouble! Big trouble!${prompt}
It's gone too... I's thinkin' it disappeared with the hero!;Kyah-kyah!?
So like I say, big trouble! There's nobody to smash the egg!${prompt};I's tried contactin' the Goblin hero!${prompt}
Kyah...;But it's no use! No response!
Incantrix, is there any way to forge another one of these black swords?${prompt};The hero, his friends...nowhere to be found!${prompt}
Hmm... It is secret, known only to Goblins.${prompt};What!? What about the black sword then!?${prompt}
Although, youse become my Goblin brother today.;It's gone too... I's thinkin' it disappeared with the hero!
I's can tell you, but everyone else, pretend to not listen.${prompt};So like I say, big trouble! There's nobody to smash the egg!${prompt}
Quawk! Quawk! Are you sure about this!?${prompt};Kyah...
Five thousand years ago, the evil Chaos tried to destroy all that was new, includin' the world itself.${prompt};Incantrix, is there any way to forge another one of these black swords?${prompt}
Five thousand years ago, the strongest of these new beings joined forces.${prompt};Hmm... It is secret, known only to Goblins.${prompt}
But Chaos was strong. It die and come back many times.;Although, youse become my Goblin brother today.
Die then reborn, die then reborn...;I's can tell you, but everyone else, pretend to not listen.${prompt}
Chaos protected a powerful crystal, much stronger than power of the phoenix.;Quawk! Quawk! Are you sure about this!?${prompt}
So, weapon more powerful than crystal needed to destroy it.;Five thousand years ago, the evil Chaos tried to destroy all that was new, includin' the world itself.${prompt}
This special weapon require individual with strong soul.${prompt};Five thousand years ago, the strongest of these new beings joined forces.${prompt}
So, bearer of the soul, wise Dvergar demon, create these black weapons.${prompt};But Chaos was strong. It die and come back many times.
Not just swords either, all kinds of weapons.;Die then reborn, die then reborn...
Also, not just Goblins carryin' them--all kinds of mighty beings.;Chaos protected a powerful crystal, much stronger than power of the phoenix.
But everyone vanish. Die in the battle against Chaos.;So, weapon more powerful than crystal needed to destroy it.
Only Goblin hero with black sword left.${prompt};This special weapon require individual with strong soul.${prompt}
That's all I's know.${prompt};So, bearer of the soul, wise Dvergar demon, create these black weapons.${prompt}
Kyah... So the black sword was forged by a Dvergar demon...${prompt};Not just swords either, all kinds of weapons.
Kyah-kyah! So if we ask another Dvergar, we just might be able to forge another black sword!${prompt};Also, not just Goblins carryin' them--all kinds of mighty beings.
No! What if demon asks for yer soul in order to make blade!?${prompt};But everyone vanish. Die in the battle against Chaos.
The Dvergar are not an easy lot to deal with.;Only Goblin hero with black sword left.${prompt}
However...${prompt};That's all I's know.${prompt}
The Theomilitary is familiar with demons from its experience forging an alliance with the Shadow Lord.;Kyah... So the black sword was forged by a Dvergar demon...${prompt}
As such, they may be able to negotiate a deal.${prompt};Kyah-kyah! So if we ask another Dvergar, we just might be able to forge another black sword!${prompt}
Furthermore, this could allow the Manifest to be viewed as a hero...;No! What if demon asks for yer soul in order to make blade!?${prompt}
It may go a long way in helping to cement the alliance between the two parties.${prompt};The Dvergar are not an easy lot to deal with.
Master Incantrix, do you mind if we share this story with others?${prompt};However...${prompt}
Lalalala.♪${prompt};The Theomilitary is familiar with demons from its experience forging an alliance with the Shadow Lord.
Indeed, Gessho. We only learned of this story because Nii Aquu was taken in as a Goblin.${prompt};As such, they may be able to negotiate a deal.${prompt}
If we mention that fact, it may be enough to get the Theomilitary to pardon him.${prompt};Furthermore, this could allow the Manifest to be viewed as a hero...
!?;It may go a long way in helping to cement the alliance between the two parties.${prompt}
Kyah-kyah! Thank you so much, Master Zhuu Buxu!${prompt};Master Incantrix, do you mind if we share this story with others?${prompt}
This way, I wouldn't have to admit that you bested me in battle, and I won't face punishment for my failure.${prompt};Lalalala.♪${prompt}
Master Zhuu Buxu, it seems I am in your debt once more.${prompt};Indeed, Gessho. We only learned of this story because Nii Aquu was taken in as a Goblin.${prompt}
What do you say, Reikuu?;If we mention that fact, it may be enough to get the Theomilitary to pardon him.${prompt}
This solves everyone's problem, so I can't help but think it is the path we should take.${prompt};!?
Very well. Time is of the essence, so I shall report to the archpriest immediately and prepare a letter for the Theomilitary.${prompt};Kyah-kyah! Thank you so much, Master Zhuu Buxu!${prompt}
Master Incantrix. Master Nii Aquu.;This way, I wouldn't have to admit that you bested me in battle, and I won't face punishment for my failure.${prompt}
I hope we can put this rather unfortunate business behind us.${prompt};Master Zhuu Buxu, it seems I am in your debt once more.${prompt}
Mwahaha.♪;What do you say, Reikuu?
If it's fer my new brother, Nii Aquu, I's have no choice I guess!${prompt};This solves everyone's problem, so I can't help but think it is the path we should take.${prompt}
Kyah-kyah, thank you so much.${prompt};Very well. Time is of the essence, so I shall report to the archpriest immediately and prepare a letter for the Theomilitary.${prompt}
${name-player}, please come pay me a visit later.${prompt};Master Incantrix. Master Nii Aquu.
You recall that Reikuu told you to pay a visit later.${prompt};I hope we can put this rather unfortunate business behind us.${prompt}
${name-player}, I would like to thank you for your assistance.${prompt};Mwahaha.♪
Furthermore, I must apologize for the impolite nature in which I have treated you.${prompt};If it's fer my new brother, Nii Aquu, I's have no choice I guess!${prompt}
Now that I think about it, our newfound harmony is all due to your efforts.${prompt};Kyah-kyah, thank you so much.${prompt}
Thanks to you, we have formed a relationship with the Goblins and also managed to repair the divide between the Yagudo factions.;${name-player}, please come pay me a visit later.${prompt}
In addition, we were also able to discover our previously lost history.${prompt};You recall that Reikuu told you to pay a visit later.${prompt}
Gessho tells me that you are a mercenary and also an adventurer, and that you are unwilling to serve in the Far East ranks directly.${prompt};${name-player}, I would like to thank you for your assistance.${prompt}
However, I would like to ask for your assistance once more when the impending danger finally reaches our shores.${prompt};Furthermore, I must apologize for the impolite nature in which I have treated you.${prompt}
In preparation for that day, I would like to present you with this symbol of our friendship.${prompt};Now that I think about it, our newfound harmony is all due to your efforts.${prompt}
Master! I also received one as well!${prompt};Thanks to you, we have formed a relationship with the Goblins and also managed to repair the divide between the Yagudo factions.
I have reported what transpired here to the archpriest.${prompt};In addition, we were also able to discover our previously lost history.${prompt}
He has ordered that in recognition of Nii Aquu's service, he be given the chance to officially join the Tengu sect.${prompt};Gessho tells me that you are a mercenary and also an adventurer, and that you are unwilling to serve in the Far East ranks directly.${prompt}
Kyah-kyah! I know it will be difficult to adapt to the ways of the Far East, but I vow to do my best!${prompt};However, I would like to ask for your assistance once more when the impending danger finally reaches our shores.${prompt}
Although, Master Incantrix was slightly upset about the matter.${prompt};In preparation for that day, I would like to present you with this symbol of our friendship.${prompt}
Since by joining the Tengu sect, I'm forced to give up my status as a Goblin...${prompt};Master! I also received one as well!${prompt}
Quawk! However, that doesn't change the fact that we're now brothers, so I'll still be doing what I can to help him!${prompt};I have reported what transpired here to the archpriest.${prompt}
As for the prime weapon and the war that took place five thousand years ago...;He has ordered that in recognition of Nii Aquu's service, he be given the chance to officially join the Tengu sect.${prompt}
He still has agreed to convey everything he knows to the Theomilitary.${prompt};Kyah-kyah! I know it will be difficult to adapt to the ways of the Far East, but I vow to do my best!${prompt}
Indeed... The more I learn about this battle against Chaos five thousand years ago, the more fearful I become...${prompt};Although, Master Incantrix was slightly upset about the matter.${prompt}
We also can't overlook that the Goblin hero in possession of the black sword has gone missing.;Since by joining the Tengu sect, I'm forced to give up my status as a Goblin...${prompt}
I wonder what happened to him...${prompt};Quawk! However, that doesn't change the fact that we're now brothers, so I'll still be doing what I can to help him!${prompt}
${name-player}, if you hear any news of this Goblin hero in your travels, I ask that you bring word back to us at once.${prompt};As for the prime weapon and the war that took place five thousand years ago...
As long as his status remains unknown, I feel there is a big piece to the puzzle that we are missing.${prompt};He still has agreed to convey everything he knows to the Theomilitary.${prompt}

${name-player}, all that has been accomplished here we owe to you.${prompt};${name-player}, if you hear any news of this Goblin hero in your travels, I ask that you bring word back to us at once.${prompt}

${name-player}, all that has been accomplished here we owe to you.${prompt};My, it seems a rather solemn mood has set in.${prompt}
Gessho informs me that you are an adventurer--perhaps a mercenary of sorts?--so it would be inappropriate of me to ask you to be a part of the Far East's standing forces...${prompt};${name-player}, I would like to offer you this as a token of my appreciation for all that you have done.${prompt}
