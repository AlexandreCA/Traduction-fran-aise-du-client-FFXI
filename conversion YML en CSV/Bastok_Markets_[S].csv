<Sniff, sniff>;
I think I can smell my next level!;
Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!${prompt};
I tell you what.;
Changing your weapon is fun.;
Seriously.${prompt};
It's always nice to come outside and move around!;
Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy!;
Wanna race?${prompt};
...;
We should keep the chat down.;
The sound could give our position away to some beastman...${prompt};
It's all very well and good to be heroic.;
But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle.;
Overcautious? Perhaps.${prompt};
Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation?;
Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?${prompt};
You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.${prompt};
You called? How may I be of service?;
You need but ask, and it shall be done!${prompt};
I love to chat.;
But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters.;
Just in case.${prompt};
Treasure?;
I'm not really interested.;
You go ahead and keep it all.${prompt};
I just realized something.;
I've never once had Signet cast on me.;
Oh well, never mind...${prompt};
Communication is really important.;
We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right?;
No secrets!${prompt};
It's all very well and good to be heroic.;
But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle.;
Overcautious? Perhaps.${prompt};
There is a time and place for idle chatter.;
No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.${prompt};
She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee.♪;
The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!♪${prompt};
Fight or evade?;
I'll leave those decisions up to you.;
Either is fine with me.${prompt};
Battle strategy!;
We should work together, you know.;
I know some great weapon skills!${prompt};
No need to worry.;
I've had training in all sorts of weapons.;
Try me.${prompt};
Look at the time.;
We could spend all day chatting like this.;
Not that we have to be fighting...${prompt};
......;
S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say.;
I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...${prompt};
Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight.;
Next time we should do something different--something fun!${prompt};
While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?${prompt};
It's surprising.;
There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls.;
I spend too much time in clothes stores.${prompt};
Listen.;
Let me know if you want me to take the heat.;
I can take it!${prompt};
I like the outdoors.;
Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns.;
So relaxing...${prompt};
Hey!;
It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you.;
We get to see all kinds of things!${prompt};
Look at the time.;
We could spend all day chatting like this.;
Not that we have to be fighting...${prompt};
If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!${prompt};
Heal the worrrld.♪;
Make it a better place.♪;
For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.♪${prompt};
Is that a yawn?;
Be careful to get enough sleep.;
It could affect your performance in battle.${prompt};
You know me!;
I can take the hits.;
Just bring it on!${prompt};
...;
Sometimes...;
I just like to be quiet...${prompt};
A small reminder:;
We should be extra careful out here.;
You never know when an enemy may be near...${prompt};
Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean...;
I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh...;
Nevermind... <Sigh>${prompt};
You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?${prompt};
Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.${prompt};
By the way.;
You don't have to handle everything yourself.;
I can take the frontline sometimes, too.${prompt};
Ah, this is fun!;
I love visiting different places.;
Don't you?${prompt};
By the way.;
I'll be there for you, no matter what.;
Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.${prompt};
You never know when something bad is going to happen.;
What's that over there!?;
Kidding!${prompt};
A small reminder:;
We should be extra careful out here.;
You never know when an enemy may be near...${prompt};
Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way.;
But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.${prompt};
Huh...?;

That was number ${number: 0}.${prompt};
I'd say we've blasted through around ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[enemy/enemies] by now!${prompt};
How many enemies have we defeated?;
Hmm, around ${number: 0}...${prompt};
You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies?;
The last villain we defeated brings us to number ${number: 0}.${prompt};
You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far?;
Let me check... It's ${number: 0}.${prompt};

Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.${prompt};
Our progress, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/milady]?;

How many enemies have we downed?;
Umm...around ${number: 0}.;
I think.${prompt};
You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies?;
The last villain we defeated brings us to number ${number: 0}.${prompt};
Our tally stands at a meager ${number: 0} enemies.;
This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!${prompt};
We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.${prompt};
Defeated enemies?;
That was number ${number: 0}, I believe.${prompt};
I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[enemy/enemies] today!${prompt};
Enemies defeated?;
I wasn't really keeping track.;
Around ${number: 0}, I suppose...${prompt};

I believe our total comes to ${number: 0}.${prompt};

What would you like to know?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing. I'm sorry.;
About performance assessment.;
About Allied Tags.;
About temporary items.;
About Unions.${prompt};
I am sorry, but at this time, I cannot be of any assistance in that area.${prompt};
Understood. I shall now judge your performance and award the proper remuneration.${prompt};
Ah, I'm sorry to inform you that your performance has not earned you any compensation.${prompt};
Understood. I shall prepare a new set of tags for you now.${prompt};
You've already undergone an evaluation for this battle, or had you forgotten?;
As much as I'd like to, I'm forbidden from providing you with a new set of Allied Taegs until the next battle begins.${prompt};
Anyone wearing Allied Tags while participating in a campaign battle will be judged on their overall performance.${prompt};
Soldiers will be evaluated not only on their fighting skills, but also on how much they contribute to the efforts of their allies through means such as healing and enhancing.${prompt};
However, beware that if you leave the area before being assessed, you will be deemed a deserter and will forfeit all rewards earned that day.${prompt};
Also, while there are no immediate penalties for being knocked out, falling in battle will significantly lower the score given to you.${prompt};
When you are ready to receive compensation for your work on the field, return to me and I shall assess your performance and provide you with your payment.${prompt};
Allied Tags are a special type of identification given to all participants of Allied Campaign battles.${prompt};
There are benefits, as well as drawbacks, to wearing the tags. One of the benefits is that in the case you are knocked out on the battlefield, you will not lose any experience points.${prompt};
However, some of the drawbacks include the inability to improve skills and earn experience points for individual kills, as well as the right to loot fallen enemies.${prompt};
Temporary items can be purchased in exchange for Allied Notes.${prompt};
There are several different varieties of items, but they all have one thing in common--they can only be used on the battlefield they were issued.${prompt};
It is highly recommended that you first survey a battle's conditions and then select the supplies that you believe will benefit you most.${prompt};
Please remember that all temporary items you carry on your person will be confiscated in the event that you leave the area.${prompt};
You can only purchase temporary items if your nation of allegiance is commanding the campaign.${prompt};
That is all.${prompt};
I will require a teleportation fee of ${number: 0} Allied Note${choice-plurality: 0}[/s]. I see you currently possess ${number: 2}.${prompt};

Spondulix comes all the way from Boodlix's Emporium to help Tarutaru and Mithra. I can help you, too! You have gil, no?${prompt};

I am sorry, ${name-player}, but your campaign medal has expired. I cannot issue tags to anyone not authorized by the Allied Forces. Return to your nation's capital and speak with a Campaign Evaluation Official.${prompt};
Oh ho! Keen to join a Union, are we?;
Very well. Listen up and I shall tell you all you need to know.${prompt};
In order to better coordinate Allied efforts against the beastman menace, we have instituted a system of ad hoc tactical regiments called “Unions.” With five units to a battlefield, union registration is open to any proven soldier in possession of Allied Tags.${prompt};
In return for their aid in advancing the war effort, union registrants will be eligible to earn a share of the spoils of war.${prompt};
Needless to say, the choicest rewards will be reserved for those unions which make the greatest contributions in combat.;
Prove your mettle on the field of battle, and you will earn glory for your union, as well as a sizable bounty of your own.${prompt};
Be forewarned that your commitment to your union comes first and foremost.;
In the aftermath of battle, you will not be permitted to reap rewards from your individual exploits until your union has distributed its plunder.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}Caution! If a union member joins or leaves an existing party, that party's treasure pool will be distributed automatically and immediately.;

Welcome, Master! This is your home, the “Mog House,” kupo!${prompt};
I'm a moogle! We moogles like taking care of houses and items! Nice to meet you, kupo!${prompt};
I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
First, the basics, kupo!;
Open your main menu, Master. The button at the very bottom changes to “Mog House” when you're in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
Press it and the “Mog House” menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!${prompt};
There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...${prompt};
So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!${prompt};
Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!${prompt};
What do you want to know about?;
${selection-lines};
The Mog Safe.;
Storage.;
The Delivery Box.;
Changing jobs.;
Gardening.;
Changing the layout.;
Mog House invitations.;
I got it, thanks, kupo!${prompt};
The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!${prompt};
You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!${prompt};
The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!${prompt};
You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!${prompt};
If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!${prompt};
You can send items and gil to your friends with the “Send” command, kupo!${prompt};
"(Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the ""Exclusive"" attribute, kupo...!)${prompt}";
Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!${prompt};
I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!${prompt};
And...the rest is a secret, kupo!${prompt};
All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!${prompt};
As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!${prompt};
This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...${prompt};
It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!${prompt};
If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!${prompt};
Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the “Layout” command, kupo!${prompt};
It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo!;
Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!${prompt};
You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!${prompt};
Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?${prompt};
Are you sure?;
${selection-lines};
I'm sure!;
Maybe I'm not so sure...${prompt};
And finally, a little bit of advice!${prompt};
If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!${prompt};
If you type “/ae Hello!”, then your message will be heard by many people.${prompt};
If you type “/ae” followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!${prompt};
Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!${prompt};
Okay, kupo!;
Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!${prompt};
Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?${prompt};
Ask about your Mog House again?;
${selection-lines};
Don't ask.;
Ask.${prompt};
Over the mountains and the rolling hills,;
I'll go wherever my master wills.♪${prompt};
Master!;
I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!${prompt};
But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select “Mog House” from the main menu and check, kupo!${prompt};
When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!${prompt};
Master!;
I have something to tell you, kupo!${prompt};
I found this precious item under the ${item-singular: 3[2]} pillow, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I used the ${item-singular: 3[2]} to write a song for you, kupo!${prompt};
Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!${prompt};
I found this item in the back of one of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}'s drawers, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I found this in the back of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It must be a gift from the heavens, kupo!;
Here, take it, kupo!${prompt};
I found this item inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
Luck is on your side, kupo!;
Take it, kupo!${prompt};
I fished this item out of the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, kupo!${prompt};
It was very hard work, kupo...;
I'm very tired, kupo...${prompt};
I found this behind the ${item-singular: 3[2]} painting, kupo!${prompt};
This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo!;
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
Something clattered inside the ${item-singular: 3[2]} when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!${prompt};
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
I felt there was something strange about the ${item-singular: 3[2]}, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!${prompt};
We moogles have very good intuition, kupo!;
It's all yours, kupo!${prompt};
Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!${prompt};
At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you!;
Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!${prompt};
For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.${prompt};
Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[overwhelming/powerful/faint] ${choice: 1}[fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!${prompt};
Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with ${choice: 0}[the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!${prompt};
Each item of furniture you place using the “Layout” command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!${prompt};
When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!${prompt};

I sense that this ${item-singular: 3[2]} is very, very special! You should go to the store where you bought it and ask about it, kupo!${prompt};
Master! Master!;
Look what I found underneath the ${item-singular: 3[2]} this morning, kupo!${prompt};
It has been wrapped and everything!;
I wonder who it could be from, kupo!${prompt};
Look what I found in your ${item-singular: 3[2]}!${prompt};

If you change your mind, just trade them back to me or one of my moogle egg-sociates!${prompt};
I guess you never know what you're going to find until you look for it, kupo!${prompt};
Isn't the aroma positively scrumptious?;
It's all yours, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!${prompt};
Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo!;

Master! Oh, master, look!;
We've sprung a leak, kupo!;
Just look at it drip, drip, dripping away!${prompt};
What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo!;
But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!${prompt};
Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess!;
Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!${prompt};
Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!${prompt};
Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo.;
We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!${prompt};
I figure all I'll need is a good ${item-singular: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!${prompt};
Could I trouble you to track them down?;
While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.${prompt};
And do hurry, Master!;
Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...${prompt};
Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House!;
Bring this to me when we're back home in ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?${prompt};
You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you.;
That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. “Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all!”;
Now we just take these, and...${prompt};
Kupoooooo～there you have it! Better than new!;
Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!${prompt};
Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.${prompt};
But wouldn't you know it, kupo?;
It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!${prompt};
You know the one, right across from Durable Shields.;
Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?${prompt};
Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here.;
Come, Master, we're off to Jeuno!${prompt};

We all got together and made you a new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 80 items, kupo!${prompt};
Well met! I am Wahid, a gem dealer of some repute.;
If you're a ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] of class--<ahem!>--you've doubtless already heard of me.${prompt};
Despite my copious wealth, I am a simple man of simple pleasures.;
Sell jewels by the cartload, and use the ample proceeds to wine and dine on the Republic's finest fare...I ask for little else.;
Sadly, this accursed war has cut off my supply line, putting a dent in my profits and forcing me to subside on--<gasp!>--commoner's fare.${prompt};
Alas! 'Tis a fate worse than death.;
But you seem the capable sort, so perhaps you could lend me a hand.;
What's that?;
Where lies the market for gems in the midst of a war, you say?${prompt};
Oh ho! Allow me to let you in on the secret of my success.;
My loyal wife, you see, is a goldsmith of unparalleled skill.;
She fashions the gemstones I procure into rings so breathtaking that it is said mothers have let their children go hungry just to own one!${prompt};
Ah-ha-ha! Oh-ho-ho-<cough, hack>;
Ahem! But I jest.${prompt};
At any rate, see if you can locate the three stones I seek.;
Rest assured that I can make it very much worth your while.${prompt};
Acquire one of each and I will purchase the set from you at a handsome price.${prompt};
Oho! I knew I could count on you!;
After all, my sterling character judgment is quite renowned in the Bastokan merchant circle.${prompt};
Ah, yes! Splendiferous! Magnificent!;
I need only sell these, and I'll have wine enough to bathe in!${prompt};
What say you to 50,000 gil for the lot of them?;
You see? My far-famed generosity knows no bounds!${prompt};
Sell the three gems for 50,000 gil?;
${selection-lines};
Show me the money!;
On second thought...${prompt};
Wahid! What's all this hubbub?;
I could hear your blathering all the way from my studio!${prompt};
Oh, there you are, my dear! You couldn't have picked a finer time to come.${prompt};
This is my wife Swantje, of whom I spoke.;
And this, my dear, is the industrious young ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] who has brought the gems that will make me--<ahem!>, I mean us--rich beyond our wildest dreams!${prompt};
So hop to it, honey.;
Work your magic on these beauties!${prompt};
Wahid...;
Must you truly go on with this?${prompt};
Even the most precious gem that never leaves its jewel casket is naught but a lonely rock.${prompt};
Bastok is at war...or haven't you noticed?;
In these hard times, it is all folk like us can do to get through each day with food on our tables and our loved ones' lives intact.;
Still you look only to profit off the sale of these luxuries?${prompt};
Ahahaha! Bwahahaha--<cough, hack>.;
Please stop, my dear, lest I bust a gut from laughter!${prompt};
'Tis precisely because our lives may end at any moment that I choose to make the most of the time I have.;
If some vainglorious goodwife is willing to lighten her purse to that end, who am I to stand in the way?;
Would you deny me that?${prompt};
But Wahid...is there not a greater good we could be serving?${prompt};
A truer cause that calls for our aid?${prompt};
In these trying times, it is not lavish baubles that renew people's spirits, but hopes and dreams of a brighter future!${prompt};
Here is what I propose.;
Forget precious gems. We can fashion a new line of goods to sell at a more modest price.${prompt};
What if you could find...yes, the mystic stones spoken of in the old legends.;
I could fashion them into good-luck charms. Anything to give the fearful townsfolk a dose of hope and courage.${prompt};
Mystic stones? Good-luck charms?;
Bwahahahahahaha!${prompt};
You're quite the jokester today, my dear!;
Even if such things existed--which I doubt they do--why should I break my back hunting down pebbles that would bring but a pittance in return?${prompt};
You may have talent, but let us not forget that it's me and my prodigious gem acquisition skills that put the food on our table.${prompt};
Hopes? Dreams? Courage? P'shaw!;
I'm a businessman--a successful one at that--and I intend to stay that way.${prompt};
"If the mushy sentiments of the rabble are of such concern to you, maybe you should go find your precious ""mystic stones"" yourself!${prompt}";
There she goes again.;
Oh well, can't say I didn't try to talk some sense into her.${prompt};
I'm afraid we'll have to put our little transaction on hold.${prompt};
She's a willful one, but without her skills, those stones won't sell for a tenth of what I offered you.${prompt};
But worry not, friend! She'll come around, as she always does.;
My infallible merchant's instincts tell me so.${prompt};
It won't be long before we're all rolling in gil.;
Ahahaha! Bwahahahahahaha--<cough, hack>.${prompt};
Oh ho! There you are!;
Sorry you had to witness our little lovers' spat the other day. Hohoho...${prompt};
Actually, speaking of my wife...;
You haven't perchance seen her around, have you?${prompt};
It pains me to say this, but she hasn't been back home since that day.${prompt};
Wherever could she have run off to?${prompt};
I don't mean to turn you into my errand ${choice-player-gender}[boy/girl], but perhaps you could take a look around for her?${prompt};
It appears my infallible merchant's instincts aren't quite what they used to be.;
Ahahaha!${prompt};
Please do let me know if you find any word of my wife.;
Hahaha, what's gotten into me? A businessman like me should have nerves of darksteel...${prompt};
Oh, it's you.;
Pray tell, have you any news of Swantje?${prompt};
Break the news to Wahid?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Not yet.${prompt};
What's that you say!?;
You expect me to believe such nonsense?${prompt};
After all, it's not as if you have any proof, correct?;
No, a shrewd businessman trusts no eyes but his own!${prompt};
Ah...'tis a shame.${prompt};
Should you uncover any word of Swantje--anything at all!--come back at once.;
I beg of you!${prompt};
Ah, I've been waiting for you!;
Have a look at this letter. I found it as I was searching my house just a moment ago.${prompt};
Here, you can read it along with me.;
Perhaps it might offer us a clue as to Swantje's whereabouts.${prompt};
${prompt};
My dearest husband,;
Forgive me for running off in a huff like that...sometimes I allow my emotions to get the better of me.;
${prompt};
I imagine you're asking yourself where I came up with that far-fetched notion of mystic stones.;
${prompt};
I meant not to anger you.;
Still, I fear that if I were to say this face-to-face, I would succeed only in incurring your ire once more.;
And so, I put ink to parchment.;
${prompt};
Do you remember the ring you gave me on our wedding day?;
${prompt};
So unique, so lovely...it piqued my curiosity from the start.;
Recently I learned that it was one of the early works of a highly celebrated goldsmith.;
${prompt};
The story has it that this goldsmith intended to set the ring with one of the stones of legend.;
Though they do not shine as bright as diamonds--nor any other precious gem--it is said that they;
would bring lifelong happiness to any couple.${prompt};
Did you know?;
Ever the businessman, you were doubtless more concerned with its glitter than its history...;
${prompt};
Still, in these dark times...I thought we could work together to provide that same hope and;
happiness to the disheartened populace.;
I wanted this with all my heart.;
${prompt};
Call me a sentimental little girl, but this is why I sought your aid in finding the stones.;
And why I now go in search of them...on my own...;
${prompt};
I know you are still angry at me. But I promise you...;
I will find the stone and fashion the most beautiful ring the three nations have ever seen.;
That day, I hope you can forgive me.;
${prompt};
Yours,;
Swantje;
${prompt};
What is that woman thinking!?;
She's always been pigheaded, but to think she was actually serious about going on that wild crystal chase! And alone, to boot!${prompt};
Hmmm? What was that look on your face just now?;
Is there something you're not telling me?${prompt};
Show Wahid the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
Not yet.${prompt};
You can't pull one over on old Wahid.;
There's something you're not telling me. Now, out with it!${prompt};
Why, this...this is the wedding ring I gave Swantje!${prompt};
What were you doing with it?${prompt};
Where did you find this, I say!?${prompt};
You're hiding something from me, I know it!;
Out with it before I lose my patience!${prompt};
No...it can't...;
D-damn you! You're...you're trying to trick me...;
You--${prompt};
You are the jeweler Wahid, correct?${prompt};
I am afraid I bring somber news.;
Our border patrol has reported a citizen slain in the vicinity of the Palborough Mines.${prompt};
The victim has been confirmed as your wife, Swantje.${prompt};
It appears she was targeted by a band of Quadav raiders.${prompt};
No...it can't be true...;
Oh, Goddess! Why do you forsake me so?;
How could you lead her into harm's way!;
M-my...my Swantje...<sob>${prompt};
...${prompt};
Your wife was holding this in her hand.;
I know your grief is still fresh, but take it. It is yours.${prompt};
Could it be...? ${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}!${prompt};
Back in the days when I was but a fledgling shop owner, without the resources to procure precious gems, Swantje would bring these home, and polish them until they sparkled like the starlit night sky...${prompt};
At the time, I thought them little more than pebbles...${prompt};
Ah, to return to those days!;
Our store was but a shack, these stones bringing in barely enough coin to afford the ramshackle roof over our heads...${prompt};
And yet, our travails brought us closer than we had ever been before...or have been since.;
Looking back...those were probably the happiest years of our lives.${prompt};
Swantje...${prompt};
Your wife's remains are being held in the military morgue, should you wish to pay your last respects.${prompt};
Oh...it's you again.;
Please forgive me for the other day...the grief was too much to bear.${prompt};
Since that day, this ${item-singular: 0[2]} has never left my hand.;
It's worth no more than a pebble, and isn't even much to look at.;
But I shall cherish it more than the most precious diamond.${prompt};
I've decided to take it upon myself to realize Swantje's unfulfilled dream.;
I shall collect stones like the one she gave her life to find, and do what I can to bring hope and good fortune to the people.${prompt};
Such is the least I can do to honor her memory.;
And when the day comes that I leave this world to rejoin her side, I can only hope she will forgive me...${prompt};
This ${item-singular: 0[2]} was one of her most beloved tools.${prompt};
Please take it. You're far more of a goldsmith than I.;
Perhaps someday, when you become a master, you can fashion Swantje's stone into a ring worthy of her memory.${prompt};

The hunt registry is a tome through which veteran soldiers can undertake assignments to eliminate monsters deemed to be impediments to S.M.A.N. activities.${prompt};
Assignments, or “hunts,” can be undertaken simply by selecting the name of a monster listed in the registry.${prompt};
Pertinent information such as monster elusiveness and ferocity has been recorded for your reference.;
As safety cannot be guaranteed, we ask that you hunt within your ability.${prompt};
Hunts pit you against creatures of extreme ferocity, and are not intended for training.;
For this reason, you cannot undertake a hunt while a training regime is active.${prompt};
Should party members undertaking a common hunt defeat the objective, the kill will be considered valid for all.${prompt};
Upon the completion of a hunt, record your success in a hunt registry.;
Doing so will earn you rewards corresponding to difficulty as well as “scylds”--tokens of your valor.${prompt};
More scylds will grant you access to increasingly difficult and rewarding assignments.;
Be warned, however, that once expended, scylds will not be refunded for any reason.${prompt};
Lastly, please note that a mandatory cool-down period will be imposed upon all hunters following the completion of a hunt. Until this time has elapsed, you will not be permitted to undertake another hunt.${prompt};
You record your hunt.;

And what is this? “medicine,” you say?;
Hmph, most novel. I suppose you creatures do have your redeeming qualities.${prompt};

It would seem these lands may still hold some allure yet.;

Are you...a dragoon!? That is a most welcome relief.;
I had to come and ascertain for myself whether or not there are still those to carry on the ways of our kind.${prompt};
Also, I have heard rumors of a wyrm which inhabits Grauberg. A wyrm which can take on the form of a man...${prompt};

Ahhh, so you're fighting for ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], are you?;
Hmmm, that doesn't sound half bad, actually.;
I suppose I could be persuaded to lend my services.${prompt};
If I'm going to be laying my life on the line, I may as well side with a dependable ally.;
Makes sense, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
Please, don't come any closer!;
I was raised by beasts, you see, and, well...it's the smell. I feel saturated by it.;
Iron, perfumes, spices... I can taste your stink and every time I do I feel I have somehow been infected by it.${prompt};
Awww, you reek of parchmentaru...;

Alright, let's get a move on, then.;
My friend is getting tired of being told to “stay.”${prompt};

Hm, me? Why, I'm Maruna-Kurina, the travel-waveling genius scholar!;
You won't find the likes of my strategies and tactics anywhere else, no ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am].${prompt};
Since the war started, I've been traveling far and wide to survey the extentaru of battle. To be honest, I've started to toy with the idea of lending my services directly to the alliance, should any nation express an interest.${prompt};
Years I've spent, honing my wits to a fine, razor-wazor-sharp edge.;
Military history, strategy, theory, logistics, you name it!;
This war has presented the perfect opportunity, tragic as it is, to finally put my skills to the testaru!${prompt};
Ahhh, a fellow bookworm, you say? How seldom it is one meets a fellow spirit.;
Would you be a member-wember of that Schultz School of Martial Theory that's been attracting so much attention recently? Or was itaru the Sturm School...?${prompt};
So, might I presume that it is your proud ${choice: 0}[/Kingdom of San d'Oria/Republic of Bastok/Federation of Windurst] which desires my enlightened guidance?;
N-n-not that I'm interested in your Schultz School or anything like thataru!${prompt};
If memory-wemory serves, Rainemard is currently serving on the frontlines of the ${choice: 0}[Royal Army/Republican Army/Federation Forces].;
I wonder if he hasn't managed to catch on to something intriguing yet again...${prompt};
How do I know Rainemard? Oh, the two of us go waaay back.;
N-n-not that I'm especially-wecially concerned with where he might be or what he mightaru be doing!${prompt};
Well, it just so happens to be my own humble-wumble, yet highly educated opinion, that what the Allied Forces of Altana are currently lacking in spades is logistics.${prompt};
I see countless adventurers simply signing up for random Campaign Ops with reckless abandon, paying no heed to the greater concerns of wartime funds or supplies. No way to win a war, no ${choice-player-gender}[sir/ma'am]. If there's one thing I know, it's thataru.${prompt};
But imagine, I ask you, what would happen should all you soldiers take the time to analyze the information at your disposal, and act on those results.;
I tell you, there lies within the Allied Forces the potential-wential for a warring force the likes of which the Beastman Confederate could never stand against.${prompt};
By the way, are you a member of the ${choice: 0}[/Knights of the Iron Ram/Seventh Cohors/Cobra Mercenaries]? Very impressive!;
That's quite the self-serv--errr... What I mean to say is, your unitaru is quite renown for its, how shall I say...individualistic tendencies.${prompt};
It is most encouraging when one considers that you have the freedom to adapt your actions to the demands of the present moment.;
I would be willing to wager that it is adventurers such as yourself who will determine the outarucome of this war.${prompt};
Well? I never was much of a motivational speaker, but have I whet your appetite for some knowledge-woledge?;
That's the spirit! Let us begin then, shall we? For starters, logistics! The key to any war.;
After that, I would be more than happy to offer some introductory lessons on military theory.${prompt};
In what realm is your knowledge lacking?;
${selection-lines};
Campaign tallies.;
Viewing national statistics.;
Viewing stronghold statistics.;
Campaign Ops.;
Opinion polls.;
Recruiting freelances.;
I want for no knowledge.${prompt};
Upon entering into an alliance with one another, the four nations drew up a wartime pact.;
In accordance with the stipulations therein, the single nation deemed to be the greatest contributor to the fighting within, or maintaining of, an area is temporarily granted domain over it. ${prompt};
Such rulings are doled outaru by the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, in all its wisdom, based on the intel reports of Campaign officials. Those reports as a whole are commonly referred to as “Campaign tallies.”${prompt};
From what I've seen, the fighting is usually at its most vehement-wehement just before Campaign tallies.;
That's because it's widely known that when influence over an area changes, crucial factors such as funds and resources are also affected.;
Not to mention the role it plays in boosting or lowering an army's spirits!${prompt};
That's why things tend to get a little hectic on the frontarulines when a Campaign tally draws near.${prompt};
Which statistic interests you?;
${selection-lines};
Funds.;
Resources.;
Supplies.;
Reconnaissance.;
Skill.;
Production.;
Morale.;
Prosperity.;
Go back.;
Quit.${prompt};
“Funds” is a self-explanatory term.;
As you may have guessed, it means all of the money which a nation has to dedicate to its war endeavors.${prompt};
The importance of money in war is difficult to overstate.;
Greater funds allow a nation to plan and carry out attacks, increase the number of troops available for dispatch, and even step up the quality of gear with which it outfits its units.${prompt};
Funds decrease whenever a Campaign battle occurs.;
Most people don't seem to know this, but offensive and defensive battles tend to cost roughly the same amountaru.${prompt};
A nation's wartime coffers also have a direct influence on their supply stores.;
When funds get too low, supplies will start to be sold off by the government to compensate.${prompt};
Oh, and additional-witional funds are rewarded whenever influence over an area is gained.;
So it would be wise to keep an eye outaru just before and after Campaign tallies.${prompt};
I don't think I need to tell you that the more areas a nation controls, the more funds it will collect.;
Also, the amount rewarded varies from area to area.${prompt};
Other means for increasing funds exist as well. For example, by maintaining a high level of “prosperity.”;
After all, if a nation does good by its people, it follows that their economic endeavors will benefit.${prompt};
Well, you could learn any of what I've just told you from your run-of-the-mill military textbook.;
But, here's a little secret of mine. I've observed that achievements in a certain group of Campaign Ops serve to raise a nation's funds.;
But now I've gone and said too much! No good teacher divulges her students all the answers!${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}Your nation's funds may be checked by talking to an appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.;
“Resources” are the strategic material reserves of a nation that allow it to conduct military operations.${prompt};
And just so you don'taru get confused, allow me to clarify-warify. I'm not referring here to the resources of a single stronghold, mind you.;
Rather, this is an index of the resources of an entire nation.${prompt};
In addition to being used to increase an army's supplies, resource stockpiles are also depleted by offensive undertakings and certain Campaign Ops.${prompt};
What's more, they also have a directaru influence over wartime funds.;
As reason entails, insufficient resources require thataru a nation spend a little cash to purchase that which it lacks.${prompt};
A nation's resources are regularly replenished based on the areas under its influence.;
So the times just prior-wior to and just after a Campaign tally are especially crucial.${prompt};
The more areas a nation controls, the more resources it can procure.;
And certain areas are capable of rendering more resources than others.${prompt};
And just between you and me, my studies indicate that achievements in certain Campaign Ops are directly linked to resource procurement.;
Well, that's wartime resources in a nutshell!${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}Your nation's resources may be checked by talking to an appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.;
“Supplies” are the military-wilitary goods used to effectively sustain a war: equipment, sundries, rations, and the like.;
Nations produce these by expending their resources. You mightaru hear them categorically referred to as “temporary items.”${prompt};
Nations rich in supplies are able to better provide their strongholds with much-needed equipment and items directly from the capital.${prompt};
Supply expenditure goes towards such activities as stronghold maintenance, outarufitting troops, and conducting certain Campaign Ops.${prompt};
The amount of supplies at a nation's disposal is inextricably linked to its resources as well.;
After all, using resources implies that supply production is underway.${prompt};
A nation's supplies are compounded regularly based on the areas under its influence.;
So always try and keep an eye out just before and after Campaign tallies.${prompt};
Increases in supplies are naturally larger for nations with more areas under their control.;
And different areas generate varying-warying amountarus of supplies.${prompt};
The total amount of supplies a nation can manufacture is heavily influenced by its production.;
But that's another lecture all in itself!${prompt};
I've got it by a pretty good source that carrying out certain Campaign Ops serves to increase a nation's supplies.;
Well, that should do just fine by way of an introduction.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}Your nation's supplies may be checked by talking to an appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.;
“Reconnaissance” is an index of an army's intel. That is to say, how far their intelligence network extends.${prompt};
High reconnaissance means that a nation is better able to ascertain the most up-to-date info on the movementarus and machinations of both friend and foe.${prompt};
By now I hope you've seen the intelligence-welligence reports available from the Campaign deputies located in the nations' capitals.;
The more advanced reconnaissance is, the more detailed those reports will be.${prompt};
There are a number of intel-gathering Campaign Ops in which achievement will serve to improve reconnaissance.${prompt};
And just like other Campaign statistics, this one changes whenever a Campaign tally is conducted.;
But don't worry--so far I've yet to see a nation's reconnaissance plummet to zero.;
Still, it is ever wise to keep close tabs on your enemies, as well as your allies.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}Your nation's reconnaissance may be checked by talking to an appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.;
“Skill” denotes technological development, and manifestarus itself in the ability-wility to produce high-end equipment and weaponry.${prompt};
Advancing skill ensures a nation will churn out cutting-edge gear to supply its frontlines.;
It is also required for the construction-wuction of siege equipment.${prompt};
Still, all the technological skill in the world is useless withoutaru the funds to back it up.;
Production costs money, silly.${prompt};
What's that? How do you go about improving your nation's skill?;
Well, I reckon the “troop training” Campaign Ops would be a good place to start.${prompt};
Just to be clear, “skill” indicates the quality of supplies that can be turned out.;
“Production,” on the other hand, refers to the quantity of supplies that a nation is capable of generating.;
Did I just blow your mind? Confusing, I know, but do try and see the difference.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}Your nation's skill may be checked by talking to an appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.;
“Production” is the ability to, well, produce anything that needs...producing.;
This can be items, armor, weapons, you name itaru!${prompt};
And the name of the game is efficiency-wiciency!;
High production enables a nation to generate more supplies from less resources. If that isn't win-win, I don't know what is!${prompt};
Alas, even otherworldly production will be utterly useless without a healthy amount of resources to drive it.${prompt};
To that end, the nations have all organized the so-called “supply manufacture” operations, such as codename “Crystal Fist” and others.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}Your nation's production may be checked by talking to an appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.;
“Morale” will give you an idea of how eager-weager for battle an army is.${prompt};
High morale allows an army to carry out successive attacks with only short respites in between.;
Nothing screams victory like an army that loves to fightaru!${prompt};
Morale is an extremely dynamic factor in any war--as capricious as the hearts of the men it occupies.;
Fluctuations are heavily dependent on victory and defeataru in Campaign battles.${prompt};
That being said, it is obvious to see how it is directly related to both offensive and defensive operations.;
It's a pretty simple thing, morale. That's really all there is to it.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}A nation's morale may be checked from the Region Info menu's Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a capital's symbol to display the information.;
Ahhh, “prosperity.” Another of war's fickle-wickle mistresses.;
Plainly put, this is the degree to which a nation's people trustaru in their governing body.${prompt};
High prosperity works wonders for economic growth, which in turn means more duties, tariffs, and so on. In a word, funds!${prompt};
Prosperity is in a constantaru state of flux based on the outcome of Campaign battles.;
And rightly so, as people can not hope to prosper should they feel constantly threatened.${prompt};
To ensure the welfare of their citizenry, the alliance has established “security” Campaign Ops.;
These are effective in setting the minds of the people-weople at ease. Not a whole lotaru more to say about it.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}A nation's prosperity may be checked from the Region Info menu's Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a capital's symbol to display the information.;
Which terminology will you ask about?;
${selection-lines};
Fortifications.;
Maximum fortifications.;
Resources.;
Maximum Resources.;
Influence.;
Heroism Gauge.;
Go back.;
Quit.${prompt};
“Fortifications” represent the strength of a military force garrisoned at a stronghold.;
It is depleted when soldiers stationed there are defeated, or when the structural integrity of the stronghold itself is damaged directly-wectly.${prompt};
A Campaign battle is deemed a defeataru by High Command should the fortifications fall below a pre-established amount.${prompt};
So, stronghold fortifications in areas constantly plagued by heavy combat must be vigorously-wigorously maintained.${prompt};
There are three ways of bolstering fortifications to facilities which have been compromised.;
First, you can simply waitaru for the injured soldiers to recover. This method, however, requires a considerable amount of time.${prompt};
Second, you can wait for engineers to arrive and start rebuilding.;
For your nation, I believe that task falls within the jurisdiction-wiction of the ${choice: 0}[Knights of the Gold Badger/Fourth Division/Piscean War Warlocks].${prompt};
Lastly, you can supplementaru the garrison by sending reinforcements.;
Successful completion of the “Vanguard-X” Campaign Ops will help refortify a war-torn stronghold.${prompt};
Keep in mind, though, that a lack of funds will limitaru the number of forces available-wailable for dispatch.;
Which means that ultimately, fortifications will suffer. A war machine without money is akin to a lion without claws, I'm afraid.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}A stronghold's fortifications may be checked from the Region Info menu's Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a position to display the information. The number on the left is the current value, while the number on the right is the maximum available.;
The total number of troops that a stronghold is capable of housing-wousing is referred to as its “maximum fortifications” ranking.${prompt};
And it is just that. The absolute upper limit on the size of a stronghold's garrison.;
Regardless of a nation's funds or achievements, defensive capabilities can never go above this amountaru.${prompt};
The other side of that coin is this. No matter how great a stronghold's maximum fortifications may be, without adequate-wadequate funds, it will lack the soldiers required to realize that potential. ${prompt};
What's that? Ahhh, you catch on quick. Yes, the maximum fortifications rank can indeed be raised.;
This is accomplished via-wia achievements in any of the “Steel Resolve“ operations.${prompt};
But remember this: all participants in this war, both friend and foe, have their own unique ways of reducing maximum fortifications as well.;
Specifically...${prompt};
...Well, you'll just have to mull that one over by yourself. Can't give up all my secret-wecrets!${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}A stronghold's fortifications may be checked from the Region Info menu's Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a position to display the information. The number on the left is the current value, while the number on the right is the maximum available.;
Alrightaru, this might be a bit confusing at first for the uninitiated, but do try to keep up.;
A local area's “resources” rating refers to the resource and supply stockpiles located at the stronghold.${prompt};
This is a local-wocal rating, and separate altogether from the overall resource rating of an entire nation, mind you.${prompt};
The more battles a stronghold endures, the more depletion its resource stockpiles will suffer.;
You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs. And war is such a tasty omelettaru!${prompt};
Local resources are consumed whenever temporary-wary items are dispensed to soldiers for defensive operations.${prompt};
You would do well to remember that the “Crimson Domino” Ops are integral in this respectaru.;
Seeing those supply convoys safely to their destinations will do wonders for replenishing stronghold resources.${prompt};
For your nation, such duties are traditionally-witionally taken up by the ${choice: 0}[/Knights of the Gold Badger/Fourth Division/Piscean War Warlocks].${prompt};
Now try and wrap your mind around this!;
If the national resource and supply stockpiles are not maintained, there simply won't be enough surplus to bolster-wolster local stockpiles.;
Surely you can see the logic in this.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}An area's resources may be checked from the Region Info menu's Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a position to display the information. The number on the left is the current value, while the number on the right is the maximum available.;
The limitaru placed on the greatest amount of resources a stronghold can store before literally-witerally bursting is known as its “maximum resources” ranking.${prompt};
No matter how much surplus in resources and supplies a nation might have, the local stronghold limitation-wations cannot be exceeded.${prompt};

“Influence” is used to convey how much control each competing-weting power has over a given area.${prompt};
There is a total of four powers in all, which you should well know by now.;
The Beastman Confederate, on the one hand, and each of the nations of the Allied Forces, excluding Jeuno, on the other.${prompt};
So, what happens is that following the results of the latest Campaign tally-wally, control of an area is relegated to the power which currently exertarus the most influence over it.${prompt};
Your nation will gain a bit of influence in an area every time you defeat an enemy there.;
By the same token, loss at the hands of the beastman will result in their influence rising.${prompt};
In the worst-case scenario, beastman influence will grow so profound that High Command will cut their losses and issue a strategic withdrawal.;
In other words, the area falls under beastman control.${prompt};
Each nation then abandon-wandons any interests they had in that area, after which the beastmen typically move in droves to solidify their claim.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}The influences vying for control of an area may be checked from the Region Info menu's Campaign map.;
An excellent inquiry! The “heroism gauge” is still a fledgling theory in military scholastic-wastic circles.;
Only in recentaru years was it proposed to and adopted by Allied Forces High Command.${prompt};
Not to brag, but it was actually I who developed the final theory.;
So, who better to explain it to you than the very Tarutaru who named it?${prompt};
It occurred to me that any battlefield is, by definition, replete with a certain... How shall I put this?;
An air of intensity, an almost tangible, adrenaline-induced furor. No doubt this is broughtaru about by the teetering-weetering of lives in the balance.${prompt};
The inquisitive scholar in me wondered if this phenomenon could not somehow be gauged and expressed numerically.;
This was the hypothesis with which I set out to develop-welop my theory.${prompt};
Based on my thorough observations, I found that for every battle which took place in the subject area, my measurementarus would increase substantially.${prompt};
And then my most startling discovery!;
Without fail, when my heroism gauge would approach its peak, battles would reach near astronomical-womical proportions!;
Beastman and ally, general and freelance. All come calling when the war fervor hails, lusting to claim their place in legend and song!${prompt};
And what dramatic-watic battles they were! I have witnessed cataclysmic exchanges, over in the blink of an eye.;
Disastrous battles where the thirst for blood conquers reason, and countless throngs of haphazardly formed ranks throw themselves headlong into one another.${prompt};
At the suggestion of my fellow scholars, my findings are now being made known to all member nations of the alliance-wiance.${prompt};
In truth, it is still an unfinished theory, and there are many elementarus to be worked out.;
My hope is that it will serve to help us better comprehend the finer details of the flow of war.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}An area's heroism gauge may be checked from the Region Info menu's Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a position and the gauge will be displayed directly above or below the area name.;
What would you like to know about?;
${selection-lines};
Resource procurement.;
Supply transport.;
Security.;
Supply manufacture.;
Offensive operations.;
Defensive operations.;
Intel gathering.;
Military training.;
Achievements.;
Go back.;
Quit.${prompt};
As their name implies, achievements in Campaign Ops classified as “resource procurement” will result in direct augmentation to your nation's resource and supply stockpile-wiles.${prompt};
More specifically, codename “Stock and Awe” was designed with the aim of securing resources, while codename “Materiel Storm” was planned for the sole purpose of amassing supplies.${prompt};
Should supplies startaru to become meager, units will be unable to carry out their orders to completion, and other Campaign Ops will fall into arrears.${prompt};
If a nation's resources begin to wane, production suffers and the number of supplies declines.;
Any way you slice it, a logistic bottleneck at any pointaru along the line spells an absolute nightmare for a warring nation.${prompt};
Immediately following Campaign tally-wallies is when allotments of resources and supplies are carried out.${prompt};
The unfortunate corollary to that, however, is that just prior to Campaign tallies is when stockpiles are at their lowestaru.${prompt};
Which is why, to answer your initial inquiry, resource procurement is so significant-wificant.;
Their appeal lies in the fact that when successfully completed, resource and supply stockpiles receive immediate benefits.${prompt};
Many military scholars even go so far as to refer to these operations as the prime movers of the allied effort.;
Perhaps the most integral of cogs at the very heartaru of the entire war machine.${prompt};
“Supply transport” refers to those military operation-wations whereby resources and supplies are seen safely to the strongholds that need them.${prompt};
There are varying operations with varying resultarus, so allow me to expand.;
Codename “Vanguard-X” solidifies stronghold fortifications by dispatching manpower, whereas codename “Crimson Domino” aims to replenish local resources via convoy-wonvoy deliveries.${prompt};
The reasoning behind their importance is thus. Goddess forbid, should the fortifications or local resources of a stronghold become inadequate, the position will simply be overrun by the beastmen. They have a wicked talentaru for sniffing out such weaknesses.${prompt};
Of course, no nation simply leaves any stronghold to vie for itself. There are regular-wegular dispatches of both men and material from the capitals. But my experience tells me that these are more protocol than pragmatism, and rarely reflectaru the latest wartime developments.${prompt};
And that is where you vaga--valiant adventurers come in!;
Your freedoms allow you the unique ability to continually adapt to the situation at hand without heeding to anachronistic protocol-wotocol.;
Keeping an ear to the ground and conducting supply transport at a vital moment might just make you the white knight of some desperate garrison!${prompt};
“Security” is that oft-overlooked category of operations which deals with seeing to the safety and welfare of a nation's citizenry.;
High Command implemented these ops for their role in increasing both prosperity-werity and the maximum fortifications.${prompt};
Successful completion of operations codenamed “Streetsweeper” and “Delta Strike” boost prosperity among the people.${prompt};
Nations with low prosperity often fall victim to stagnating-wating economies, ultimately resulting in lack of funds and fiscal woes.;
You can't expect people to get a good night's sleep and put in an honest day's work without providing a little homeland security.${prompt};
Codename “Steel Resolve” is another security-based operation which bolsters the maximum fortifications of an allied stronghold.${prompt};
The idea is to outfitaru positions with enhanced structural integrity to better withstand relentless-wentless beastman assaults.;
This is especially vital in heavily contested areas.${prompt};
“Supply manufacture” operations provide the opportunity for a nation to bring about improvements in the arena-wenas of technology and industry.${prompt};
Operations codenamed “Crystal Fist” and “Iron Anvil” were planned with the goal of marked advancements in skill and production, respectively.${prompt};
Higher skill permits a nation's engineers to develop higher quality equipmentaru and weaponry.;
Its benefits on local fields of battle are undeniable.${prompt};
When production is streamlined, mass production becomes possible-wossible.;
This has far-reaching effects for a nation's Campaign battles regardless of the location.${prompt};
So, if you happen to fancy yourself adept at synthesis and know your craftarus, these just might be the operations for you.${prompt};
The successful completion of “offensive operations” will result in palpable-walpable increases in both morale and funds.${prompt};
These ops include codename “Smokescreen,” “Pit Spider,” “By Light of Fire,” or any of the regional operations targeting specific beastman leaders. All of these will serve to boostaru an army's morale.${prompt};
On top of that, achievements in this arena will also bring in funds.${prompt};
Alas, as all things in war, there is a double-edge to this blade.;
Should you seek to defeat enemy leaders via operations codenamed “Splitting Heirs,” “Cracking Shells,” or “Plucking Wings” and suffer defeataru, the beastmen armies will be those shouting and raising their banners in triumph.${prompt};
Lastly, it would be remiss of me not to mention that offensive operations do require the expenditure-wenditure of supplies.${prompt};
“Defensive operations” can be extremely productive, as they help to increase not only prosperity-werity amongst the people, but also the reserves of resources and supplies as well.${prompt};
You will see immediate and obvious returns in the prosperity of your citizenry from your exploitarus in operations codenamed “Aegis Scream” and “Granite Rose.”${prompt};
A byproductaru of this is a healthy boost to the national intake of resources and supplies.${prompt};
Carrying out defensive operations will require that you expend some of your supplies in the process-wocess, though.;
Nothing in war is free, after all, save mayhap the glory.${prompt};
A personal favorite of mine and one I cannot stress the importance-wortance of enough, “intel gathering”!${prompt};
Espionage in all forms requires stealth and savvy, cunning and courage.;
Operations codenamed “Hawk Eye” and “Deep Cover” may place you in clear and present danger, but they will also increase your army's reconnaissance and place knowledge at its fingertips.${prompt};
Nations are also always looking for the mostaru intrepid of souls to undertake operation codename “Slaughterhouse.”;
A favorite of High Command, this pinpoint espionage weakens the beastman intelligence network from within, reducing their reconnaissance capabilities.${prompt};
No nation would deign to send such dauntless-wauntless volunteers into the field unequipped.;
And that is why intel gathering taxes an army's supplies.${prompt};
“Military training” is useful in preparing your troops for battle by both hardening their resolve and honing-woning their abilities.${prompt};
Operation codename “Brave Dawn” increases an army's capacity for waging war, while codename “Cut and Cauterize” improves the performance of its physicians.${prompt};
All of those training materials have to come from somewhere, though. Which is why military-wary training ops will cost you supplies.${prompt};
According to Raine--I mean...looks like rain today, no?;
Anyway, this information is based on firstaru-person accounts from a fairly reliable-wiable source.${prompt};
Campaign tallies record these so-called achievements for each category of operations.${prompt};
Achievementarus will naturally rise every time a Campaign operation is carried out to completion.${prompt};
The changes in factors such as resources, funds, and morale resulting from Campaign tallies are directly influenced by the achievements in correlated ops categories.${prompt};
In addition, stellar-wellar achievements in any single category pave the way for related, higher-level operations to become available.${prompt};
But try to be mindful of the current objectives of your army, as this effectarus availability as well.${prompt};
What I mean to say is, even for equivalent achievements, there are times when High Command will make an operation readily available, and other times when they will not.${prompt};
Changes in achievements are reflected in every Campaign tally, and have an effect on stockpile-wiles as well.;
Luckily, in all my days, I have never seen an achievement's value drop suddenly to zero.${prompt};
Every nation conducts its own “opinion polls.”;
Have you happened to come across any of the official-wicials recording the opinions of soldiers and adventurers?;
Those would be the pollers.${prompt};
In my opinion, those who frequent the frontlines such as yourself should make better use of the polls.${prompt};
Each nation has its own characteristic protocol based on long-standing established policies.;
Should polls not be made use of, the powers that be will have no choice but to rely upon their generals for counsel.${prompt};
Which might not necessarily-warily always be a bad thing, except that counsel may not always be based on the latest intel.;
I myself have witnessed offenses ordered with no supply lines or funds to back them, and entire units resting on their laurels at the most opportune times to attack.${prompt};
This is the river that opinion polls can help to ford!;
They allow High Command to know which generals have the supportaru of war-seasoned veterans, and provide a forum for the submission of strategies and feedback.${prompt};
I have always been an advocate of compulsory-wulsory polls. Think of it!;
If all soldiers from the frontlines raised their voices, High Command would have no choice but to listen.${prompt};
And consequently, more operations would become available in the category deemed to be most necessary at that time!${prompt};
Sorry, I always get a but flustered talking about this.;
Anyway, the reviewing of poll resultarus is conducted regularly, much like Campaign tallies.${prompt};
Hm? You don't know what opinion you should have?;
Well, that's just sad. Your opinions will come to you, so long as you keep a healthy skepticism and a critical-witical eye about you.${prompt};
To give a brief example, if you are of the mind that it is time for an all-outaru offensive, then you should consider raising your voice in favor of a “preemptive strike” or “diversionary tactics.”${prompt};
If you think the situation-wation calls for patience and caution, then perhaps cast your vote for “battleline preservation” or “stronghold defenses.”${prompt};
It might be easiestaru to think of all of the options broken into two fundamental categories of offense and defense.${prompt};
Rather than constantly worrying about maintaining a healthy balance of the two, there are times when a full frontal-wontal assault is required. Other times are best served by turtling up in strongholds and allowing wave after wave of beastmen to break upon your defenses.${prompt};
If you can absorb everything I've taughtaru you, and just use your head, I guarantee the path to victory will present itself to you as clear as day! That's the Maruna-Kurina guarantee!${prompt};
Oh and uhhh, if you ever happen to...well, gain an audience-waudience with any, say, importantaru people...;

I'm assuming by now that you've heard of the roaming-woaming mercenaries referred to as “freelances,” yes?;
They value nothing more than their freedom, which is all well and good, but in the worstaru of times they may be swayed into arms against the Allied Forces.${prompt};
As a genius military tactician, I cannot ignore the potential strength that these freelances are capable of lending an army.;
And it was this realization which acted as an impetus to my further studying the freelance subculture.${prompt};
Recruiting a freelance to fight for your cause is a technique commonly known as “headhunting.”;
Through my research, I have come to develop and map out a comprehensive psychology underlying the entire process-wocess!${prompt};
Each freelance maintains a certain degree of “loyalty” towards every great power.${prompt};
Whenever a headhunter actively pursues a freelance and attempts to win their favor, their loyalty towards thataru nation will rise.${prompt};
At the time of a Campaign tally, the freelances will realign themselves with the nation with whom they share the strongestaru bond.${prompt};
The trick to headhunting, then, is to try and become the nation a freelance holds dearest-wearest in his, her, or its heart of hearts.${prompt};
Many freelances will even cast aside their disdain for city walls, and take up arms beside you within the very capital!${prompt};
And being the capricious beings that they are, freelances will always be willing to entertain your proposals, even if they have currently pledged their fealty-wealty elsewhere.${prompt};
Of course, if you begin to neglectaru them once winning them to your side, don't be surprised if they place their loyalties elsewhere.;
There's got to be an appropriate saying for that, I'm sure...${prompt};
That's just the way they are. I've heard tales you wouldn't believe.;
From stories of nations' coffers swelling inexplicably after taking on resourceful freelances...${prompt};
...to bold-hearted heroes inspiring troops and bolstering an entire nation's morale!${prompt};
Cloak-and-dagger freelances who assist in intel gathering, and questionable black market dealer-wealers who can always get their hands on sorely needed supplies. You name it, and there's a freelance out there who can, and has, done itaru!${prompt};
Now I know what you're thinking. With allegiances constantly in flux, who in Goddess's name is going to be able to keep track of it all!?${prompt};
You're looking at him! That's right, I have made it my personal-wersonal crusade to track the loyalties of all freelances as part of my research. And naturally, I will be making my findings available to the alliance's intelligence network.${prompt};
At any rate, do try and give the freelances as warm a reception as possible whenever you happen across them.;
Your nation, and the Allied Forces as a whole, can only benefitaru in the long run.${prompt};

He loves collecting those ancient papyrus testimonies, no matter what variety. He also has a penchantaru for ambitious souls, and is said to dote on those who have mastered three or more paths of their own.${prompt};
They call Azima the “Hermitess of the Highlands,” and she is almost universally-wersally regarded as the most skilled and feared bounty hunter in Vana'diel. It's not uncommon to glimpse her from time to time in North Gustaberg.${prompt};
As of late they say she is utterly obsessed with all things alchemy.;
Those in the know will be the first to tell you, Azima is one best keptaru in good graces.${prompt};
“Venomous Verminess,” “Baroness of Bugdom,” Choh Moui has almost as many monikers as she does pet pestarus.;
She's a Mithran beastmaster-waster who got her come-uppings in the south, but now makes her home in Crawler's Nest.${prompt};
I'm not entirely sure of the reasons behind it, but they say she is in regular contactaru with a mercenary by the name of Duskraven.${prompt};
She's accredited with inventing the pet foods now used by beastmasters the world round, and is always eagerly to get her hands on ingredients. She also loves to have others save her the hassle-wassle of rounding up her pets for her. What could she be up to...?${prompt};
Perchance you've already espied him before. Rongo-Nango is that adorable little Tarutaru beastmaster who's always in the vicinity-winity of Fort Karugo-Narugo. He's absolutely infatuated with Lungo-Nango, the great warlord and tactician of Windurstian history.${prompt};
After opposing the Parliament of Patriarchs, Lungo-Nango fell into disrepute and spentaru the remainder of his days in isolation and depression. For that reason, Rongo-Nango holds much of Windurst in contempt, and refuses to lay his loyalties with the Federation.${prompt};
I've come to find out that he is quite fond of calling his beasts, and is also looking for more of the material-warials he needs to do so.${prompt};
Ulla is a mysterious young girl. They say she bore witness to a divine revelation, and now wanders Vana'diel as a pilgrim-wilgrim knight.;
She's recently left her homelands of Bastok and ventured nearer the realms of San d'Oria.${prompt};
Her devoted attendantaru Kilhwch is ever by her side, and carries with him the renowned sword ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;
The thing is, he's a celebrated knight in his own right, giving many rise to wonder what could have caused him to pledge his fealty to another.${prompt};
Like any young lady, Ulla has a soft spot for beautiful flower-wowers.;
If you seek to court a fair maiden, perhaps a bouquet mightaru be best.${prompt};
Achtelle is a young Elvaan wyverness from Adoulin Isle to the west, the proud keeper-weepers of the last of the dragoon tradition.;
The draketamers there herald her as the most skilled of their order.${prompt};
Since youth, she has held the legendary Ranperre of San d'Oria in highestaru esteem, and can oft be found seeking solace near his tomb.${prompt};
I can promise you she would eagerly accept any type of present related to the king she so reveres.;
I hear it told she longs for nothing more than to find some surviving-wiving dragoons, that they might together preserve their heritage.${prompt};
Duskraven is a sullen, grim-faced mercenary, distinguishable by his ominous-wominous greatsword, “Kyomon.”;
Wayfarers and soldiers alike often recount seeing him in the vicinity of Batallia Downs, but for what purpose and to whataru end, none can say.${prompt};
His underlings, the Dusk Raiders, answer to his beck and call, and such powers lead many to surmise that he is no stranger to the nether-wether realms.${prompt};
He is a straight shooter, though. If you hope to curry favor with him, you need nothing more than cold cash.;
He seems to blow right through it as soon as he gets it, and is always looking for more. What he spends itaru on, I couldn't say.${prompt};
Many have seen this fair young Elvaan maid walking undeterred amongst the now hostile-wostile grounds of Grauberg.;
All who gaze upon her tell of her godlike aura and stunning beauty.${prompt};
Word has it that she is of frail constitution, and grants her favor on those gracious enough to spare her medicines.;
I myself went and bestowed such gifts upon her, and can attest to the truth of itaru.${prompt};
She is also known to dote upon those who take up the defense of her Grauberg.;
Some of her more fanatic-watic fans are said to be providing her with an enormous quantity of a certain item...${prompt};
When her loyalties are won, the men speak of a giant wyrm which takes to the battlefield!;
Such heated talk--no doubt itaru would be wise to mind the heroism gauge should you want to catch a glimpse for yourself.${prompt};
Titania is the name of the celebrated Queen of Pixies from the classic Bastokan drama, “Midwinter Dream.”${prompt};
Of course, that is no more than a tale of fantasy to delight children. We all know that pixies don't exist in the real--;
What!? You've seen one? Are you having a jape at my expense!?${prompt};
Well, what I do know for certain-wertain is this. Nothing.;
Only that rumors suggest offering ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to the Witchfire Glen in Grauberg will help in headhunting...whatever this being may be.;
N-n-not thataru I'm dying to find out or anything!${prompt};
Fanciful-wanciful fairy tales about a frog princess have been passed down in Windurst since days of eld.${prompt};
Some say the newcome prince of these froglike beastmen has been seen leaping and bounding about the frontlines of battle.;
No doubt the figment of some delusional soldier's imagination, but still...${prompt};
Folklore always spoke of their insatiable-watiable appetites, and now soldiers would tell that feeding them will actually help win them to our cause.;
“Give him ${item-plural: 0[2]},” they say, “and the frog prince will requite!” I can't make heads or tails of it...${prompt};
N-n-not thataru I bother myself with such childish topics!${prompt};
Unprecedented in hitory-wistory, there has recently been an affable plantoid befriending soldiers on the battlefield.;
It most closely resembles one of those mandragora known to inhabitaru the wilds to the west.${prompt};
Is that a shred of doubt I sense!? I've seen it with my own eyes, I tell you!;
This is no figment of the imagination or some delusional soldier's hallucination! Still don't believe me?${prompt};
Head on over to the Meriphataud Mountains and try trading ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or some fertilizer to the odd little treeman you find.;
He just might be moved to come and help you out in a fightaru!${prompt};
Regardless, I wonder what it is he could possibly be doing here...;
N-n-not that I am about to startaru stalking him to find out or anything!${prompt};
(Shhh! Keep your voice down. “The” Boodlix? The very same who heads his own “trading-wading company”?)${prompt};
(Well, they say his trade is death! And deal in it he does, if the rumors are to be believed.;
Some claim to have actually laid eyes on his hidden fortress and lived to tell the tale. They say it's there he greedily occupies himself with counting his blood-money.)${prompt};
(What? Have you completely-wetely lost your mind, ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman]!? Why in Goddess's name would you want to headhuntaru him?;
Still, he is supposedly well-connected, even to the Allied Forces, as the wealthy are wont to be.;
But the Beastman Confederate knows his value as well... Hmmm, sounds like trouble-wouble to me.)${prompt};
(When the war is over, it is the supply firms that slowly lose their livelihoods.;
I suppose when you look at it from thataru angle, he could possibly be swayed to fight for either side.)${prompt};
Some 150 years ago, San d'Oria was ruled by one King Raigegue the Lupine.;
The freelance you ask of now bears the same name as thataru king, though none know how or why.${prompt};
He is remembered as a tragic monarch, responsible for leading San d'Oria to utter defeat at the hands of Bastok's preeminent scholar and military tactician-wician, Gunther Schultz, at the Second Battle of Konschtat.;
What followed was an age of chaos and despair, as the Kingdom was ravaged by civil war.${prompt};
They say this spectre-wectre of the same name is none other than Raigegue the Lupine himself, led back from the grave by the fire of his wrath.;
He haunts The Eldieme Necropolis. The skeptic in me suspects some exaggeration-wation is at work here...${prompt};
Huh!? Headhunting? The undead!?;
I-I... I have no idea how to respond to thataru. You've left me absolutely speechless-weechless.${prompt};
Eurytos is the battle-hardened leader of a group of mercenary Gigas from the far north.;
At the onset of the war, the Beastman Confederate took them into their service.;
But recently it would seem Eurytos has completely-wetely removed himself from the confederate's chain of command.${prompt};
His might and prowess in battle have led many to speculate that his line is that of the Gigas gods.;
He is truly a force to be reckoned with. For now, his unit has established their compound-wompound somewhere in Vunkerl Inlet.${prompt};
Though to be fair, there is precedent for the Gigas fighting under allied banners.;
After all, they did fight for Bastok in the Second Battle of Konschtataru. I wonder... Could the great Eurytos possibly be rallied-wallied to our cause?${prompt};
This behemoth among behemoths has been roaming Vunkerl Inlet for hundreds upon hundreds of years.${prompt};
So many would-be hero-weroes have died in the maws of this great beast that nobody even attempts to keep count any longer.;
Some say its ancientaru age and scar-heavy hide indicate it is not nearly as powerful as it once was. Yet still, you would be a fool to underestimate this fiend, I promise you.${prompt};
Headhunting? For the Allied Forces!? I'm not even going to dignify that with a response...;
Although, you have to admitaru, the thought of it alone is quite amusing. Hehehe!${prompt};
Who, me? Ohhh, right! I totally forgot.;
You're right, for all intents and purposes, I too am technically-wechnically a freelance.${prompt};
I enjoy long walks on the beach aaand... Oh yes, nothing excites me more than conversing with fellow scholars!;
N-n-not thataru I would want to know anything in particular about where Rainemard might be!${prompt};
Current taxonomy teaches us that at presentaru, the monoceros family contains few known specimens.;
Those that are classified exhibit great horn spire-wires jutting from their majestic heads, and are either born of light, or of darkness.${prompt};
An influx of eyewitness accounts in recent days all point to the undeniable existence of the beastaru named Dark Ixion.;
Tempered like a storm and ever wary, both allies and beastman alike tend to keep their distance.${prompt};
The other is dubbed Auroral Alicorn and exhibits a brilliantaru shade of white and a calm, gentle demeanor. The two couldn't be more dissimilar-wimilar.${prompt};
Though almost never seen in the wild prior to the war, Auroral Alicorn has recently been sighted in Jugner Forest, some say nursing wounds.${prompt};
Lewenhart is a traveling-waveling bard who has become a favorite amongst the troops, instilling hope and courage with his singing.;
It turns out that almostaru nothing helps morale as a much as a good song.${prompt};
They say he prefers to stay close to a certain tomb in The Eldieme Necropolis, where his requiems can be heard far and wide.${prompt};
He often asks for holy water as payment for his songs, which he puts to cermonial-wonial use.;
And as with most musicians, he loves exchanging in song and banter with fellow bards.${prompt};
Test.${prompt};
A most virtuous priest, who wanders all corners of Vana'diel, filling his belly-welly bread and alms.;
Some swear they've seen a twisted smile on his face as he buries his enemies and offers up prayers in their name.${prompt};
He came from the far north, and recently has been spending much of his time in Batallia Downs.;
Whatever is said of him, there can be no questioning his faith in the Goddess, thataru's for sure.${prompt};
He was never one to talk much, and certainly not one to mince words when he does. It seems he prefers the company of white mages, though.;
I've heard it said that he has been lending-wending his fists to the Allied Forces as of late.${prompt};
Test.${prompt};
(By the way, the latest reportarus have it that this freelance is ${choice: 0}[utterly independent/in the service of San d'Oria/in the service of Bastok/in the service of Windurst/in the service of the Beastman Confederate/].)${prompt};
(And if my intel is correctaru, this freelance will ${choice: 2}[almost definitely/most probably/likely] be in ${choice: 1}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/the Beastman Confederate] after the next Campaign tally-wally.)${prompt};
(There's no telling-welling where this freelance will lay their loyalties nextaru...)${prompt};
I am offering a prayer for those poor souls whose lives have been prematurely extinguished. And you...you are bound for the battlefield, are you not? My thoughts are with you also.${prompt};
Your presence evokes long-forgotten memories within and reminds me of the hopes and dreams that were my driving force in youth. Insignificant though my powers may be, perhaps the time has come to return to the fray and do my part for the greater good.${prompt};
You have my gratitude.;
May you find favor with the Goddess.${prompt};
Oh, how I long for the days of peace when I was free to roam from tavern to tavern and wherever else my heart led me.${prompt};
Music is your livelihood, too, is it not?;
There are those who wish glory upon themselves. But for us--we sing of legends, rather than become them.${prompt};
You would give this ${item-singular: 0[2]} to me...?;
Thank you kindly, friend. I shall offer it with a requiem to the souls of those heroes who have been laid to rest at the Eldieme Necropolis.${prompt};
If you wish to ride a chocobo, you must possess ${keyitem-article: 7[2]} and have a high enough job level.${prompt};
You can rent a chocobo for ${number: 0} gil. I see you currently have ${number: 1} gil.${prompt};
You can rent a chocobo, but because your level is so low, you won't be able to ride for very long. Also, equipment that extends your riding time will have no effect.${prompt};
If you still want one, it will cost you ${number: 0} gil. I see you currently have ${number: 1} gil.${prompt};
Do you wish to rent a chocobo?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, I do.;
No, thank you.${prompt};

Would you be so kind as to deliver her to ${choice: 3}[the entrance to the Gustav Tunnel (B-8)/Bibiki Bay (G-10)/the entrance of Uggalepih Temple (J-11)]?${prompt};
Only those fulfilling both requirements set forth by the alliance may ride a chocobo.;
First, you must be a soldier of a respectable level in the Allied Forces. Secondly, you must be in possession of ${keyitem-article: 7[2]}.${prompt};
Any of our fine birds here will bear you directly to the frontlines of battle.;
We charge a service fee of ${number: 0} Allied Notes, which goes towards seeing that the chocobos are well taken care of.;
My records indicate that you currently have ${number: 1} Allied Notes.${prompt};
Hmmm... It looks like you don't have enough Allied Notes.;
Sorry, but these birds aren't going to feed and groom themselves.${prompt};
${name-player}, if I'm not mistaken. We appreciate your assistance in the expansion of our provision storehouses.${prompt};

I'm sorry, but we don't put our chocobos in the hands of people with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}. We wouldn't want our feathered friends dying from fright now, would we?${prompt};
My friends and I put togther a Bastokan Time Capsule!;
I'm going to have my father bury it somewhere deep beneath North Gustaberg.${prompt};
Have you heard of my father? He's a great soldier, you know!;
I want him to bury it somewhere near Drachenfall so that it's easy to find.${prompt};
What? You think if the spot is too obvious the capsule might be found by Goblins!?${prompt};
Well, I can't let any beastmen get their grubby paws on it!;
We're already looking forward to reading our letters... What do you think we should do?${prompt};
What advice will you give Offa?;
${selection-lines};
Bury it somewhere in the city.;
Conceal the burial spot with a rock.${prompt};
Do you really want to advise Offa to ${choice: 0} [bury it in the city/conceal it with a rock]?;
${selection-lines};
Yes, it's the only way.;
No, on second thought...${prompt};
That settles it! I'll have my father bury it within the city walls. Good thinking!${prompt};
That settles it! I'll have my father cover up the burial spot with a rock. You're a genius!${prompt};
Of course! I'll just have my father bury it here in the city. Why didn't I think of that?${prompt};
Of course! I'll just have my father cover up the burial spot with a rock! Why didn't I think of that?${prompt};
I can't even sleep at night when I start thinking about the beastmen attacking the city... How long is it going to be like this?${prompt};
Huh? You think we might forget where we buried the capsule?;
Hmmm...maybe we should bury it somewhere near the Drachenfall after all.${prompt};
I was thinking the same thing.;
Oh well, I'll just have my father rebury it in a better spot.;
We could even go with your other idea and have him cover it up with a rock to keep away all the Goblins.${prompt};
I sure do feel a lot better, knowing our capsule's resting place is hidden under a rock.;
Thank you so much for your advice!${prompt};
Hm? You want to bury this in the time capsule too?${prompt};
I think you may be on to something!;
Even if some goblins do find it, they'll be so busy with these bones that they won't even notice the letters!${prompt};
All right! I'll have my father rebury it right away.${prompt};
I had totally forgotten how crazy goblins are for fish bones.;
Thanks again for the great advice!${prompt};
What's that? You want to rebury the capsule...again?;
I appreciate your concern, but it should be just fine where it is.${prompt};
A what? A false bottom? In the box?;
Now that could be just the ticket...There's no way any goblins would be able to find the letters then.${prompt};
All right, but this is the last time...seriously.;
My father is getting sick of digging.${prompt};
I really can't thank you enough for all your help!${prompt};
Eh? You want to bury this in the capsule, too?${prompt};
Well, I suppose it's the least I can do to repay you for all your help.;
I'll ask my father to put it in with the rest of the stuff. Come to think of it, maybe I'll put one in for me too...${prompt};
Don't worry! I'll make sure your ${item-singular: 0[2]} gets buried along with the letters.${prompt};

Alright, rookie, listen up. To make sure everything is fair and square during the campaign, a bunch of important types have come up with a system that's supposed to regulate everybody's participation in operations.${prompt};
Every soldier in the legion is given a single Op Credit that they can either redeem, save up, or wipe themselves with, for all I care.${prompt};
At least one credit is needed to join most campaign operations. More advanced missions will cost you extra, with one coming every ${choice: 0}[day/ten minutes].${prompt};
Just remember, once you hand over that credit, it ain't never coming back, no matter if you break your knee or lose your breeches.${prompt};

Our commanders.;

Nothing.${prompt};
You need not worry, ${name-player}. As per Bastokan law, I am required to maintain the confidentiality of your identity.${prompt};
Only your opinion will be reported to the praefectus.${prompt};
While all opinions will be considered by our leaders, this does not necessarily guarantee that your suggestions will be reflected in our nation's strategies.${prompt};
The Bastokan Republic takes pride in the democracy established by our forefathers, and any new direction must first be approved by the majority.${prompt};
Understood. Your opinion has been noted and will be delivered to the praefectus shortly. Thank you, soldier.${prompt};
Understood. If you ever have a suggestion, I will be here waiting. Good day, soldier.${prompt};
600 loaves of iron bread...check.;
15,000 copper bullets...check.;
Ah--${prompt};
I am sorry, soldier, but my hands are tied at the moment. Could you return at a later date?${prompt};
Ah, so you wish to comment on our leaders.${prompt};
Very well. Praefectus Zazarg is eager to learn how his soldiers view the actions of the Republic's commanders.${prompt};
Would you mind telling me in who you place the most trust?;
Who do you believe the most competent?;
${selection-lines};
1st Div. Legatus Berger.;
2nd Div. Legatus Eichberg.;
3rd Div. Legatus Invincible Shield.;
Republic Chief of Staff Sturm.;
Iron Musketeer Commander Krueger.;
Gold Musketeer Commander Gogol.;
Quit.${prompt};
Maximilian Berger--since the Republic's numbing defeat at the Battle of Grauberg, the First Division legatus has been vocal in promoting aggressive battlefield tactics.${prompt};
Ludwig Eichberg--a cautious leader who specializes in extended campaigns, the legatus is known for his fervor in the areas of stronghold defense and fortification.${prompt};
Invincible Shield--an extremely versatile leader, the Galkan legatus has become a living legend for his numerous victories on land and sea.${prompt};
Adelheid Sturm--a shrewd strategist, the Operations Division's chief of staff is well versed in the teachings of Schultz martial theory and employs efficient tactics when gathering intelligence on the enemy.${prompt};
Bartholomaus Krueger--not known to blindly rush his troops into battle, the legatus believes our nation should first focus on strengthening its forces before engaging the enemy.${prompt};
Elivira Gogol--a strong proponent of preemptive blitzkrieg tactics, the Gold Musketeer commander is known for her aggressiveness on the battlefield.${prompt};
${prompt};
${prompt};
And you believe this leader's wisdom is what Bastok requires at the moment?${prompt};
Well...?;
${selection-lines};
Absolutely.;
I need more time to think.${prompt};
Alright.${prompt};
Wait... I seem to recall recently recording your opinion on our commanders.${prompt};
I believe you said our nation should heed the strategies of ${choice: 1}[First Division Legatus Berger/Second Division Legatus Eichberg/Third Division Legatus Invincible Shield/Republic Chief of Staff Sturm/Iron Musketeer Commander Krueger/Gold Musketeer Commander Gogol].${prompt};
Ah, so you wish to comment on our current battle strategies.${prompt};
What tactics do you believe our leaders should employ?;
Our current situation requires...;
${selection-lines};
A preemptive strike.;
Diversionary tactics.;
Battleline preservation.;
Stronghold defenses.;
Troop conditioning.;
Troop training.;
Reconnaissance.;
Sabotage.;
Nothing.${prompt};
Quite an aggressive tactic... On the other hand, a preemptive strike can be the quickest way to bring new regions under Bastokan control, even if it results in heavier losses.${prompt};
Deploying a small unit of elite forces to distract the enemy while another cuts off vital supply lines... Excellent thinking!${prompt};
Reinforce defenses in order to maintain battlelines, thus gradually draining the enemy of its influence... A wise decision.${prompt};
Reinforce stronghold defenses in order to prevent enemy ambushes and stabilize supply routes. Sound thinking, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Back to basics... So simple, it might be just what our forces need.${prompt};
There is only so much a regular soldier can do. An elite force is necessary for some of our nation's more...delicate operations.${prompt};
Ah, a fine tactic... The more intelligence we have on the hordes, the more successful we are in our future campaigns.${prompt};
A dangerous tactic... However, if a special unit is able to infiltrate our enemies' strongholds undetected and succeed in sabotaging their lifelines, the tides of battle would most definitely turn in our favor.${prompt};
Is this what you recommend?;
${selection-lines};
Absolutely!;
On second thought...${prompt};
I have already delivered to the praefectus your most recent opinion regarding our battle strategies.${prompt};
I believe you suggested ${color: 5}${choice: 1}[a preemptive strike/diversionary tactics/battleline preservation/stronghold fortification/troop conditioning/troop training/reconnaissance/sabotage]${color: 1}.${prompt};
Ah, so you wish to offer a comment regarding the Republic's internal policies.${prompt};
What exactly do you suggest?;
Bastok should focus on...;
${selection-lines};
Resource procurement.;
Military supply procurement.;
Logistics.;
Stronghold outfitting.;
Weapons production.;
Weapons development.;
Public security.;
Stronghold fortification.;
I require more time to consider.${prompt};
Interesting...;
Preparation for an extended campaign through the acquisition of large quantities of resources...${prompt};
An army cannot be successful without first obtaining sufficient quantities of supplies. You take after my own heart, soldier.${prompt};
Supplies are worthless if they do not arrive to their intended destination safely, and in times of war, supply line ambushes are frequent. By fortifying the routes, we can ensure prompt delivery and in turn increase our nation's defenses.${prompt};
Stabilization of supply flows to our strongholds will help in improving our basic defenses.${prompt};
Improved management of the Republic's guilds will ensure our soldiers aren't underequipped on the battlefield.${prompt};
Spoken like a true Bastoker. The Republic was built on ingenuity, and with improved weapons developed by those great minds in the Metalworks, our forces will cause even more havoc on the battlefield.${prompt};
A nation is only as strong as her people. The safety of the citizens should always come first.${prompt};
Ah, strong walls to fend off an enemy siege. A sound suggestion, soldier.${prompt};
Shall I record your opinion?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
I seem to recall recently delivering your opinion to the praefectus.${prompt};
I believe you suggested ${choice: 1}[the procurement of resources/the procurement of additional military supplies/improving logistics/better outfitting our strongholds/increased weapons production/advanced weapons development/improving public security/additional stronghold fortifications].${prompt};

I am very busy here. Stand down or I will call the guards!${prompt};
I've been waiting for you, ${name-player}. We have decided to increase our nation's supply stockpile to better ready ourselves for an extended campaign.${prompt};
You are to travel to ${choice: 2}[East Ronfaure/North Gustaberg/West Sarutabaruta/the Jugner Forest/Grauberg/Fort Karugo-Narugo] and use your ${choice: 2}[logging/mining/harvesting/logging/harvesting/logging] skills to find ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 1[2]}.${prompt};
You are to appropriate ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 1[2]} from the enemy. This is a very dangerous mission, but, if successful, will help weaken the hordes significantly.${prompt};
You are to collect a mere ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 1[2]}. If you cannot manage that, you might want to reconsider your participation in our forces.${prompt};
Unfortunately, our forces on the frontlines require a constant flow of rations to maintain their strength. Bring me ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 1[2]} and I will make sure that they are distributed properly.${prompt};
Unfortunately, our forces are running low on medicine. To prevent the further loss of any life, I need you to procure ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 1[2]}.${prompt};
Your orders are to procure ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 1[2]} and deliver them to me.${prompt};
Your orders are to procure ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 1[2]} and deliver them to me. This is a simple mission, but an important one nonetheless.${prompt};
Your orders are to procure ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 1[2]} and deliver them to me. This mission should be a good test of your abilities. Don't let us down.${prompt};
Your orders are to procure ${number: 3} ${item-given-plurality: 3[2], 1[2]} and deliver them to me. You will face many dangers on this mission, but the allied forces are counting on your success.${prompt};
Report to me when you've finished, but do not delay. Time is of the essence, ${name-player}.;
What is this? Are you still not finished carrying out your orders?${prompt};
Perhaps you should take notes.;
Excellent work, ${name-player}. Do not forget to report your completion of the mission to Sir Rasdinice.${prompt};
Excellent work, ${name-player}. Do not forget to report your completion of the mission to First Centurion Hieronymus.${prompt};
Excellent work, ${name-player}. Do not forget to report your completion of the mission to Emhi Tchaoryo.${prompt};
What are you waiting for, ${name-player}, a written invitation? Report to Sir Rasdinice on the double!${prompt};
What are you waiting for, ${name-player}, a written invitation? Report to Hieronymus on the double!${prompt};
What are you waiting for, ${name-player}, a written invitation? Report to Emhi Tchaoryo on the double!${prompt};
This is not the full order, ${name-player}.${prompt};
This is not the full order, ${name-player}. However, I'll accept what you have. Next time, make sure to procure all the items requested of you. Dismissed!${prompt};
I do not believe this is what your mission orders specify, ${name-player}.${prompt};
You the new temporay raid recruit? Alright, listen up, soldier!;
I'm gonna keep this short and simple, so's you can understand it real good-like.;
The sole purpose of your existence is to attack Beastman supply divisions and seize any viable cargo!${prompt};
Our best intelligence indicates that the enemy units we're after most frequently pass through an area when it is under Beastman influence.${prompt};
You are to infiltrate said area and promptly locate and dispatch said enemy.;
You are then to proceed to acquire any and all enemy-held supplies and return here with them.;
Is that understood, soldier!?${prompt};
Greetings, civilian. The Seventh Cohors of the Republican Legion's Fourth Division is currently recruiting new troops.${prompt};
You interested?${prompt};
Be all that you can be?;
${selection-lines};
I'm your ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman].;
Not today.${prompt};
Hmph. I guess the life of a soldier ain't for everyone. But if you ever have second thoughts, you come see me again.${prompt};
You can't join the Fighting Fourth while you're in the middle of applying to another allied army. Get your paperwork in order, civilian.${prompt};
Good answer. Now hand over your recommendation.${prompt};
You don't have one? Well, then how am I supposed to know you're not one of “them”? Sorry, but I'm gonna have to see you off.${prompt};
It seems that everything's in order. We can now begin your aptitude test.${prompt};
What, you want another shot at the Fighting Fourth? Well, I think something can be arranged.${prompt};
Alright. Your mission is simple--we need someone to deliver these ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Deliver them where, you ask?;
You've seen the watchtowers out in Gustaberg, right? There's one called Eduard and it's manned by a Centurion Gebhardt.${prompt};
You get these supplies to him safely, and you're in. Any questions? Good.;
Dismissed!${prompt};
I thought you didn't have any questions!;
Alright, I'll try to make myself a little clearer this time. Take those ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to the Eduard Watchtower in North Gustaberg and give them to Centurion Gebhardt. Got it?${prompt};
Or...maybe you're thinking of throwing in the towel.${prompt};
Well, are you?;
${selection-lines};
Sir, yes sir...;
Sir, no sir!${prompt};
Maybe I didn't hear you right!;
${selection-lines};
Sir, I'm sorry, sir...;
Sir, no sir!!!${prompt};
Having second thoughts, eh? The life of a soldier too tough for a coward like you? Ready to run back home to Momma!? Go on then! The Fighting Fourth is no place for pond scum like you.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} are taken away from ${name-player}!;
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is returned to you.;
That's what I thought. Now get those rations to the watchtower, double-time!${prompt};
Good work, rookie. You've passed the test with flying colors!${prompt};
...Or at least that's what I'd say if you had passed the test with flying colors...which you haven't.${prompt};
I heard from Centurion Gebhardt that he asked you a small favor. Are you suggesting that your initiation test is more important than a direct order from a superior?${prompt};
Well then, it seems you have a lot more to learn about teamwork and honor. Now if you'll just move along, civilian, I have things to do.${prompt};
Good. Now get your butt over to the Benedikt Watchtower if you know what's good for you, rookie!${prompt};
I heard the news about the ambush.${prompt};
Now, in a situation like this, a civilian would probably just run back to his Mog House and hide under the covers until the turtlebacks decided in their infinite wisdom to kindly return the stolen communication. But I ask you, rookie, what would a soldier do?${prompt};
So the kitchen starts to heat up, and you head for the door, eh? Well, that's good to know now, ain't it.;
On your way, civilian.${prompt};
Welcome back, rookie. I read the praefectus's report.${prompt};
It seems you bought us some time by keeping that thieving turtleback company until the cavalry arrived.${prompt};
Well done. Your initiation is complete. Consider yourself the newest member of the Fighting Fourth.${prompt};
And here's ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to commemorate the occasion. Talk to Evaluation Official Annabelle for the fine print.${prompt};
Now, for your real responsibilities--we need you out there fighting in the Allied Campaign. It's time to show those beastmen we won't forget what they did to our brothers and sisters in Grauberg.${prompt};
Head over to the next window and speak with Legion Engineer Aurelius...soldier!${prompt};
What are you doing, soldier? Head over to the next window and speak with Legion Engineer Aurelius on the double!${prompt};
So, you've finally come to your senses and decided to return to the Fighting Fourth?;
March on over to Centurion Fridolin and get your papers sorted out, soldier.${prompt};
Hey, you're in the way.;
We fortifyin' this here wall to withstand the beastmen's siege turrets.;
So how's about just gettin' outta here before you get hurt.${prompt};
Unless you're willin' to wipe that helpless look off your face and lend us a hand.;
That'd be a different story.${prompt};
Assist with the fortifications?;
${selection-lines};
Show them how it's done!;
Refuse to help.;
Ask for an explanation.${prompt};
Alright! That's the spirit!;
Let's get a move on, then.${prompt};
Hmph, I figured as much by lookin' at you.;
Beat it, then. This is no place for tourists.${prompt};
Like I said, in preparation for an enemy assault, we're workin' to fortify these defensive barriers.;
If you're willin', I'd like to place you in charge of managin' these here craftsmen as they go about it.${prompt};
To be more precise, once you get to each craftsman's position, you have to tell 'em exactly what I'm about to tell you.;
Namely, what type of crystal they need to be usin'. That's all there is to it.${prompt};
The young Elvaan wearin' the red hat is a blacksmith.;
Make sure he's using fire crystals.${prompt};
The adorable little Tarutaru with the blonde braids is laying plaster.;
Gonna have to get her on some ice crystals.${prompt};
The Hume lady is a stonemason, and a darn good one.;
She's gonna be needin' wind crystals.${prompt};
That old coot of an Elvaan with the huge axe strapped across his back is a carpenter.;
Famous 'round these parts. Make sure you get him workin' with earth crystals.${prompt};
May not look it, but the Mithra with the black kerchief wrapped 'round her noggin is an architect.;
She's gonna need her lightning crystals.${prompt};
That sprat of a Tarutaru wearin' the blue getup's a handy lil' plumber.;
Surin' he'll be wantin' his water crystals, no doubt.${prompt};
The good-looking fella in all white does scaffoldin'. Young Hume lad.;
See to it he's usin' light crystals.${prompt};
The lady Elvaan's a painter. Handles a brush like nobody I never seen.;
Need dark crystals in that line of work.;
And that's it.${prompt};
Ahhh, one more thing.;
If you're too late issuin' your orders, they're liable to up and leave their posts.;
So be right, and be quick.${prompt};
Choose a crystal!;
${selection-lines};
Fire crystal.;
Ice crystal.;
Wind crystal.;
Earth crystal.;
Lightning crystal.;
Water crystal.;
Light crystal.;
Dark crystal.;
Plumb give up.${prompt};
Hey now, you're runnin' this here operation!;
You can't just quit! There's no quitting in war!${prompt};
Wow... You sure botched that job. All them wrong orders threw the craftsmen off kilter.;
They're demandin' a new foreman.${prompt};
Well, the good news is you're gettin' your orders right.;
The bad news is that you're takin' your sweet time doing it.;
We'll never be ready for the Beastmen at this rate.${prompt};
Come on, now! You even want to win this war!?;
The craftsmen are startin' to strike thanks to your incompetence!${prompt};

I commend you on your expeditiousness.;
Thanks to you, the construction work on our provision storehouse here can proceed as planned.;

Time elapsed:;
You find nothing out of the ordinary.${prompt};
A shiver runs down your spine...${prompt};
Perhaps you should first attend to more pressing matters...${prompt};
Something tells you that you should wait a moment and try again.${prompt};
I am far too busy to speak with you now. Perhaps I'll have a little time later.${prompt};
Good show on your last operation. Now go make an official report to Sir Rasdinice.${prompt};
Good work on that last operation. Now report back to First Centurion Hieronymus before he has your hide!${prompt};
Nice job on your last operation. Now don't forget to report back to Emhi Tchaoryo!${prompt};
It seems that you were not successful in your last operation. But do not let one small failure hang heavy on your soul. Report to Sir Rasdinice and put this all behind you.${prompt};
Weren't so lucky during that last operation, were you? Well, don't worry about it too much. Report to First Centurion Hieronymus and get some rest, soldier.${prompt};
Hmmm... Didn't do so well on that last operation, did you? I know it's hard, but it's better if you're up-front about these things. If you know what's good for you, you'll hurry down and report to Emhi Tchaoryo before the major finds out first.${prompt};
Make haste, ${name-player}. Sir Rasdinice awaits your report!${prompt};
What are you waiting for, ${name-player}? Report to First Centurion Hieronymus on the double!${prompt};
Why are you wasting your time chatting with me? Shouldn't you be reporting to Emhi Tchaoryo?${prompt};
Good work, soldier. ${choice: 0}[The Kingdom/The Republic/The Federation] thanks you for your cooperation.${prompt};

Let the Blade of the Conqueror once again bring glory to the Kingdom!${prompt};
Gwahahaha! Let me cool you off a little before I send you to hell!${prompt};
Father! Lend me your strength!${prompt};
For the king!${prompt};
My spear is lightning...and your scream shall be the thunder which follows my mighty strike!${prompt};
Ha hah! Your arrows cannot pierce the iron will of a true knight!${prompt};
This arrow to your heart shall be Altana's final judgment.${prompt};
Shogyo Mujo!;
Zesho Meppo!;
Shometsu Metsui!;
Jakumetsu Iraku!${prompt};
There is no escape...save death!${prompt};
Altana! Let your divine light guide us to victory!${prompt};
You barbarians will regret the day you set foot on Bastokan soil!${prompt};
Ryaaaaaaaaah!${prompt};
Men! Do not fear the enemy! It is our blades they shall fear!${prompt};
A swift end is the only mercy you will receive from me, fiends!${prompt};
Watch carefully, because this is the last thing you'll ever see in this life!${prompt};
I never liked fighting on land... Now, give me a well armed battleship on the open sea, and I'll have those turtlebacks running for their lives!${prompt};
A soldier always comes prepared! Hehehehe!${prompt};
To your seats, boys! The show is about to begin!${prompt};
Ahahahaha! My hand slipped!${prompt};
This is your last chance. Throw down your weapons and your life will be spared. If you refuse...${prompt};
The gates to the underworld have opened! I'll see you on the other side...or not! Wahahahahah!${prompt};
There is nothing more magnificent than the dance of flames on the battlefield!${prompt};
<Phew!> I think I've had enough of this volume!${prompt};
Guttler: Guttler thirsty! Guttler want blood! More blood!${prompt};
Time to go to work!${prompt};
Invincible! Indestructible! Indubitable! The age of the Cardians is upon us!${prompt};
You, over there. No, wait! You're supposed to be on that side! Hold on, which one were you again? Arrrghhh!${prompt};
<Snorrre>... Is that the best you can do?${prompt};
Petty beastman hordes are nothing compared to giant wildebeests of homeland! I swat you all down like fruit flies!${prompt};
<Yawn>... Um... Holy light...show the way...?${prompt};
The protection of the throne comes before all else. Only by direct order of the royaulais will I wield my blade on the battlefield. Such is the duty of the Royal Guards.${prompt};
Hah hah hah! The ringing of steel upon steel! The dripping stench of the battlefield! What could be better than war? The nobles can have their balls, I'll do my dance on the front lines!${prompt};
How dare a baseborn peasant raise ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] voice to a noble knight!? Begone, before I strike you down myself!${prompt};
The Kingdom's defeat at Jugner still stings. To avenge the souls of those lost on that fateful day, we must join hands and take up arms as one.${prompt};
Not once in the four hundred years since the dawn of the Royal Knights has the Kingdom found itself in such peril. Let us take up our pikes and stand our ground to ensure another four centuries of prosperity!${prompt};
It is often in times of strife that a man's true nature is revealed. Will you stand tall in the face of fear, or run and cower in the wake of your mother's dress?${prompt};
While our holy doctrines specifically prohibit the taking of another life, you need not hesitate on the battlefield. The Church has branded the beastmen enemies of Altana. The purification must begin! It is the will of the Goddess!!!${prompt};
After years of training in the Far East, I return only to find my nation burning at the hands of the infernal beastman hordes.;
The heathens shall pay dearly... My work has only just begun.${prompt};
You have the look of a fine warrior. It is a pity you are not one of my Crimson Wolves.${prompt};
The eyes of the Goddess are ever upon us. We must remain steadfast against the evils from without, as well as those from within.${prompt};
The Republic was formed with the blood and sweat of the people. The flames of freedom must continue to light our furnaces of strength. The waters of civilization must continue to turn our wheels of ingenuity!${prompt};
Turtle sleeps in a rocky den♪;
Strike him down with sword and stave♪;
Stick a blue flag in his grave♪${prompt};
We may have the upper hand in technology and munitions, but the enemy's advantage lies in their sheer numbers. The Allied Campaign will not win in a day, soldier. Make every bullet count.${prompt};
The Metalworks' strategies are too timid for my taste. The beastmen are nothing but dominoes, waiting to be toppled. A swift, aggressive assault is the only way to victory.${prompt};
Move along, soldier. I have nothing to say to you.${prompt};
Halt!;
If you're not one of the Fourth, then get your sorry tail over to the recruitment office on the double! And if you are one of us, then what the hell are you doing here talking to me!? Get back on the battlefield! About...FACE!${prompt};
...Heavy infantry, five columns of 200... Two 100-knight regiments... Enemy force casualties estimated at 5,000...;
Oh, I apologize, soldier. I've spent the past few nights preparing for a joint operation with San d'Oria's Royal Knights.${prompt};
You look like you've seen better days, soldier. Let me guess, it's the war that's bringing you down. What you need is a little music in your life!${prompt};
If it weren't for the Galkan heavy infantry, this nation wouldn't last a month against the turtlebacks. And what thanks do we get? A handful of stale army biscuits!${prompt};
Have you ever stopped to ponder what that comet might truly portend? I'd like to believe it is a message of hope--that soon this age of darkness will come to a close...${prompt};
Oh, whatever has become of my sweet Windurst? Rabble running through the streets, streets overrun with rabble! Why are you even speaking to me!? Does the title Master Caster no longer garner even an onz of respect!?${prompt};
Ah, the Fates have brought you to Gariri the Magnificent! Why am I thus called, you ask? Why, because only I was magnificent enough to decryptify those mysteriously marvelous Near Eastern tomes and open a window to...the Other Side!${prompt};
We all wear masks because deep down inside we are nothing but beasts. The question I ask you is, to which do you submit--the mask, or the beast?${prompt};
(Guttler! I told you to keep qui--);
Ahahahah... Don't mind me, I was just...uh...keeping myself company!;
(Shhh! If you open your mouth one more ti--);
Ahahaha... Uh, were you still there?${prompt};
If only the Parliament of Patriarchs would loosen the strings on their purses a little more, I would be outside right now roasting up a couple birdmen to snack on!${prompt};
Have fun while you can, filthy mercenary, because before long you'll be back on the streets where you belong--replaced by a quiet, obedient army of Cardians!${prompt};
Normally, it is my duty to protect the patriarchs of parliament, but with the fate of Windurst in doubt, I'm forced to lead my loyal pets to the front lines.${prompt};
Do you like the headpiece? I made it from my firrrst victim. I wear it to let everrryone know what happens when they cross Mikhe Aryohcha!${prompt};
Back in my home, Ulbuka, I hear rumors of great riches in eastern lands. But now I am here, and where are riches? I see nothing but Tarus! Ahahahaha!${prompt};
<Yaaawn>... Mastering these Near Eastern magics can be quite taxing. If I had a choice, I'd rather be back in bed, relaxing...${prompt};
I saved this one especially for you!${prompt};
Hiiiiii-yah!${prompt};
My dear pupil, Dalzakk. You still have much to learn...${prompt};
Witness the true embodiment of my sorrow.${prompt};
Heh heh heh!${prompt};
<Giggle>...${prompt};
Wheheheheh! You thirsty, Kopeh?${prompt};
Come, Kilhwch! We must strike down the evil which stands before us!${prompt};
My brothers and sisters! Raise your blades for justice!${prompt};
Kilhwch! Silence those fiends!${prompt};
To your feet, Kilhwch!${prompt};
Lady Ulla. We must retreat.${prompt};
How dare you!${prompt};
The raven shalt spare nary a tear for thy demise.${prompt};
Watch! And see how a real mercenary earrrns her wage!${prompt};
Leave me be. The verge of battle is no time for words.${prompt};
Fear not. My fists will guide us to victory.${prompt};
My daughter awaits her father at home.;
I will permit no Beastman to delay my return.${prompt};
Beyond this point lies the sealed royal tomb of King Ranperre.;
Tell me, ${name-player}, do you believe the legends?${prompt};
The Orc war machine draws near.;
We must brace ourselves for battle.${prompt};
In former times, this island was inhabited by a ferocious tribe of vikings.;
It is said they braved vast expanses of open sea to arrive here.;
Romantic, don't you think?${prompt};
Surely you have seen the tigers that roam these downs.;
They were brought from the northern continent by the Orcs themselves.;
They are highly prized for their luxurious pelts, though their bloodlust makes them formidable game.${prompt};
The brotherhood of this place once welcomed me long ago.;
I pray that the years have been kind to them.${prompt};
The Gold Musketeers of the Republican Army are marshalled by young woman.;
Such talk is sure to inspire my daughter.${prompt};
Bastok was forced to abandon the Palborough Mines following a Beastman invasion.;
How an army such as the Republic's could permit such an affront baffles me to no end.${prompt};
The village elder in La Vaule told me of the so-called wyrm deity of Grauberg.;
Of course, I am sure it is nothing more than folktales. Still, my curiosity is piqued...${prompt};
Strange... I am certain the vegetation of this area is different from when I last visited.;
Surely I would not have allowed myself to forget such beautiful flowers.${prompt};
Such devasation...;
Even the resilient Goobbue were not able to survive.;
I wonder if this place shall ever be restored to its former glory...${prompt};
History tells us that it was in the year 381 that San d'Oria's iron-tempered  King Lanfeaur R d'Oraguille came these lands to strike a peace with the Quadav. Whatever happened to the bond that was formed...?${prompt};
I have seen here two twins who between them share a power for magic the likes of which I have never seen.;
This is indeed a strange nation.${prompt};
Unfortunate... I had always wished to gaze upon the fabled magic towers of West Sarutabaruta with my own eyes.;
Yet I fear I may be too late...${prompt};
This fortress is lauded as the impregnable point of Windurst's defenses.;
Goddess forbid, should it happen to be taken, Windurst is unlikely to last more than a month's time.${prompt};
These windblown sands reak havoc on my throat.;
I look forward to a cup of my daughter's fine Batallia tea.${prompt};
Take heed, ${name-player}. I have seen Beastman-dug battle trenches throughout these plains.;
Should you be found, your life is forfeit.${prompt};
There is an ominous feeling in the air...;
This is no place to linger.${prompt};
Never have I felt a cold as piercing as this.;
My teeth chatter and my toes grow numb.;
We would do well to find a place to warm ourselves.${prompt};
I wonder if it was not somewhere near here where minister Francmage was dispatched on the Multinational Expedition some 10 years ago.${prompt};
Never did I imagine the day would come that I would set foot in this accursed place.;
Has great is our foe's desperation? Do not lower your guard, ${name-player}.${prompt};
And so we breach the enemy's inner sanctum. Expect anything, ${name-player}!;
And don't die on me!${prompt};
As the Allied Forces have long maintained, this citadel would be ideally suited to the defense of Jeuno.${prompt};
A well conceived strategy...;
A stronghold established under the cover of the nest of these vile crawlers.;
It is almost surely to be overlooked by the enemy.${prompt};
Oh, mighty Altana, be the sword in my hand.;
With you, the swift cannot flee, nor the strong escape.;
Receive mine enemies, for the mercy of the Goddess embraces even the wicked.${prompt};
Heh heh heh!;
Wonder what technique I should try out on these ol' beastmen chumps.${prompt};
Haha...;
Who will be the next darling recipient of my spells?${prompt};
Red blood, blue blood, any colorrr blood.;
If it bleeds, we can kill it!${prompt};
What's taking so long? I'm getting all antsy-wantsy!;
My pets are I are all bad at staying still...${prompt};
Do not fear. Righteousness will prevail.;
I shall show you victory!${prompt};
Promise me one thing.;
Should anything happen to me... Look after my daughter.${prompt};
I reckon I'll be earnin' my keep.;
Won't be doin' nothin' extra, though. Don't be expectin' me to risk my hide without my due an' proper, mm-hmmm.${prompt};
Bravo really is a dear once you get to know him.;
It's just that in the heat of battle he... Well, you'll see.${prompt};
My blade, Kyomon, anticipates much beastman blood.;
This battle may prove interesting, yet.${prompt};
Look to me, mortals!;
And be haunted for the rest of your brief time in this world!${prompt};
For a split second, you thought you saw Titania turn and shoot you a tiny smile.${prompt};
The flower atop Babban Ny Mheillea's head appears to be in full bloom!${prompt};
Ribbit! Ribbit!${prompt};
You'd better watch your back!${prompt};
Don't take this personally, but I've got children to feed.${prompt};
Time to have some fun!${prompt};
Reckon it's time tuh earn my keep, mm-hmm.${prompt};
Come now, Bravo!;
It's high time we taught these beasts what a wyvern is truly capable of!${prompt};
Hehe, so many willing to be sacrificed!${prompt};
Hmph. Perhaps I should just burn the eyes of these infidels with my true form.${prompt};
I fear not death, for the Goddess awaits us with open arms.${prompt};
It is not yet your time.${prompt};
Be strong, for the Goddess is with you, always.${prompt};
Return to the dust whence you came!;

Due to the strain the war has put on our supply levels, the Allied War Council has recommended that we hire hundreds of new initiates to help with the synthesis of new items. However, with the guildmasters all working overtime manufacturing goods, we don't have enough manpower to aid us in the training of the new recruits.${prompt};
Because our guild members are working around the clock making supplies, they do not have the time to learn new techniques or develop new methods. If you have extensive training in a skill and wouldn't mind passing that knowledge on to a fellow craftsman, we could sure use the help.${prompt};
Would you lend a hand?;

Of course!;
I'm sorry. My hands are tied.${prompt};
That is unfortunate. There are men and women dying on the frontlines because they don't have the supplies they need to drive back the beastman hordes. If you are just going to look the other way, then so be it...${prompt};

Excellent, the senator will be pleased.${prompt};
Did you experience any trouble?${prompt};
Senator Werner was trailed by one of Chairman Pale Eagle's spies?${prompt};
The chairman is a senior member of the Republican government, appointed to his position by President Prien himself...${prompt};
He often clashes with Senator Werner in matters of military policy.${prompt};
I don't know what schemes the chairman has in motion, but you would do well to keep an eye out.${prompt};
Oh, and there's one more thing I meant to ask.${prompt};
You're not the agent I was expecting, are you?${prompt};
I was told to welcome the one who brought me ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
It wasn't until later that I discovered the real agent had collapsed at the gates to the city.${prompt};
If the senator should realize I've introduced him to the wrong operative...!${prompt};
Oh, and it's not just my neck that's on the line--the senator is a very thorough man.${prompt};
You must continue to accept Senator Werner's tasks as if nothing were amiss.;
Your continued well-being, not to mention mine, depends on it.${prompt};
A chance meeting has landed you right in the thick of things, my friend.;
I have a feeling we'll be getting to know each other very well indeed.${prompt};
Ah, I have your remuneration.;
Jeuno currency. Untraceable.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]} is pressed into ${name-player}'s hand!${prompt};
I'm glad you've returned.;
The senator has set us a new task.${prompt};
You will accept, won't you?${prompt};
Accept the task?;
${selection-lines};
It seems I have little choice...;
I won't be threatened!${prompt};
The senator doesn't make threats--he only makes promises.${prompt};
A wise decision.;
Here's the situation.${prompt};
We're seeing some unrest in a section of the Galkan population...;
No, let's be perfectly clear: they are planning an uprising.${prompt};
The mastermind behind this revolution appears to be none other than Chairman Pale Eagle.${prompt};
As you might be aware, President Prien was elected on the strength of his campaign promises--improvements to living conditions and education for all.${prompt};
But with the outbreak of war, these improvements have failed to materialize, and the Galka who supported Prien's campaign have grown disillusioned and angry.${prompt};
Under cover of the chaos sown by the Beastman Confederate, the ambitious chairman is attempting to capitalize on the dissatisfaction of the Galkan citizens to seize power for himself.${prompt};
During his military days, the chairman was known as the “Eagle of Grauberg.” If the soldiers still loyal to this former general join in the coup, the ensuing civil war will tear Bastok asunder!${prompt};
Thankfully, Senator Werner is one step ahead of his rival...${prompt};
Your task will be to confirm certain information that will defuse this civil war before it even begins.${prompt};
Chairman Pale Eagle has had dealings with the Galkan elder Werei and his friend Gumbah.${prompt};
There are rumors that these two are hoarding a stockpile of weapons in preparation for the coming uprising.${prompt};
Our sources also tell us that this Werei is teaching swordplay to the youngster Pagdako. Does he mean to arm even the children in this madness...?${prompt};
Find these Galka, and learn the truth behind their motives.${prompt};
There are rumors that the Galkan elder Werei and his friend Gumbah are hoarding a stockpile of weapons. Go, and discover the truth behind their motives.${prompt};
You want to meet with Werei and Gumbah?;
What for?${prompt};
So, you've come to investigate the “troublemakers” as well, have you?${prompt};
No need to answer. It's written plain on your face.${prompt};
I don't know who put you up to this, but we have no interest in igniting a civil war.${prompt};
I won't try to convince you that more than a few Galka aren't unhappy with the president's rule.${prompt};
That's why Werei is making the rounds, trying to calm the rising anger.${prompt};
This conversation is over.;
Don't neglect your sword practice, Pagdako. The road to becoming a Mythril Musketeer is a long one.${prompt};
Elder Werei always says that to me.;
I wonder if I'll ever be a Mythril Musketeer...${prompt};
Elder Werei is teaching me the art of swordfighting. One day, I'll be just as good as Sir Raogrimm!${prompt};
Have you learned anything useful?${prompt};
Werei and Gumbah make frequent visits to Grauberg, you say?${prompt};
Grauberg...;
That mountain is riddled with caves--the perfect place to hide a stockpile of weapons.${prompt};
I shall communicate this information to Senator Werner.;
Meanwhile, head to Grauberg and see if you can confirm my suspicions.${prompt};
Head to Grauberg and see if you can confirm my suspicions about the stockpile of weapons.${prompt};
Elder Werei and Gumbah have been arrested!;
What's going on!?${prompt};
Have you heard the news!?${prompt};
S-S-Senator Werner...;
Rumors are flying around that he was assassinated in the Metalworks!${prompt};
The details are still unclear.;
Others are saying it was nothing more than an unauthorized intruder. I wish I could find out more, but the Metalworks is under tight security...${prompt};
I hope the senator was unharmed...${prompt};
The Metalworks has been locked down for security reasons.;
Only authorized personnel may enter!${prompt};
What news of the senator?${prompt};
You'd best see for yourself.;
And these men...?${prompt};
Second Division Military Police.;
We were in the midst of discussing a separate matter.${prompt};
When we heard that the Senator of Defense was attacked, they insisted on accompanying me to the scene.${prompt};
You have our full cooperation.${prompt};
Hm? Aren't you...${prompt};
A colleague of yours?${prompt};
This is the informant that was instrumental in Werei's arrest.${prompt};
I see.;
Well, if we're done with the introductions, it's time we were heading inside.${prompt};
Hm?;
Where do you think you're going!?${prompt};
...!${prompt};
Senator Werner!${prompt};
Dead when I found him.;
He was last seen heading into the Metalworks after meeting with the president in the Consul's Office.${prompt};
According to the medic, there are multiple vicious stab wounds to the chest.;
This crime was motivated by anger...${prompt};
And the intruder escaped?${prompt};
The assassin was never seen.;
We locked down all exits as soon as the body was discovered--the guards are currently performing a thorough sweep of the entire building.${prompt};
First Werei and Gumbah's arrest, and now this murder right under our very noses...dammit!${prompt};
Where are we on this talk of an uprising?;
Surely the rumors aren't true...!?${prompt};
We still don't know for sure.;
Elder Werei and Gumbah are in the custody of the Second Division Military Police.${prompt};
The investigation is proceeding as we speak.${prompt};
We could certainly use some answers.${prompt};
Captain!${prompt};
Mister President!;
Your plans to inspect the battlefield...?${prompt};
Canceled.${prompt};
How could such violence be perpetrated within a stone's throw of the President's Office!?${prompt};
Not only was our security breached, but a senior member of the government assassinated...;
Never have the Musketeers failed so completely in their duty!${prompt};
As commanding officer, I will submit myself to any forthcoming punishment...!${prompt};
Lift your head, Klara.${prompt};
Senator Werner was a brilliant man, who devoted his entire being to the future of the Republic.${prompt};
The most fitting tribute to his life will be to catch the criminal behind this and bring down the full force of Republican law.${prompt};
For now, I suggest we pray for the peace of his soul.${prompt};
Who was responsible for security during Senator Werner's visit?${prompt};
I was...${prompt};
Zeid.;
I find it hard to believe you of all people were lax in your vigilance.;
How did this intruder slip past our defenses...?${prompt};
I'm putting you in charge of this investigation, Zeid.;
Restore the good name of the Musketeers!${prompt};
Understood.${prompt};
Volker!;
You are to assist him.${prompt};
Yes, Captain!${prompt};
I will convene an emergency meeting of the Republican Defense Council and the Galkan Elders.${prompt};
And I will assume the duties of the Senator of Defense for the time being.;
We have work to do, Captain.${prompt};
Sir!${prompt};
Why do we have unauthorized personnel in here?${prompt};
Yes, I'm talking about you.;
Leave the premises immediately!${prompt};
They're going to do more than cut my pay for letting that informant slip through a security lockdown...${prompt};
You!;
Don't think you'll pass by me twice!${prompt};
The rumors of the assassination were true!?${prompt};
Senator Werner is dead...${prompt};
Recently, an unknown agent had been trailing his every move--I'd bet the future of the Republic that's the assassin they're looking for.${prompt};
With the senator gone, I doubt I'll have any more tasks for you.;
Thank you for your competent, albeit brief, service.${prompt};
Take this.;

If you seek admission to the Knights of the Iron Ram, speak with Sir Mainchelite.${prompt};
Looking to join the Fighting Fourth?;
Speak to Centurion Adelbrecht. He'll assist you.${prompt};
So you think you have what it takes to be a Cobra? Well, then talk to Miah Riyuh and hope that she's in a good mood!${prompt};
For the lion!${prompt};
Give 'em hell, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Shouldn't you be out campaigning? Now get!${prompt};
I see you serve under another nation.${prompt};
I see you're working for another nation.${prompt};
Says here you've already gone and joined some other nation's forces.${prompt};
If you seek admission to the Knights of the Iron Ram, speak with Sir Mainchelite.${prompt};
If you're looking to join the Fighting Fourth, speak to Centurion Adelbrecht. He'll assist you.${prompt};
If you've finally come to your senses and decided on joining the Cobras then talk to Miah Riyuh...and hope that she's in a good mood!${prompt};
If you seek to regain admission to the Knights of the Iron Ram, you must first sever ties with your nation of allegiance...and that will require Allied Notes.${prompt};
Though if you want to rejoin the fourth, I think something can be worked out. You have some Allied Notes, don't you?${prompt};
But if you've finally come to your senses and decided to return to the Cobras, I think I can pull a few strings...for a price. You're carrying Allied Notes, right?${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}Please note that upon changing allegiance, you will be required to return the two most prestigious campaign medals you possess. There is no penalty if you have yet to earn any medals.${prompt};
${prompt};
Exchange ${number: 2} Allied ${choice-plurality: 2}[Note/Notes] to transfer from ${choice: 0}[/the Knights of the Iron Ram/the Fourth Division/the Cobra Unit] to ${choice: 1}[/the Knights of the Iron Ram/the Fourth Division/the Cobra Unit]? You currently possess ${number: 3} ${choice-plurality: 3}[Allied Note/Allied Notes].${prompt};

${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};

${color-alt: 121}You cannot pledge your allegiance to one nation while undertaking initiation procedures of another. Withdraw your current application before attempting a transfer.${prompt};
You return your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};

${color-alt: 121}You do not possess enough Allied Notes to change your allegiance.${prompt};
Fourth Legion, Seventh Cohors... Ah, here we are. ${name-player}, right? Legion Engineer Aurelius at your service.${prompt};
The centurion has given me orders to assist all legionnaires in understanding the inner-workings of the Allied Campaign.${prompt};
What can I help you with today?;
${selection-lines};
What is the Allied Campaign?;
What are campaign operations?;
Nothing.${prompt};
The Allied Campaign is the comprehensive name given to the various operations carried out by the Forces of Altana against the Beastman Confederate.${prompt};
“Article 1: Dominion is granted the nation that provides the largest contribution in regaining control of an area occupied by the beastmen.”${prompt};
“Article 2: In exchange for the renouncing of all claims to lands seized by their army, campaign arbitration has been bestowed upon the Grand Duchy of Jeuno.”${prompt};
The leaders of Jeuno were first to recognize that it would be difficult for the nations of Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria to cast aside all past differences and join hands on the battlefield.${prompt};
And that's why the Duchy felt it necessary to motivate the armies by offering rewards for their valor. In other words, we can still compete against those dogs in San d'Oria even though we have to fight alongside them.${prompt};
As you know, our nation's wealth lies in the natural resources that lie beneath the arid plains of Gustaberg. However, by taking advantage of Article 1 of the Allied Campaign charter, Bastok can lay claim to the fertile lands to the north, thus bolstering our economy even further!${prompt};
As a provisionary member of the Fighting Fourth, you will be required to participate in various campaign missions and operations to help ensure the prosperity of the Republic.${prompt};
Campaign operations, also known as ${color: 5}Campaign Ops${color: 1}, is the term used for the long list of small-scale missions authorized by the Allied War Council in Jeuno.${prompt};
When an operation is successfully completed, the nation is rewarded with an increase in battle funding, paid for by the Repositorium--an international bank founded by the four nations of Mindartia and Quon, and located in Jeuno.${prompt};
To put it bluntly, the harder you work, the richer the Republic becomes.${prompt};
Now don't get the wrong idea. That money is for the Republican Legion, not for you to spend at the local pub. No, you'll be rewarded with Allied Notes, which can be used to purchase supplies and equipment. You'll also be allowed to participate in more sensitive operations.${prompt};
Now unless you have any more questions, you are to report to First Centurion Hieronymus on my left.${prompt};
He will assist you in applying for an operation. Good luck, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Ah, itching to get out on the battlefield now, are we?;
Alright, just let me explain a little about the Allied Campaign map, and then you can go.${prompt};
To view the campaign map, first select ${color: 5}Region Info${color: 1}, and then ${color: 5}Campaign${color: 1}.;
The ${color: 5}sword${color: 1} indicates areas where battles are currently being waged.;
If you are not signed up for any operations, then hurry to the frontlines and join your fellow legionnaires.;
The ${color: 5}heroism gauge${color: 1} indicates locations where the battles have become quite heated. Who knows what may occur in an area with a full gauge?${prompt};
That is all. Normally, war doesn't let you choose your battles, but this time it's different. We trust that you will choose wisely.${prompt};
${color: 5}Freelances${color: 1} is the collective term given to rogue commandos who have not pledged allegiance to any nation.${prompt};
These groups do not fall under control of the Allied Forces, and only fight when and where they feel like it. Heroes for hire, you could say.${prompt};
However, many of them are proven fighters, and that is something an army can never have too many of.${prompt};
If you ever come across one of these freelances, see if you can't convince them to lend their swords to a just cause. The worse they can do is say no, right?${prompt};
Might you be thinking about joining the Republican Legion? If that's the case, then go speak with Centurion Adelbrecht. He'll assist you.${prompt};
You're not a member of the Republican Legion, are you? If you're thinking about signing up, then you'll first have to pledge allegiance to Bastok. Speak with Centurion Fridolin for assistance.${prompt};
I'm terribly sorry, but chocobo services are currently unavailable.${prompt};
Through this tunnel lie the Fourth Division barracks. While far from luxurious, the rooms provide troops with a place to store their belongings, receive packages, and rest up before missions.${prompt};
Salutations, I am Campaign Evaluation Official Alfred. How might I be of assistance?${prompt};
Greetings, I am Campaign Evaluation Official Annabelle. How can I help you today?${prompt};
Hello, I'm Campaign Evaluation Official Llewellyn. How can I help you today?${prompt};
What do you require?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing.;
An evaluation.;
Info on the duration of my medal.;
An overview of evaluations.;
Info on medals.;
Info on the benefits of medals.;
Info on evaluation process.${prompt};
Evaluations are conducted on all participants of the Allied Campaign. Individual data is collected by the Allied War Council from various sources, such as Campaign Arbiters and the leaders of the armies in which the soldiers serve. This data is then used to determine whether or not a decoration is to be conferred.${prompt};
Some of the areas that are considered in this evaluation are performance in campaign operations, as well as valor shown during campaign battles.${prompt};
The more an individual is decorated, the more responsibility he or she will be given within the Allied Forces. And with more responsibility comes the promise of larger compensation in exchange for services.${prompt};
However, the prestige that accompanies the medals also carries with it a great weight. To maintain one's status, he or she must continue to exceed previous expectations. If a soldier fails to fulfill the duties that are required of all those who possess a certain medal, then the Allied War Council will be forced to confiscate that decoration.${prompt};
To put it simply, only those who fight with fervor and precision...only those who put the glory of the Allied Campaign above all else...will be allowed to reap the benefits that come with victory.${prompt};
If you wish to learn more of the Allied Campaign, please speak with ${choice: 3}[/Lady Fiaudie/Centurion Aurelius/Kolin-Olin].${prompt};
There are two more things of note.${prompt};
Once an evaluation has been requested, the Allied War Council will require ${choice: 0}[five days/one hour] (Earth time) to come to a conclusion.${prompt};
During that time, individuals may join as many operations or battles as they wish, but will only be considered for a single medal.${prompt};
However, the same rules apply for an inadequate performance. No matter how low one scores, the maximum number of decorations that can be confiscated is one.${prompt};
Also, individuals must not forget that all medals come with expiration dates. While an extremely unorthodox practice, this measure was deemed necessary to prevent the forgery of allied decorations by those persons with dubious intentions.${prompt};
Upon conferral, all medals are marked with a magical seal that dissipates after a period of thirty days (Earth time). Once the seal has vanished, the medal will become void and its owner will no longer be able to participate in campaign operations or battles, among other things.${prompt};
It is highly recommended that you keep track of the time remaining on your medal and apply for evaluations regularly.${prompt};
Is there anything else you wish to ask?${prompt};
Campaign medals are official rewards given to those individuals who perform exemplary deeds for the Allied Forces.${prompt};
These decorations are internationally recognized as symbols of strength, loyalty, and honor. They not only garner respect, but provide their bearers with privileges not offered civilians.${prompt};
Those who have been decorated with the more prestigious medals will also be highly regarded among their army's ranks, and thus entrusted with increasingly difficult and important missions.${prompt};
On the other hand, disloyalty to one's nation is highly frowned upon. If, for any reason, an individual wishes to leave their current army of employment and pledge allegiance to another, they will be required to return their two most distinguished medals.${prompt};
To the point, are we? Very well, I shall list the merits those in the possession of medals may receive.${prompt};
Firstly, the more prestigious an individual's medal, the more weight ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] army's ${choice: 3}[/curate/supply commander/Morale Manager] will grant ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] opinion.${prompt};
Secondly, the types of Campaign Ops available to an individual will increase based on the medals that ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] has in ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] possession. More advanced operations will earn participants increased amounts of EXP and Allied Notes, as well as have a heavier influence on performance evaluations.${prompt};
Thirdly, benefits received during campaign battles will vary depending on the variety of medals an individual carries. The better the medals, the larger the opportunity to earn EXP, Allied Notes, and reputation. The selection of temporary items available for purchase will also improve.${prompt};
However, the more prestigious the medal, the more that will be expected of its bearer. The Campaign Arbiters will not go easy on those who have already proven themselves.${prompt};
Understood?${prompt};
Greetings, ${name-player}. My ledger states that the earliest you can apply for an evaluation is in ${number: 0} day${choice-plurality: 0}[/s].${prompt};
Greetings, ${name-player}. My ledger states that the earliest you can apply for an evaluation is in ${number: 0} hour${choice-plurality: 0}[/s].${prompt};
Greetings, ${name-player}. My ledger states that the earliest you can apply for an evaluation is...any moment now.${prompt};
Is there something I can help you with in the meantime?${prompt};
Greetings, soldier. Unfortunately, I cannot authorize the evaluations of those individuals who have not pledged their allegiance to this nation's forces.${prompt};
Understood. I shall prepare the proper documents and deliver them to the Allied War Council Evaluation Board in Jeuno.${prompt};
......${prompt};
Congratulations, ${name-player}! Your recent performance has been evaluated, and the Allied War Council has deemed you worthy of a new medal!${prompt};
Accept the honors?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Are you sure?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
One moment, please, while I prepare your award.${prompt};
That will be enough, officer. I shall complete the ceremony.${prompt};
${choice-player-gender}[Sir/Lady] ${name-player}, I commend you on your service to the Kingdom!${prompt};
But remember, as you accept this ${keyitem-singular: 5[2]}, the path before you grows ever more perilous. Succumb not to the evils of lethargy, lest you find yourself stripped bare of your past honors.${prompt};
That will be enough. I'll take it from here, soldier.${prompt};
Ahem!;
${name-player}, for exemplary service to the Republic of Bastok, I present you with the ${keyitem-singular: 5[2]}!;
Dismissed!${prompt};
...;
Why are you still here, soldier!? There are beastmen to be pummeled! Now, march!${prompt};
Hold on a minute. I'll take it from herrre.${prompt};
${name-player}!;
...;
...;
Good work. Here's your ${keyitem-singular: 5[2]}.${prompt};
Oh, and don't go getting the wrrrong idea. The reason you're wearing that medal isn't because “you” are a fine soldier, it's because you're backed by the best damn unit in the Federation. Dismissed!${prompt};
That is all. Please note that you will not be eligible for another evaluation for ${choice: 7}[five days/one hour] (Earth time). Good luck, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Are you certain, ${name-player}? You know there is no need to be humble.${prompt};
Or perhaps you have forgotten that it doesn't matter how much you contribute to the Allied Campaign, you can only receive one medal per evaluation.${prompt};
I cannot force you to accept the medal, but...${prompt};
While the Allied War Council was pleased with your work, it was determined that your performance did not warrant the conferral of further decoration.${prompt};
You still have ${number: 2} day${choice-plurality: 2}[/s] (Earth time) until your current campaign medal expires.${prompt};
Your current campaign medal will expire in less than a day (Earth time).${prompt};
Your current campaign medal has already expired.${prompt};
Would you like to continue this month's evaluation in a further attempt to receive the next medal, or would you rather end the evaluation and maintain your current honors?${prompt};
End the evaluation?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Excellent.;
Speak with me again when you are ready to submit your next application. Good luck, ${name-player}.${prompt};
By ending the evaluation, you will have accepted the war council's decision to maintain your current rank, and be granted another thirty-day seal on your current medal.${prompt};
However, any work you have done during the past evaluation period towards the procurement of the next medal will become null and void.${prompt};
Please consider carefully your options before making this important decision.${prompt};
Are you absolutely sure?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Done. Your medal has been given a new magic seal.${prompt};
Please note that you will be eligible for your next evaluation in ${choice: 7}[five days/one hour] (Earth time).${prompt};
......;
I am sorry, ${name-player}, but the war council was not at all pleased with your performance, and has deemed you unworthy of your highest-ranking medal.${prompt};
It shall be confiscated the moment its magic seal expires.${prompt};
You have two choices left, ${name-player}. You may either accept the council's decision, or, if your medal's seal still holds, you may continue your efforts to improve your evaluation.${prompt};
It retains ${number: 2} day${choice-plurality: 2}[/s] (Earth time) of power.${prompt};
However, it retains less than a day's power (Earth time).${prompt};
Unfortunately, it no longer retains any power...${prompt};
What is your decision?${prompt};
You can...;
${selection-lines};
Return the medal at once.;
Continue your efforts.${prompt};
Are you certain?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Excellent.;
Speak with me again when you are ready to submit your next application. Good luck, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Understood. Perhaps the weight of this medal was a bit too much for you, ${name-player}.${prompt};
If you wish to submit another application for evaluation, please visit me again in ${choice: 7}[five days'/one hour's] time.${prompt};
......;
I regret to inform you, ${name-player}, that your performance this term fell a measure short of the council's expectations.;
Admittedly high expectations, but nevertheless...${prompt};
Still, you have proven your worth to our nation on many an occasion.;
In light of your past services, the council has seen fit to exempt you from demotion at this time.${prompt};
Incidentally, your seal will remain effective for ${number: 2} more day${choice-plurality: 2}[/s] (Earth time).${prompt};
Incidentally, your seal retains less than a day's power (Earth time).${prompt};
Incidentally, your seal is no longer effective.${prompt};
You may end your evaluation here, or press on.;
What say you?${prompt};
Very well.;
We will be following your continued efforts with interest.${prompt};
By ending the evaluation, you will have accepted the war council's decision to maintain your current rank, and be granted another thirty-day seal on your current medal.${prompt};
However, any work you have done during the past evaluation period towards the procurement of the next medal will become null and void.${prompt};
Please consider carefully your options before making this important decision.${prompt};
Done. Your medal has been given a new magic seal.${prompt};
Oh yes, and please note that you will not be eligible for another evaluation for ${choice: 7}[five days/one hour] (Earth time).${prompt};
You are currently in possession of the most prestigious Campaign medal we have to offer.;
The Kingdom of San d'Oria has the utmost faith in you, and shall support you in any endeavor you choose to undertake.${prompt};

Business with Nicolaus of the Mythril Musketeers, you say?${prompt};
Well, if it isn't ${name-player}.;
How may I be of service to you today?${prompt};
You wished to see me about something?${prompt};
It's alright, Gentle Tiger. Please, leave us.${prompt};
Hmmm... Erlene...${prompt};
So Professor Schultz has gone and disappeared unannounced yet again, has he?${prompt};
He has always been quite the enthusiast for trying out new techniques in private.;
Why, I still recall one of his previous disappearing acts.;
One moment he was standing right before my eyes and the next he was gone, after calling forth one of those “storms” of his.${prompt};
The march of time must have been somehow different in...well, wherever he was.${prompt};
He claims he intended to be gone for only a short while. And yet some three weeks passed with no sign of his return.;
Caused quite the ruckus among the people here, it did.${prompt};
As Erlene properly informed you, in the end it was I who stumbled upon the professor.${prompt};
I simply visited his residence to search for some clue as to his whereabouts.${prompt};
It was then that I saw the “storm” formulation posted out on the wall.;
And I became convinced that he had never even left the comfort of his own quarters.${prompt};
I proceeded to call out his name, not hiding my agitation.${prompt};
And sure enough, the good professor materialized right there, in quiet contemplation before his chessboard.${prompt};
Did Erlene happen to mention anything else in regards to Professor Schultz?${prompt};
Reconnaissance, eh? So then, he seeks to gather intelligence on the Beastman Confederate's movements.${prompt};
It is no doubt the Quadav Shieldwarriors that have stirred his concern.${prompt};
In which case, it is most probable that he has headed for the Derfland Front.${prompt};
That front extends northeast from Pashhow Marshlands to the Rolanberry Fields, and then farther north still to Vunkerl Inlet.${prompt};
But that is just my best guess...;
Using his art to conceal himself when he seeks privacy is one thing, but to be surrounded by enemies deep within hostile territory...;
That is truly a matter for grave concern.${prompt};
Perhaps it would be prudent to go and search for one of the professor's “storms.” Under the strictest of caution, naturally.${prompt};
Has the professor been located?${prompt};
What was that about Rolanberry...? And Pashhow...?${prompt};
Oh, what ever shall I do...;
The deadline for my discourse draws near and I have yet to even gather the proper materials.${prompt};
Greetings. May I help you?;
Ah, a pupil of the Schultz school, I see.${prompt};
In which case, may I be so bold as to inquire why you are dressed in such a manner?;
You would do well to consider the reputation of your school and fellow students before donning such garb in public.${prompt};
Actually...${prompt};
Would you perhaps be interested in obtaining some appropriate attire for yourself?;
It just so happens that I have quite some influence in such matters.${prompt};
I regret, however, that I cannot offer up my services entirely free of charge.;
"I'm sure in the course of your studies you've become familiar with the ""Give and Take"" school of economics.${prompt}";
It is decided, then. I shall procure the garments for you.;
In return, I would ask that you assist me with my current assignment.${prompt};
I say assignment, but I assure you it is no significant charge.;
Simply one of those trivial and menial tasks which form the underpinnings of our beloved scholasticism.${prompt};
It's just that given the ever-worsening state of affairs with the ongoing war and all, this assignment has become considerably more difficult than when the senior pupils were required to complete it.${prompt};
No, no. It wouldn't be cheating, I assure you.;
There are no rules governing methods of acquisition.${prompt};
It is just as the old texts teach us, and as the professor always says.;
“One hundred victories in as many battles does not a sage make. He who gains victory without confrontation is the true sage.”;
To obtain one's objective through minimum effort is most sublime!${prompt};
It sounds like a reasonable enough offer to me.;
So what do you say?${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Accept the offer.;
Decline the offer.${prompt};
I see. That is most...unfortunate.;
I suppose I will have to do it myself after all.${prompt};
Oh! Did somebody have a change of heart?;
Have you given some further consideration to my offer?${prompt};
Most delightful!;
Please, wait here. Just a moment!${prompt};
<Pant, pant>...;
Here we are, then. Now, if you would be so kind as to select one of the following.${prompt};
Which item are you interested in?;
${selection-lines};
Give me some time to mull it over.${prompt};
Ahhh, ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}. Classic!;
In that case, I must ask this of you. Listen carefully.${prompt};
I will require you to obtain and bring me ${keyitem-article: 1[2]} and...;
Are you sure it is ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} that you would like?${prompt};
Are you sure？;
${selection-lines};
Beyond a doubt.;
On second thought...${prompt};
No need to worry. I shall produce the attire, as per our agreement.;
You just see to getting those items we talked about.${prompt};
It was ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you were after, correct?${prompt};
Deliver those to me and that new garment is as good as yours!${prompt};
I'll get my hands on ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} while you are busying yourself rounding up those items.;
Go along, now. We both have some work to do.${prompt};
Perfect! This is it!;
With this, my assignment should pose no difficulty at all. Thank you, ${name-player}!${prompt};
I believe this is yours, then.;
Here is ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}, as promised.${prompt};
So? How do you like it?${prompt};
Superb!;
Well, that takes care of one assignment.${prompt};
Just to let you know. I have several assignments which I would be more than happy to receive your able assistance with.;
If you ever want to see about getting some more attire, just let me know.${prompt};
Uh-oh, I know that look!;
Somebody wants some more clothes. Am I right?;
Which means somebody wants to help me with my research! Right?${prompt};
I know, I know. I haven't gotten to where I am today by not being able to read people.;
So, what will it be this time, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Marvelous! That completes all of my assignments!${prompt};
${name-player}... I haven't the words to thank you!${prompt};
Hmmm... You don't quite seem...complete, yet. Something is still missing, to be sure.;
Unfortunately, I am fresh out of assignments for you to help me with.${prompt};
Hahaha! Haha! Ha! <cough>!;
Well, I was able to get through all of my assignments without any major hang-ups.;
I expect cleeear sailing from here on out. All thanks to you.;
I truly am most grateful!${prompt};
By the way, there is a certain type of material that cannot be obtained without fulfilling certain...requirements, first.;
Keep an eye out!${prompt};
Long time no see, ${name-player}.;
No doubt, news of the serial killings has already reached your ears. The victims number four, and counting...${prompt};
That is, of course, unless the Mythril Musketeers have anything to say about it.;
Orders to conduct an investigation have already been issued from above, or so I'm told.${prompt};
But to be honest, the Mythril Musketeers are a little short-handed at the moment.;
They could certainly do with your help again, ${name-player}.${prompt};
...Darksteel Hurricane?;
Are you absolutely positive?${prompt};
The most recent victim's post in the Department of Industry...${prompt};
The cruelly methodical manner in which he was slain...${prompt};
And lastly, the mark carved into his forehead.${prompt};
All of this strongly suggests Darksteel Hurricane's involvement.${prompt};
Curses! But nothing has been heard of that cold-blooded killer for years!${prompt};
It's not uncommon for criminals to go into hiding for a time, waiting for the authorities to slip into complacency.${prompt};
Hm... How fares the investigation?${prompt};
...I fear there is little to report at present.;
Time has scarcely elapsed since the investigation orders were issued.${prompt};
Is that so...?;
I'm inclined to believe differently.${prompt};
Well do I know of the circumstances which led to the Mythril Musketeers being relieved of its customary role as the president's personal escort, and truly do I empathize with your desire to rid your unit of the burden of ignominy.${prompt};
But it cannot be denied that your unit is severely undermanned for an undertaking of this magnitude.;
Therefore, I offer you the full cooperation of my First Brigade.${prompt};
...${prompt};
I was under the impression that the First Brigade had been assigned the security of His Excellency the President in our stead.${prompt};
A superfluous concern. A good half of my forty soldiers can easily be spared for the investigative effort without compromising the president's safety.${prompt};
...We are grateful for your offer.${prompt};
One more thing.${prompt};
There is a theory which explains how Darksteel Hurricane was able to evade capture during his previous reign of terror.;
That is, the presence of an informant--a traitor within our ranks.${prompt};
Be careful whom you privilege with access to classified information.${prompt};
Your concern couldn't be more misplaced.;
The bond of mythril my people share is stronger than that of any steel. I trust each and every one of them with my life.${prompt};
Hahaha, that is most reassuring.;
Very well then. I will set my people to work at once.${prompt};
“Full cooperation”? Pshaw...;
That's one thinly veiled war declaration if you ask my humble opinion.${prompt};
I'm sorry... All of this is my doing...${prompt};
Don't pay it any mind, Five Moons.;
All we have to do is locate and apprehend the killer before those novice investigators do--as simple an operation as they come.${prompt};
You're right. It's the least I can do to repay the president for the kindness he showed me.${prompt};
That's more like the old Five Moons!;
Let's go knock that Iron Musketeers captain off his gilded saddle!${prompt};
Captain, I've been meaning to ask you about your ailment.;
Have your bouts of dizziness abated?${prompt};
I stand before you, don't I?;
There'll be time enough later to fret over my health.${prompt};
Best we focus all our efforts now on capturing our man before the First Division can get their ambitious hands on him.${prompt};
Exploit all information networks to the fullest extent, be it underworld or beastman, and spare no coin to procure the intelligence we need.;
The operation is commenced!${prompt};
A moment, Captain.;
There's one thing I'd like to ascertain before our investigation begins in earnest.${prompt};
As Captain Bartholomaus mentioned earlier, no incident linked to Darksteel Hurricane has occurred in years.${prompt};
So, why now? Why make a return to the fray now, when the climate of discontent during the recent Galkan uprising would've been infinitely more auspicious to his cause?${prompt};
Captain... I must confess to being plagued with similar doubts.${prompt};
The Darksteel Hurricane of old exclusively targeted high-ranking officials--those who'd only dare travel in the company of a small army.${prompt};
But this time, among the victims are government officers of no notable standing and even family members who were unfortunate enough to witness the unspeakable deed.;
This indiscriminate slaughter of innocent citizens tells me that something is sorely amiss.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Captain, could our suspect in fact be a copycat, rather than the real Darksteel Hurricane?${prompt};
All possibilities must be taken into consideration.${prompt};
But now is the time for action, not speculation.;
Lives may be lost while we stand here dwelling on inconsequential details.${prompt};
Yes, ma'am!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Debug: Do you wish to loop?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Uwaaah! Goddess have mercy!${prompt};
Oh, it's just you, ${name-player}...;
Don't sneak up on me like that.${prompt};
H-hey, don't get the wrong idea now. It's not like I'm afraid of having a run-in with Darksteel Hurricane or anything. As a matter of fact, I'd welcome the opportunity to bump into that despicable fiend in a dark alley. Y-yeah...that's right. A-and when I do, I'll send him to dreamland with an authentic Galkan chokehold. He'll be down for the count before he even has a chance to fumble for the hilt of his razor-sharp, blood-stained blade that's rumored to slice through limbs as if they were pumpkin pie...;
Ahaha...ha... <Ulp>...${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}. How goes the investigation?;
Were you able to unearth any clues pointing towards Darksteel Hurricane?${prompt};
I see. Impressive detective work as always, ${name-player}.;
Now, contingent upon the manner of intelligence we acquire from Blatherix...${prompt};
Hm? What's this talk of Goblins, you ask?;
Well, determining the suspect's appearance and characteristics is but the beginning. Narrowing down his location is the next logical step.;
For this, I've a mind to tap into the Goblins' expansive information network.${prompt};
You've already acquainted yourself with Blatherix, if I'm not mistaken?${prompt};
In that case, I'd be most obliged if you could seek him out and see if he can offer us anything on Darksteel Hurricane.;
I'd see to it myself, but there're still a few leads that I'd like to verify, preferably sooner than later.${prompt};
Hm? Searchin' for one Darksteel Hurricane, are we? The fellow that's been makin' headlines for all the wrong reasons?;
Sounds kinda dangerous to me, but business is business. So, whatcha got on him so far?${prompt};
Uh huh, uh huh...;
Goes around hidin' his forehead...decked out in darksteel armor...wields a great sword...${prompt};
Hmm... I could've sworn seein'...;
No, wait... I've gotten my swords all mixed up.${prompt};
Sorry buddy, but I got zilch for you this time.${prompt};
But I know guys--fellow Gobbies in the information network--who might have whatcha lookin' for.${prompt};
Today's your lucky day.;
We're meetin' in a bit, so you can tag along.${prompt};
There's just one teeny-weeny little problem, though.;
It's a Gobbies-only meetin', and no outsider who's filched a gander has ever been allowed to walk out in one piece.${prompt};
But if we use “Goblin Dust”...;
Yeah, that might just work.${prompt};
Get it? Got it? Good!${prompt};
Things sure have taken a turn for the worse around here of late.;
That's why everyone is closing up shop.${prompt};
The Brilioth Estate lies in the residential area. They are certainly the most notable family of dancers in these parts.${prompt};
They say the only daughter, Laila, is doing her dancer training now under the strict tutelage of her mother.${prompt};
Have you heard the rumors? There have been several sightings of these so-called “maws” outside the city.;
People are saying they may have been unleashed by the beasthordes!${prompt};
All accounts claim that they float just above ground, wreathing about, with gaping mouths like great voids that never shut...;
It gives me the chills just to think about it.${prompt};
An enormous comet is visible in the night sky as of late.${prompt};
I'm not quite sure why, but whenever I see a comet like that, it just puts a flutter in my chest.${prompt};
I'll admit, I wasn't sure how things would turn out when Selbina suddenly declared its independence.${prompt};
Senator Werner dispatched the Republican Legion and took control of the situation with such incredible speed.;
Even the president himself was amazed by the senator's show of skill.${prompt};
There's a mining spot in Grauberg where you can dig up some very good quality crystals.${prompt};
Apparently the Quadav Shieldwarriors will stop at nothing to gain control of mining resources.;
That's the reason for the continuing conflict between them and the Republic.${prompt};
Before the onset of war, President Prien rallied the strong support of the Galkan citizenry.;
That was the key to his winning the election.${prompt};
But it seems his campaign promises of improving living standards have been complicated by the outbreak of hostilities.${prompt};
I'm a huge fan of Laila's dancing! She's such an artist!${prompt};
Everyone agrees that she is a child prodigy. It's undeniable!${prompt};
Unfortunately, she's also famous for not signing autographs.;
Promise if you ever get one, you'll give it to me!${prompt};
Due to the encroaching threat of the Quadav Shieldwarriors, entry to Southern Gustaberg is currently prohibited.;
The Republic appreciates your understanding.${prompt};
This facility is for the temporary imprisonment of beastman prisoners of war.;
For your own safety, you are advised to keep your distance.${prompt};
When the beasthordes sieged San d'Oria, President Prien wasted no time in putting the entire Republic on a wartime footing.${prompt};
In retrospect, it was certainly the right thing to do.;
If not for his unwavering leadership, we would most likely have begun the war well behind the already expanding beasthordes.${prompt};
The Allied Forces of Altana have been formed collectively by Jeuno and the three nations to combat the Beastman Confederate.${prompt};
We've no business in an alliance with Windurst, if you ask me. Those Windurstians are not to be trusted.;
Am I the only one who remembers the Elshimo Campaign!?${prompt};
You've heard what they say, that the heat of combat will make you see things you've never seen before?${prompt};
It's true...;
In battle I saw a...horrific monster. Not like any of the other beastmen. Covered in mangy black and white fur...${prompt};
At first, I thought it some kind of wicked Mithra. But no... That was no Mithra!${prompt};
I hear lots of people saying they wish they hadn't been born to witness such dark and troubled days.;
But I, for one, am glad I'm alive to witness this war.${prompt};
Undoubtedly there are hardships to be endured, but this is a heroic battle that will surely live on in our histories!;
I would count myself blessed to be able to see it through to completion!${prompt};
This here's as useful a chocobo as you'll ever see.;
Capable of anything from battle mount to messenger chocobo!${prompt};
Senator Werner is adamant about having a technologically advanced military.;
He even goes so far as to visit the Metalworks from time to time.${prompt};
It seems Chief Engineer Cid is extremely busy after taking up the additional post as head of the Gunpowder Room.${prompt};
Senator Werner was always adamant about having a technologically advanced military.;
He even used to go so far as to visit the Metalworks from time to time.${prompt};
The Galkan Bridge is currently closed to prevent infiltration by beastman spies.${prompt};
The Galkan Bridge should be reopened immediately. I don't know what the president could be thinking.;
He claims to have roots in the miner's faction, but just what does he think of the Galka in the mining district?${prompt};
It is times like this when I wish that Talekeeper Raogrimm were still around to carry us through.${prompt};
It has been almost ten years since Raogrimm disappeared in the wintry cold of the north.;
We can only pray that he is still alive...somewhere.${prompt};
The Metalworks have been placed under the jurisdiction of the military in order to develop and produce arms for the war.;
Neither townspeople nor low-ranking soldiers are permitted to enter.${prompt};
Mining activities were forced to a halt when a squadron of Quadav sieged the entrance to the Palborough Mines.${prompt};
Not to say that mining day after day is a bag of laughs, but having no work at all is even worse.;
Maybe I'll volunteer for the Legion...${prompt};
Do you know what a Sahagin is?${prompt};
You know, those fish-like beastmen.;
Their demolition tactics have reduced Port Bastok to a shadow of its former glory.;
The Third Division of the Republican Legion is working tirelessly to rebuild it.${prompt};
And the crushing defeat at Grauberg left even the Fourth Division nearly annihilated.;
At this rate, who knows what will become of our republic...${prompt};
This is the Freidrich Battery.;
It bears the name of President Freidrich, our great leader during the First Battle of Konschtat.${prompt};
The battery has been reinforced with the finest Bastokan artillery to repel the siege of the beasthordes.${prompt};
We Galka live some 200 years before setting off on our journey of rebirth.;
But none of us wish to embark on that journey now. Not with the fate of our nation, and world, so unsure.${prompt};
At the battle of Vunkerl Inlet, the Republican Legion's Third Division encountered a gigas raiding party approaching by sea.${prompt};
The fiends eventually made landfall, but their advance was stopped cold by the brilliant tactics of Legatus Invincible Shield.;
No doubt his military genius will become the stuff of legend.${prompt};
Most people wouldn't agree with me, but I'm glad to be alive in this age of strife.;

Return.${prompt};
To plan successful battle strategies, current intelligence is essential. However, in this time of limited resources, it is impossible for my organization to collect all the information our nation requires.${prompt};
And this is why we work closely with other sectors within the army. Reconnaissance operations performed by ${choice-player-gender}[men/women] such as yourself provide us with valuable data on the enemy, thus enabling our leaders to select the best courses of action.${prompt};
By viewing this map, you can learn important information regarding each area within the Quon and Mindartia theaters. This includes area influence, area control, area defense, and area resources, among other things.${prompt};
The Allied War Council in Jeuno has deemed this information, as well as information regarding the morale and prosperity of each nation, open to all members of the Allied Forces of Altana.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}This information can be viewed at any time by opening the Allied Campaign map and moving the cursor over various locations.;
However, to ensure another army does not receive an unfair advantage on the battlefield, information dealing with national funding and strategies is well protected by each respective nation, and rarely made available to even those who serve under their flag.${prompt};
A nation's reconnaissance level indicates its current intel-gathering capabilities.${prompt};
The higher the level, the more plentiful and detailed the information we can offer you. In extreme cases, we may even be allowed to give you insight into our nation's battle strategies.${prompt};
However, without a constant flow of new intelligence, a nation's reconnaissance level will gradually fall. That is why we must rely on volunteers like you to keep us in the light!${prompt};

We have an assailant's unknown method of entry, and a victim slain in the dark...${prompt};
Perhaps the Chief Engineer could construct a machine to calculate the possible vectors and points of--${prompt};
Oh, I'm awfully sorry!;
I've been so focused on the mystery behind Senator Werner's assassination...${prompt};
You see, I happened to be eavesdro--er, I happened to overhear a conversation between some Mythril Musketeers...${prompt};
Progress report.${prompt};
Nothing new.;
I've discovered no recalcitrant witnesses, no conflicting evidence on the senator's movements...${prompt};
You spoke again with the guard who discovered the body?${prompt};
The details of his report remain unchanged.${prompt};
He insists that this room had been locked since the morning, and was empty when he checked inside during his patrol--moments before the senator entered.${prompt};
The guard you speak of is honest to a fault. We have no reason to doubt his testimony.${prompt};
Then we can assume the crime scene was unviolated at the time the body was discovered?${prompt};
How in Altana's name did this murderous wraith slip in and out unnoticed...?${prompt};
There's one other thing that seems out of place here.${prompt};
Out with it, Nicolaus.${prompt};
It goes back to the report from the first guard...${prompt};
He stated the following:${prompt};
“I heard the senator's cry, and ran to investigate. I was obliged to break the door open in order to enter the room.”${prompt};
He went on to mention “pitch blackness” when he described the situation within.${prompt};
Why didn't the senator light the lantern?${prompt};
...!${prompt};
Is it possible he was attacked before he had the chance?${prompt};
If that were true, then the body would have been found over here, where the tools for lighting the lantern are located.${prompt};
However, it appears that the senator walked into the center of the room, without touching those tools at all.${prompt};
Why would he have gone so far into the room without a light by which to see?${prompt};
That is unusual.;
There were no signs that the body was moved, either.;
We can only assume that he blundered through the dark of his own accord.${prompt};
Perhaps Senator Werner was fleeing from his attacker before he was stabbed...although the guard reported only a single cry.${prompt};
One presumes he cried out the moment his assailant plunged home the dagger.${prompt};
A murderous wraith, and a victim slain in the dark...${prompt};
What do you make of this, Nicolaus?${prompt};
I honestly couldn't say.;
I have several theories, but I need more information to make a final judgment...${prompt};
I used to study in the same classes as Mythril Musketeer Nicolaus.${prompt};
Even back then, he was famous among the students as the sleuth who solved mysteries like the “Case of the Vanishing Grimoire” and the “Case of the Missing Professor.”${prompt};
And yet this case has even Nicolaus stumped...;
I guess that's why I've become so obsessed with it.${prompt};
Now, where was I...?;
Ah yes, we must consider the surface area of the floor, and the potential speed of the fleeing assassin...${prompt};
...?;
Who goes there!?${prompt};
A child?;
This is no place for games, little one.${prompt};
C-C-Captain K-K-Klara...!${prompt};
I, um, you see...;
I'm not here to play...${prompt};
Then why are you here?${prompt};
I-I-I...;
Oh boy...${prompt};
(I can't believe Mythril Musketeer Captain Klara is talking to me...!)${prompt};
Not about to break under interrogation, are we?${prompt};
Well, just see that you don't come sneaking in here again, okay?${prompt};
Y-y-yes, ma'am...;
Is something amiss, Captain?${prompt};
That child was poking around in Chief Engineer Cid's laboratory--the room where Senator Werner was assassinated.${prompt};
He what!? That's not possible...${prompt};
Yes, no one here is to blame.;
Not the sentries. Not the guards.;
No one is at fault...${prompt};
I've been alert the entire time.;
How did he get in there...?${prompt};
The president has released a statement regarding Senator Werner's assassination.${prompt};
It contained a message to the assassin: “You will not elude the grip of the Mythril Musketeers!”${prompt};
You want to know how I snuck into the Metalworks?${prompt};
There was a guard at the entrance, so I crawled in through the ventilation shaft.${prompt};
What were you thinking, Pagdako?${prompt};
Your recklessness could have gotten you hurt.${prompt};
But...${prompt};
But I've heard so many Humes saying that maybe Elder Werei and Gumbah were responsible for the Senator's death!${prompt};
I thought if I could find the real culprit, their names would be cleared.${prompt};
Is that what they're saying?;
Those Humes will take any opportunity to drag us down...!${prompt};
I'll admit, there may be a few individuals among the Galkan community that didn't shed a tear at the senator's death. But that doesn't mean we'd stoop to murder.${prompt};
And I'm ashamed as a fellow Bastokan that any would accuse your elders of such.${prompt};
Elder Werei!${prompt};
Gumbah!${prompt};
And Mythril Musketeer Volker!${prompt};
The charge for inciting civil unrest has been dropped.;
There's no need for you to continue your...investigations.${prompt};
That's great news!${prompt};
Did you keep up your sword practice while I was gone?${prompt};
Things are back to normal, I guess...${prompt};
President's dog! You think you can just waltz in here after accusing our elders of such foul deeds...!?;
Calm yourself.;
This man is not one of the troops who arrested us.;
And he was gracious enough to escort us this far, knowing full well the reception he would receive.${prompt};
Though it hardly begins to address this injustice, I apologize for the affront against your elders.${prompt};
Hmph.;
I defer to Gumbah's wishes. This time.${prompt};
Let us be on our way.${prompt};
Don't fall behind in your training, Pagdako.${prompt};
(This Volker is a man to be watched. He may one day be a leader that both Hume and Galka can follow...so unlike his uncle Ulrich.)${prompt};
Hm?;
Ah, the informant.${prompt};
It appears that the weapons found in Grauberg were so old as to be completely unusable.${prompt};
Have you ever heard of a race called the Antica?${prompt};
They are antlike beastmen that nest in the Kuzotz region--the former homeland of the Galka.${prompt};
Those weapons belonged to Galka slain by the Antica, many moons past.;
Werei and Gumbah kept them in that cave as a tribute to the fallen.${prompt};
Losing a companion to war is always painful, no matter how many times you experience it.;
After losing an entire homeland, not to mention countless friends, I can only imagine how deep the well of Galkan sadness runs...${prompt};
Volker!;
What is it? What's happened?${prompt};
The envoy escorting the San d'Orian ambassador, on his way to fill the diplomatic post here in Bastok, has fallen prey to a Quadav attack!${prompt};
Baronet Dieuler!?${prompt};
I'm afraid so.;
According to the squire who managed to break free, the ambassador was taken into a mine shaft that has an entrance in the Pashhow Marshlands.${prompt};
A mine shaft?;
Then we must set out before they have a chance to flee too deep into the tunnels.${prompt};
There's a Goblin here in town by the name of Blatherix who has knowledge of the mining complex.;
I've sent Nicolaus to speak with him.${prompt};
The captain has ordered you and Zeid to launch a rescue mission at once.${prompt};
Understood.;
We leave immediately!${prompt};
I'm so glad Elder Werei and Gumbah are free from those horrible accusations.${prompt};
But now the Mythril Musketeers are talking about Goblins and mine shafts.;
What could have gone wrong now...?${prompt};
I'm a trader.;
You got anythin' to trade?${prompt};
Hm?;
You want information about the Quadav mine in the Pashhow Marshlands?${prompt};
You bring me 30 ${item-plural: 1[2]}, and we'll talk.;
Or maybe I'll loosen my tongue for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};
A Quadav mine in the Pashhow Marshlands?;
Now you're talkin'!;
Well, now I'm talkin', to be more accurate.${prompt};
There's an entrance to a mine shaft in the Pashhow Marshlands.;
You'll need ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to open the door.${prompt};
It just so happens I have ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} you can have.;
It'll break when you use it, so make sure you know what you're doin'.${prompt};
There's an entrance to a mine shaft in the Pashhow Marshlands.;
You'll need ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} to open the door.${prompt};
You need another ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};
No freebies this time.;
I hear you assisted in the rescue of a San d'Orian ambassador!;
Captain Klara will see you now.${prompt};
!!!;
I, er, I was just examining the architecture here!${prompt};
Yes, most fascinating.;
Well, I mustn't dawdle--there's work to be done!${prompt};
A Tonberry!?${prompt};
And similar assassinations have plagued San d'Oria in recent months?${prompt};
So Ambassador Dieuler tells me.;
The string of murders in the Elvaan capital has been attributed to Tonberry agents.${prompt};
The ambassador was kind enough to examine the senator's body for us...${prompt};
It appears the stab wounds were practically identical to the ones suffered by the San d'Orian victims.${prompt};
And the Tonberries' targets were all knights that have warned of the true danger posed by the beastman armies since before the war began.;
Much as President Prien and Senator Werner have attempted to do.${prompt};
It seems we have our culprit, then.;
But there are still two mysteries left to solve.${prompt};
The method of entry, and the location of the body...${prompt};
Ah, the ambassador's savior.;
If you could just wait over there until--${prompt};
Hm?;
You can explain what happened to the senator? Well, we'd love to hear your theory.${prompt};
Zeid.${prompt};
Let's start with the first mystery.${prompt};
How did the assassin enter a locked room?${prompt};
The assassin entered through...;
${selection-lines};
...the door.;
...the window.;
...the ventilation shaft.${prompt};
The door was watched by the guard.;
No one could have entered through that route.${prompt};
An interesting theory...except this room has no windows.${prompt};
The ventilation shaft...?${prompt};
That's how the Galkan child was able to enter the laboratory undetected?${prompt};
That makes sense.;
A Tonberry would be small enough to make use of the same route.${prompt};
It appears entering the room was the least of the assassin's concerns...${prompt};
On to the second mystery.${prompt};
How do you explain the location of the body, and the darkness in which it was found?${prompt};
The body was found in darkness because...;
${selection-lines};
...the senator did not light the lantern.;
...the assassin extinguished the light.;
...the guard extinguished the light.${prompt};
The guard broke into the room immediately after hearing the senator's cry. I highly doubt the assassin had the time to do more than make his escape.${prompt};
You doubt the guard's story?;
Other guards rushed to the scene soon after the door was opened. There could not have been time for the first guard to extinguish the lantern.${prompt};
You say the senator chose not to light the lantern?;
Why would he walk around in the dark?${prompt};
He didn't light the lantern because...;
${selection-lines};
...he preferred the darkness.;
...he was distracted.${prompt};
He...preferred the darkness?;
What do you mean by that?${prompt};
If you have no answer to that question, perhaps your reasoning is flawed.${prompt};
He was distracted?;
What would so consume his attention that he wouldn't light the lantern first?${prompt};
I think I understand.${prompt};
I once read a book of lore that described how a Tonberry would place a lantern on the floor to distract his victim, while the assassin positioned himself for the kill...${prompt};
...!${prompt};
The Tonberry likely placed his lantern at the far end of the room, then simply waited somewhere out of sight.${prompt};
When the senator entered and approached the mysterious light, he was attacked from behind!${prompt};
The door was probably locked by the assassin to buy time for his escape.${prompt};
While the guard was occupied with a locked door, the Tonberry sheathed his knife, picked up his lantern, and disappeared through the ventilation shaft before the alarm was fully raised.${prompt};
It's also possible that the assassin merely hid within the shaft until the lockdown on the Metalworks was lifted...${prompt};
Even with such planning, the lack of blood stains anywhere but near the victim speaks highly of the assailant's skill.${prompt};
So, that's how it happened...${prompt};
An assassin sent by our enemies seems the most likely theory...;
However, it is said that Tonberries seldom forge alliances.${prompt};
Has the Beastman Confederate's influence spread so far?;
Or perhaps...?${prompt};
There are still many details left to uncover.${prompt};
Zeid. Volker.;
Continue the investigation.${prompt};
What is your name?${prompt};
${name-player}, is it?;
You have performed a valuable duty here today.;
First and foremost, you are to be rewarded for your courage in assisting the ambassador.${prompt};
Secondly, your insight has shed light on what seemed an unsolvable investigation.;
The Republic thanks you.${prompt};
That child crawled in through the ventilation shaft!?;
Well, at least my pay won't suffer this time...${prompt};
Hm?;
Back again...?${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}. Just the ${choice-player-gender}[gentleman/lady] I wanted to see.${prompt};
There is something we would like to ask you regarding your relationship with the late Senator Werner.;
Would you accompany me, please?${prompt};
${name-player} is here to see you, Captain.${prompt};
Thank you, Nicolaus.${prompt};
Zeid and Volker's investigation turned up a link between you and the senator.;
I think you have some explaining to do.${prompt};
So, this interesting turn of events actually put you in the employ of Senator Werner...${prompt};
And the senator's plans for the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} you retrieved from the Goblin?;
You were left in the dark as to his intent?${prompt};
I see...${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} in question was found during a search of the late senator's office.${prompt};
This instrument is used as a tool to communicate with the Antica--the beastmen that inhabit the desert region of Kuzotz.${prompt};
We believe it is connected somehow with Senator Werner's assassination.${prompt};
The senator had hired the services of a certain mercenary organization.;
Engelhart--the man who acted as an intermediary between you and Senator Werner--is one of these hired soldiers.${prompt};
And mistakenly believed to be a part of this organization, you were sent to acquire the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};
It has also come to our attention that you were threatened by Chairman Pale Eagle.${prompt};
Can you substantiate that claim?${prompt};
Hm, you say this note was pressed into your hand by a Galka unknown to you?${prompt};
This is valuable evidence.;
If we have the letter examined, we may be able to determine the author.${prompt};
If that note has anything to do with Chairman Pale Eagle, then it becomes evidence in the conspiracy case to incite unrest among the Galkan citizens.${prompt};
In which case, I request said evidence be surrendered to the military police.${prompt};
Conspiracy case!?;
Gumbah and Werei were absolved of all charges! I thought that matter had been laid to rest!${prompt};
Not completely.;
That is why I insist on attending these impromptu hearings.${prompt};
Well, this is a quandary...;
How shall we handle this, Captain?${prompt};
Officer Dieter.;
Though our objectives differ, we share our duty to serve the Republic. I have no intention of withholding valuable information.${prompt};
However, this note may be pivotal in our investigation. We must have the writing examined immediately.${prompt};
If, in spite of our situation, you feel the need to appropriate the evidence, then I must insist that you lodge an official, written request.${prompt};
Very well.;
You will be hearing from my superior.${prompt};
Your cooperation is appreciated.;
If there is anything else you recall, please contact the Mythril Musketeers.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Ah...aren't you the one who assisted Nicolaus in solving the mysteries behind Senator Werner's death?${prompt};
It seems like the Mythril Musketeers have their hands full dealing with the Security Office and the military police...${prompt};
(Ah!)${prompt};
I-I was just passing through!${prompt};
I r-really must be going!${prompt};
Who would've thought that the music shop owner belonged to some secret mercenary organization...?${prompt};
Wh-what is it, ${name-player}?;
I'm a little occupied right now...${prompt};
Were you followed?${prompt};
Of course not.;
The Mythril Musketeers have yet to learn of my involvement.${prompt};
What of the base in the Eldieme--?${prompt};
Lower your voice!${prompt};
The base is secure.;
If we deal with matters promptly, there won't be a problem.${prompt};
Tread carefully.${prompt};
I always do.${prompt};
The Mythril Musketeers hauled me in for questioning.;
You didn't have anything to do with that, did you?${prompt};
You are free to pass.;
Captain Klara is waiting.${prompt};
The statement made by Engelhart matches those of the mercenaries we detained.;
It appears you were telling the truth.${prompt};
To be honest, until now we weren't completely convinced by your tale of coincidences.${prompt};
And I would warn you against sticking your neck out where it's likely to be chopped off...but it seems your brand of recklessness was necessary to solve this case.${prompt};
Perhaps I should have given you command of the investigation in the first place...${prompt};
Merely a jest, Volker.${prompt};
Ah, Volker and Zeid.;
How goes the investigation?${prompt};
President Prien!;
Now that you ask, there are certain matters involving the Antica...${prompt};
...!${prompt};
Mister President, perhaps I can be of assistance here...${prompt};
Considering present company, perhaps we should postpone this discussion?${prompt};
That won't be necessary.;
There is nothing to hide.${prompt};
This way please, Mister President, Chairman Pale Eagle...${prompt};
It was a plan proposed by Senator Werner following the assault on Port Bastok...${prompt};
The Antica!?${prompt};
Correct.;
Just think of the possibilities an army with unbreakable morale and overwhelming numbers could provide.${prompt};
Unthinkable.;
You must be aware of the horrors the Galkan people have suffered at the hands of those creatures.${prompt};
I must side with the chairman on this.${prompt};
It may well be possible to manipulate the Antica with the technology you describe--especially if the Chief Engineer lends you his expertise.${prompt};
However, even if you managed such a feat, what if they were to ever break free of your control? The risks are too high.${prompt};
With the fate that lies before us, how can you not be prepared to take that risk!?${prompt};
The invincible armada of the third division--the pride of the Republic--is still languishing in an unrepaired port, while the Fighting Fourth has been all but decimated in the Battle of Grauberg.${prompt};
Do you mean to sit idly by as devastation rains upon us!?${prompt};
I understand your concerns, Senator.;
However, please consider the situation.${prompt};
Should this suggestion become public knowledge, can you imagine the outcry from our Galkan citizens?${prompt};
I shall speak plainly, President Prien.;
Are we really in a position to plan around the delicate feelings of the Galka?${prompt};
Senator!${prompt};
Simply cowering in fear of the enemy will do nothing to improve our fortunes in this war.${prompt};
The senator went ahead with his plan regardless, I see...${prompt};
President Prien...${prompt};
Mister President!;
I must speak with you regarding the recent Republic Defense Council and Chairman Pale Eagle's...${prompt};
You are free to voice your concerns. Continue.${prompt};
Senator of Mining, Derek Karst, requests a meeting of department representatives to officially dismiss Chairman Pale Eagle from his position of office!${prompt};
We have confirmed the threats made by the chairman against the Senator of Defense.${prompt};
That information should still be under investigation...${prompt};
We have just had word from the Security Office that the writing in ${name-player}'s note matches that of the chairman's secretary.${prompt};
However, we discovered that the secretary had already been apprehended by the Second Division Military Police.${prompt};
Already apprehended?${prompt};
Yes, Captain.;
Apparently the secretary admitted to obstructing Senator Werner's movements.${prompt};
...!${prompt};
The military police confirmed our evidence without our authorization!?;
And they call it the Security Office...${prompt};
There are many in the Republic who supported the late senator.;
They probably wish to deal with the matter internally.${prompt};
Then we must act quickly.;
But now we have this business with Senator Karst and the chairman's resignation--we have no way of preventing knowledge of this situation from reaching the general public...${prompt};
(Dammit...!)${prompt};
(Does my father even realize how this makes me look!?)${prompt};
The investigation committee has issued a summons for Chairman Pale Eagle's immediate presence...${prompt};
Very well.;
I will present myself before this committee without delay.${prompt};
Do not be concerned for me, President Prien.${prompt};
I shall accompany you.${prompt};
I have the utmost faith in you, Gwill...${prompt};
Senator Werner and Chairman Pale Eagle have sought to undermine each other at every opportunity...${prompt};
...${wait-36: 1};
Is it possible the Tonberry assassin was recruited as a pawn in our nation's political struggles?${prompt};
Nicolaus!;
What are you saying?${prompt};
It's...just a theory.${prompt};
Now is not the time to encourage such inflammatory speculation.${prompt};
I served under Chairman Pale Eagle when he held the position of legatus.;
There are still a good number of Galkan soldiers in the Republican Army that respect his word.${prompt};
And Senator Werner commanded a similar number of supporters, I would imagine.${prompt};
...${prompt};
The military police concern me the most.;
I only hope they refrain from further inciting the Galkan populace.${prompt};
I'm rather more worried about the meeting of department representatives.;
What could the senators be planning...?${prompt};
This talk is getting us nowhere.;
The most effective action we can take as Mythril Musketeers is to uncover the facts as soon as possible.${prompt};
I must return to guarding the president.;
Return to your duties!${prompt};
Yes, ma'am!${prompt};
You did well.;
Allow me to escort you outside.${prompt};
(Could Chairman Pale Eagle have been behind the assassination!?)${prompt};
(Imagine the uproar should this information reach the people!)${prompt};
(And now the military police and the senators seem to be acting deliberately to achieve such chaos...)${prompt};
(Matters have taken a dastardly turn!)${prompt};
Chief Sturm?${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
Y-you have me mistaken for someone else!${prompt};
How could Chairman Pale Eagle be a suspect in the assassination case?;
What is this nation coming to?${prompt};
By the way, I heard from Operations Division's chief of staff, Adelheid Sturm, that the Mythril Musketeers have employed you as an assistant detective.${prompt};
Even Captain Klara has come to rely on your talents, judging by how often she's asked for you by name.;
Keep up the great work!${prompt};
Ain't you the assistant detective working with the Mythril Musketeers?${prompt};
They're important customers of mine.;
Which means, now so are you...and I like to keep my customers happy.${prompt};
I got all sortsa junk and gossip to trade.;
Keep me in mind next time you're in town.${prompt};
Hey, soldier!;
You think you can sneak around behind my back and just jump into whatever trouble you feel like!?;
I oughta twist your neck for you.${prompt};
You're just lucky Captain Klara vouched for you!;
Even I wouldn't want to cross that hellcat!;
Gahahahaha!${prompt};
You can keep up this detective game, but make sure you keep an eye on the front lines!${prompt};

DEBUG:コンプ後です。${prompt};
Hey, have you heard? Some Quadavs have begun equipping a new type of armor that has our army completely baffled.${prompt};
It's supposed to be bulletproof.;
If this new armor were to be mass produced by the Quadav, we'd be in quite a tight spot. The issue's been causing mayhem in the Allied War Council.${prompt};
How do I know all this?${prompt};
I got the info through Ghemp, a mercenary mate of mine. He's got heavy connections in the military.${prompt};
There's no doubt about it. The marks left on the bullets recovered from the site show telltale signs of deflection. I hate to admit it, but those turtles now have the upper hand...${prompt};
If the army hadn't rejected your request for funding, you would have developed your own bulletproof armor by now. I thought your theory on shape being a factor in repelling bullets rather compelling...${prompt};
The council is filled with hard-headed fossils.${prompt};
Hey, Vareggo! How's work been?${prompt};
Things are well, thanks.;
No exciting developments to report, really, but that's nothing to complain about. In our line of work, you have to count your stars just to be alive.${prompt};
That's the spirit! Say, if you're not busy, we'd like your help with our work.${prompt};
We've recently been commissioned by the army to oversee production at the munitions factory, and need more hands.${prompt};
That's great news! This means you can finally put your smithing expertise to use, right?${prompt};
I suppose you could put it that way. The pay's nothing fancy, though.${prompt};
That's still wonderful news all the same. With all the advancements in weaponry being made by the beastmen, it's reassuring to have you two in charge.${prompt};
Actually, me and ${name-player} were talking about the new armor being used by the Quadav just now.${prompt};
Hmmm... You mean the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
What a coincidence! Ghemp and I were having the exact same conversation.${prompt};
The armor's strength does not rely on thickness or material alone--I'm convinced it's the contour that holds the key to its ability to deflect bullets...${prompt};
Excuse me if I'm wrong, but haven't we already had this conversation five times today? This is beginning to become an unhealthy obsession, Ghemp.${prompt};
It...it's a matter of grave importance to the security of the nation!;
If I could just get my hands on a sample, it'd be possible to analyze it and prove my bulletproofing theory correct...${prompt};
That's all well and good, but I reckon there's better gil to be had by developing a new weapon that'll penetrate the armor and selling the design to the army.${prompt};
Well, well, looks like I'm not the only one with an obsession...${prompt};
So, how about it? Would you be interested in finding me ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}? I'll make sure you're rewarded.${prompt};
I want the armor pieces so badly, I'm willing to part with my soul.${prompt};
Hey hey, hold your chocobos there, Ghemp!;
Y-you can't be serious about giving your soul away...${prompt};
Sure I can. I don't need it anymore.${prompt};
So, what do you say? Things could get a bit rough, but I would really appreciate your help.${prompt};
Go find the armor pieces for Ghemp?;
${selection-lines};
I could do with another soul...;
Nah, not interested.${prompt};
I knew I could count on you! I'll be waiting.${prompt};
That's a shame... I can't blame you for fearing for your own safety.;
But let me know if you change your mind.${prompt};
Ghemp wants you to bring ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Bring the items to me as soon as you acquire them, and I'll personally make the delivery to Ghemp, rain, hail, or shine.${prompt};
Oof! The weight is incredible! These are exactly what Ghemp wanted. Thank you so much.${prompt};
I'll deliver them to Ghemp immediately, and accept the reward on your behalf. Be sure to come back to collect it from me in a little while.${prompt};
Ghemp will be ecstatic to have these armor pieces.;
I'll be back with your reward soon, so come back here in a little while.${prompt};
Oh, you're back, ${name-player}. Ghemp said he wanted to give the reward to you in person, so please wait here while I go fetch him.${prompt};
You're a lifesaver, ${name-player}.;
The armor pieces are exactly what I was looking for...and in such great condition, too! Here, this is my soul as promised.${prompt};
It's a smithing instrument that was made for me by a traveling tool vendor who taught me my craft.${prompt};
But it does its job too well, almost to a fault. Relying too much on it jeopardizes my integrity as a master blacksmith. That's why I've decided to give it away.${prompt};
Oh, and one more thing. I examined the Quadav armor, and it's as I expected--a makeshift construction that deflects bullets.${prompt};
What we don't know, though, is whether it was accident or intent that made the armor bulletproof...${prompt};
Either way, nothing changes the fact that the Quadav now pose a greater threat than ever before.${prompt};
B-but, how are we to fight an enemy that is impervious to bullets?${prompt};
There's no reason for panic. After all, there's no such thing as impenetrable armor...${prompt};
At least not for our Garbenn! You've already thought up ways to make a gun shoot through the new Quadav armor, right?${prompt};
Yeah, it's possible to increase firepower by tweaking charge and bullet.;
After that, penetrating the turtle armor would be like poking a rapier into a yogurt cake. But... ${prompt};
But...what?${prompt};
I've been developing something else--a tempered steel axe that will slice right through entire ranks of Quadav! Well, that's exaggerating things a little...${prompt};
A well-aimed blow with a heavy, well-weighted axe head should smash apart rivets that hold together plates of armor, turning it into a dismantled heap on the ground.${prompt};
Even if the armor holds, the sheer force of the blow will not leave the wearer unscathed.${prompt};
Hmmm... Galkan soldiers like ourselves can wield battle axes with ease, so the idea is not without merit. But, why axes and not guns?${prompt};
You see...${prompt};
I detest projectile weapons.${prompt};
Garbenn, this matter is too serious to make decisions based on personal preferences!${prompt};
No... There is sense in what Garbenn is saying.${prompt};
Only a handful of Quadav will have the strength to don such heavy armor.;
In that case, if we let the strongest in their ranks weigh themselves down...${prompt};
And mobilize a Galkan strike team armed with enhanced battle axes to eliminate them as soon as they are sighted... Problem solved! ${prompt};
Who would have thought...${prompt};
Then it's decided! Garbenn, you continue developing those tempered steel battle axes, and I'll start working on a lightweight bulletproof armor that'll surpass anything those turtles have.${prompt};
Leave it to me, Ghemp. Just don't be too shocked when my axe pulverizes your armor like a chunk of rock salt!${prompt};
Haaa! We'll see who has the last laugh. My armor will stand up to all your pickaxes.${prompt};
Oooh, I bet you're planning to use that “revolutionary” shock-absorbing material of yours. A refresher course in introductory physics should be your first priority, my misguided friend!${prompt};
...${prompt};
Those two are always carrying on like that.${prompt};
But I know that beneath their cheerful exterior, they are dead serious about smithing.${prompt};
Ghemp and Garbenn chose to become smiths because they couldn't bear to see their mercenary friends fall in battle for want of decent armor.${prompt};
Armor made by soldiers for soldiers--that's the way it should be.;
I wonder if they'd be willing to take me on as an apprentice...${prompt};
I came here because I wanted to help in some way.${prompt};
I'm not in it for the gil, if that's what you're thinking.;
I want to become someone who is dependable and respected...like Ghemp and Garbenn.${prompt};
You wouldn't happen to be a fellow scholar, by any chance?;
The contents of these pages are beyond me, but perhaps you might glean something from them.;
They could be yours...for a nominal fee.${prompt};
You there, soldier. You've been sent up from the scouts division, yes?;
Well, let's not waste any time. Here, take this.${prompt};
Hmmm, it looks like you're packing a full load, there.;
A good scout should always keep light on his feet, you know.;
Come back when you've gotten rid of some of that excess.${prompt};
${selection-lines};
A fiend what?;
I'm good, thanks.${prompt};
Essentially, it's just a miniature recording device currently in the early stages of experimental use by the scouts division.${prompt};
When used in conjuction with a scout's ${color: 5}blank fiend plate${color: 1}, it allows for the automatic and hassle-free storage of surveillance data.${prompt};
That about covers it. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to take this ${color: 5}fiendtrapper${color: 1} and go and get the goods on those darn Quadav!${prompt};
I expected no less from an knowledgable scout such as yourself.;
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to take this device and find out what those Quadav are up to!${prompt};
I suggest that you get a move on. And may the Goddess watch over you.${prompt};
What is it? Were you able to capture some helpful footage of the enemy?;
In times such as these, surveillance can be the difference between victory or defeat.${prompt};
Since I have confirmed your findings, it is now on you to proceed directly to Hieronymus with that intel and report the particulars.${prompt};
I apologize for my frankness, but I am on duty.;
If your query is in regards to anything other than Campaign Ops, please direct it elsewhere.${prompt};
This is most excellent!;
You can even make out the individual scales of their vile skin!;
We can only hope you are able to secure more footage of this caliber.${prompt};
Unfortunately, I am afraid that this footage tells us nothing of import.;
High command will not consider the mission complete without more incriminating surveillance.${prompt};
While you're efforts are greatly appreciated, it is my understanding that we are seeking to obtain surveillance of slightly more...important Quadav.${prompt};
I was led to believe that you were a highly decorated hero.;
Surely you would consider it best to meet the demands laid forth by your superiors.${prompt};
We already have enough data on that breed of Quadav.;
High command has ordered that we expand our surveillance to cover the widest spectrum possible.${prompt};
Well done, scout!;
No doubt high command will be quite pleased with this wealth of information.;
This must be made known to Hieronymus immediately.${prompt};
I think we have enough footage here. You must hurry and seek audience with Hieronymus.;
Report your findings to him firsthand.${prompt};
Hey, you!;
Rumor has it you're pretty handy with that there brain of yours.;
So whaddya say? Wanna put it to use for your nation?${prompt};
Lend him your brain?;
${selection-lines};
That's what it's there for.;
He's not worthy.${prompt};
Figures. All brain and no brawn.${prompt};
Now you're talking. Here's how this works.;
I'm gonna input all of our latest intel into that head on your shoulders, and then you spit out an airtight strategy.;
Got it?${prompt};
All right, here we go. Our most up-to-date intel is as follows.${prompt};
...Never mind. We have no intel.;
That...can't be good.${prompt};

Hear me, my fellow Galka. For far too long have we lived under the oppressive rule of the Humes. In the name of their twisted justice, at this very moment one of our own is being accused of a crime he did not commit.${prompt};
We all know this hero's name, do we not?${prompt};
Pale Eagle!!!;
Will we stand by and watch as Pale Eagle suffers the same humiliation to which our comrades, Werei and Gumbah, were subjected?${prompt};
No!!! We will not!!!;
I thank you, my brothers.;
Your support is indispensable in this dark hour.${prompt};
It is time... Time for the Galkan race to rise up and break free from our shackles.${prompt};
Just like the time when the hero, Darksteel Hurricane, stood up against the tyranny of the Humes so many years ago!${prompt};
Hurrah!!!;
What is the meaning of this?;
Unauthorized public gatherings are strictly prohibited!${prompt};
I take it you're the leader of this rabble?;
Adjourn this illegal gathering immediately! Or else--${prompt};
Hm?${prompt};
You... I know your face...;
Why, you're a Mythril Musketeer! Explain yourself this instant!${prompt};
See for yourselves, my fellow Galka!${prompt};
This is the Humes' twisted notion of justice! Their mouths spew forth the law, while their hands reach for a blade!${prompt};
The ones who unjustly imprisoned Werei and Gumbah are none other than the self-proclaimed military police standing here before you!${prompt};
Scoundrels!${prompt};
Don't think we'll stand quietly by and let you military police dogs frame our respected Chairman Pale Eagle as well!${prompt};
S-stand down! Stand down, I say!;
Don't do anything stupid!${prompt};
That's enough fun and games.${prompt};
Zeid! I knew you'd come!${prompt};
!?;
Zeid!? What is the meaning of this?${prompt};
Mythril Musketeer Five Moons. You are under arrest for treason and slander.${prompt};
Is this a joke!? The ones who brought forth false accusations against Chairman Pale Eagle should be arrested, not I! Am I not right, Zeid?${prompt};
...${prompt};
Zeid...?${prompt};
This loose cannon of yours is a disgrace to the Mythril Musketeers. Our superiors will hear of this, make no mistake about it.${prompt};
Feel free to do as you please.${prompt};
Needless to say, considering his role as the ringleader, he'll be taken into our custody. I trust there will not be any objections.${prompt};
Zeid! Is there not a speck of Galkan pride left in you?${prompt};
Pride, you say?;
I have pride in what I do, not who I am.${prompt};
I can't believe I'm hearing this from you--a Galka!${prompt};
What is the source of this commotion?${prompt};
Your Excellency, this man has been arrested for inciting rebellious sentiments within young Galka.${prompt};
Hmm, this is disconcerting indeed.${prompt};
Why, this is a familiar face. If my memory serves me correctly, you are Mythril Musketeer Five M--${prompt};
Galagg!;
The name's Galagg, and don't you forget it!${prompt};
I'm warning you, Karst: This isn't over. We Galka will not stand idly by while the chairman has his honor defaced. Even if you lock me up, someone else will rise in my place and--${prompt};
Mind your manners before the senator!;
Ugh!${prompt};
That's enough, officer!;
Violence will not be tolerated, not even towards detainees and prisoners!${prompt};
I-I beg your pardon, Your Excellency.${prompt};
Now, Galagg, was it?${prompt};
I, Derek Karst, will speak with Chairman Pale Eagle in person and confirm the truth for myself. This, I solemnly promise.${prompt};
Take him away!${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}.${prompt};
I'm sorry you had to witness what just transpired.${prompt};
In an unfortunate turn of events, suspicion over the plot behind Senator Werner's assassination has been cast upon Chairman Pale Eagle.${prompt};
We Mythril Musketeers were given orders to conduct a preliminary investigation.${prompt};
While Five Moons had been observed voicing his belief in Chairman Pale Eagle's innocence with increasing fervor, no one thought much of it. Until one day he disappears from headquarters all together. The rest, well, you've seen with your own eyes.${prompt};
Nicolaus, we need to focus on the task at hand.${prompt};
With regards to the reason behind Five Moon's sudden change of heart, do we have anything to speculate upon?${prompt};
Actually, we found a book lying in his room--one that's been causing quite a stir recently.${prompt};
A book, you say?${prompt};
It's a chronicled account of the unsuccessful attempts to capture “Darksteel Hurricane,” the infamous assassin who shook the very foundation of the Republic several years back.${prompt};
It would appear that this Darksteel Hurricane has attained cult status as of late. He's idolized among the younger generation of Galka as a hero and role model.${prompt};
Of all people, they choose to idolize a murderer...;
Nicolaus, we're going.${prompt};
Now, if you'll excuse us, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Oh, it's you.;
You're looking for Captain Klara?${prompt};
She's receiving a guest right now. Senator Karst, in fact.${prompt};
I was specifically instructed not to let anyone through...but hey, it's you!${prompt};
Sir, I beseech you to reconsider.${prompt};
Chairman Pale Eagle hasn't yet been cleared of suspicion. Meeting with him alone under these circumstances would be ill-advised.${prompt};
I am not unmindful of your concern, Captain. But I must honor the promise I made to your man to seek out the truth for myself.${prompt};
If I cannot dissuade Your Excellency, please grant me permission to accompany you.${prompt};
While I appreciate your commitment, I cannot allow it. This meeting at Zegham Hill must be between only myself and the chairman.${prompt};
But sir, with beastman forces prowling the Gustaberg region, precautions must be taken--${prompt};
This discussion is over, Captain. This matter is to be kept in the strictest confidence.${prompt};
This applies to you too, adventurer.${prompt};
Y-Your Excellency...${prompt};
Captain! Is it true Five Moons is being detained by the military police!?${prompt};
I'm afraid so.${prompt};
The new Five Moons is a great deal more stubborn than the one we used to know. He has been maintaining his silence since arrest. Continuing to do so would be tantamount to admitting his own guilt.${prompt};
Damn it!${prompt};
Volker, where do you think you're going?${prompt};
I'm going to go slap some sense back into Five Moons and then bring him back.${prompt};
You'd only be wasting your time. Only Captain Klara has authorization from the military police to meet with Five Moons. Furthermore, it wouldn't be in their best interest to release him.${prompt};
Captain, what do you propose...${prompt};
Five Moon's charges are serious. If they stick, I would be forced to dismiss him from the Mythril Musketeers, to say nothing of the hefty sentence should he be convicted.${prompt};
If he does not break his silence--and soon--there's precious little I can do for him.${prompt};
Leave him be, Volker. He clearly has his sights set on martyrdom. There's no point going against that wish.${prompt};
Zeid! You, of all people...${prompt};
Hm... I just had a thought. Captain, if I may.${prompt};
If the allegations of Chairman Pale Eagle's involvement in the assassination is disproved, wouldn't the charges being brought against Five Moons be lightened, even if nullification is out of the question?${prompt};
...!${prompt};
${name-player}. I have a favor to ask of you.${prompt};
I want you to accompany Volker to Senator Karst's meeting with Chairman Pale Eagle.${prompt};
Captain...?${prompt};
Republican law recognizes the gravity of third-party evidence.${prompt};
Therefore, if any fruit comes of the secret meeting at Zegham Hill and the chairman's involvement in the assassination is disproved...${prompt};
Your presence as eyewitness may be pivotal in the case for Five Moons.${prompt};
Prepare for immediate departure, Volker. It was a mistake allowing the senator to leave unescorted. Should anything run afoul, protect His Excellency with your life.${prompt};
I must first attend to Five Moons.;
I will be right behind you, ${name-player}.${prompt};
If you're looking for Senator Karst, he's already left for his meeting with Chairman Pale Eagle at Zegham Hill in North Gustaberg.${prompt};
Terrible news! Five Moons has broken out of jail!${prompt};
I hate to imagine what would happen if we don't find him before the military police do. We're counting on you, Detective ${name-player}!${prompt};
Comrade Galagg!${prompt};
I've successfully detained my Hume superior officer in the Musketeer ranks!${prompt};
Good work, Comrade Ghioggo, and done most expeditiously. And what of our own?${prompt};
Regretfully, a small handful of our brothers refused to join the cause. They, too, have been detained as you ordered.${prompt};
That is most unfortunate...;
But those who don't know true freedom cannot be blamed for their actions. I will speak with them myself when the time is right.${prompt};
Five Moons!;
Cease this folly this instant!${prompt};
Volker...${prompt};
Can't you see that your actions serve only to smear shame upon Galkan honor?${prompt};
Listen to me. With Captain Klara's backing, we can make a direct appeal to the president. We have an honest chance of--${prompt};
!?;
Five Moons, is it your intention to detain me also?${prompt};
After all we've been through, to you, am I no different from all the other Humes!?${prompt};
Troubling news, Comrade Galagg!${prompt};
What is it, Comrade Dabem?${prompt};
We've just received word that our regiment patrolling North Gustaberg has been set upon by the Quadav Elite Guard, and is currently retreating for the capital.${prompt};
Hmph. That would be the regiment given to the care of Glenagg. It seems the task was beyond one with his meager experience.${prompt};
What are the enemy numbers?${prompt};
The Quadavs are estimated to be between two to three thousand shells strong, and are marching straight for the capital at this very moment!${prompt};
What!? B-but we have not more than a few units under our command that can be mobilized!${prompt};
What will we do, Comrade Galagg?${prompt};
Why, this is our long-awaited chance...${prompt};
Let the turtlebacks come in their tens of thousands--it makes no difference to us. We, the Galka, will repel their offensive and show the cowardly Humes the true meaning of courage!${prompt};
F-Five Moons...${prompt};
Chaaaaaarge!!!;
!!!;
Volker!${prompt};
Captain...!;
What was that thunderous explosion?${prompt};
The Quadav Shieldwarriors are bombarding us with their siege turrets.${prompt};
Siege turrets!?;
But how did they so quickly prepare for siege warfare?${prompt};
The siege turrets were stockpiled within a nearby abandoned mine. We must destroy them, or else the city will be reduced to piles of rubble.${prompt};
But, Five Moons is still--${prompt};
Leave him be. He has abandoned the Mythril Musketeers, and his welfare is no longer our concern.${prompt};
I truly understand how you feel, Volker, but we're racing against time.${prompt};
That bombardment was merely a preparatory discharge from no more than three turrets.${prompt};
That is not an unreasonable amount with which to deal for Five Moons and his outfit.${prompt};
While Five Moons holds back the enemy offensive, we make for the Ruhotz Silvermines. Zeid has reason to believe it is there that a great many more siege turrets have been stashed.${prompt};
I know not why the remaining turrets have yet to be included in the Quadav offensive, but I dread to imagine the carnage should they be brought to the battlefront.${prompt};
The siege turrets must be destroyed before they can be employed against us.${prompt};
Captain, how will this operation be conducted?${prompt};
The siege turrets are tautly lined with animal hide, making them extremely fire-resistant. We will need to use ignis powder to destroy them.${prompt};
Ignis powder...;
Definitely not something you learn about in alchemy class.${prompt};
Due to the not inconsiderable risk involved if the substance were to be placed in the hands of laymen, we will be recruiting the services of the Special Operations Squadron in this particular mission. No one can handle explosives as fleetly and safely as they.${prompt};
Special Operations Squadron...;
The situation is indeed grave when the “SOS” call is made. That leaves the matter of ignis powder procurement.${prompt};
The president himself is seeing to the release of ignis powder from the Metalworks' munitions storeroom.${prompt};
Captain, if I may be permitted to assist in its transportation? While I do not claim to be an expert on its application, my knowledge will surely be of some use in handling such a volatile substance.${prompt};
Permission granted.;
One can never take too many precautions when it comes to ignis powder.${prompt};
And ${name-player}, we will need your assistance also during the blasting operation.${prompt};
Operation members will regroup within the Ruhotz Silvermines, where the remaining siege turrets are hoarded.${prompt};
You'll be needing this key to gain entrance. We're relying on you, ${name-player}.${prompt};
Zeid, Nicolaus, Volker! With me!${prompt};
Ghioggo!;
Be strong, now! Stay with me!${prompt};
C-Comrade Galagg...;
Our deeds...this day...${prompt};
Yes, Ghioggo...;
On this glorious day, we restored pride and honor to the Galkan name. The tale of your valor will go down in history and be retold for all time.${prompt};
I'm happy...to hear that...${prompt};
Th...this can't be happening...${prompt};
Nooooooooo!!!;
If you're looking for the Mythril Musketeers, they've left to see to the deployment of the Special Ops crew. The captain is expecting you at the Ruhotz Silvermines, so off you go now.${prompt};
How many times do I have to tell you, he's not here! By now Comrade Galagg would have detained all Hume officers and seized all key facilities in the Republic.;
That rash young fool...;
Hurry and take me to him!;
!?;
What in the world!?${prompt};
Werei!${prompt};
The enemy was allowed to reach the city gate!?${prompt};
W-we were completely outnumbered. We don't know how much longer these gates will hold...${prompt};
...!${prompt};
Werei, look over there!${prompt};
Huh? The Humes have been set free!? Has something happened to Comrade Galagg?${prompt};
All of you, listen up and listen well! These Hume officers have been released from detainment.${prompt};
Be assured that I have not forgotten the ill feeling you hold towards the Humes.${prompt};
But no matter how little love there may be between our two races, Bastok is our homeland, built brick by brick with the blood and sweat of our displaced Galkan ancestors who crossed the seas in search of a safe haven.${prompt};
Now is the time to cast aside our differences and unite under one banner to protect our homeland!${prompt};
Hurrah!!!;
What're you loitering around here for? President Prien's about to make an official statement, so head over to the President's Office right now!${prompt};
...Thanks to your selfless display of courage, the greatest danger ever faced by our nation since its founding has successfully been averted.${prompt};
It is with supreme jubilation that I now stand before you and make this declaration: We have triumphed over the Quadav!${prompt};
But of course, this victory was not without cost. We must never forget our comrades who gave their lives in the line of duty, nor the innocent citizens who fell to the indiscriminate onslaught of the beastmen.${prompt};
Please join me now in a moment of silent prayer to the memory of those who are no longer with us...${prompt};
Thank you.${prompt};
I would now like to take this opportunity to make an announcement concerning a matter of great importance. I ask you all to listen well, and with open minds.${prompt};
The incident wherein Senator Werner was brutally murdered by a Tonberry assassin...${prompt};
I am deeply ashamed that suspicion behind the plot was falsely cast upon a law-abiding leading citizen like Chairman Pale Eagle.${prompt};
Chairman Pale Eagle...is innocent?${prompt};
What's the meaning of this!?${prompt};
Senator Karst, if you could be so kind?${prompt};
Listen to what I have to say, everyone!${prompt};
I myself was designated the next victim of the Tonberry assassin.${prompt};
I would have indeed shared the same fate as the late Senator Werner--Goddess rest his soul--had it not been for the heroic sacrifice of Chairman Pale Eagle. It is to him that I owe my life.${prompt};
What!?${prompt};
The chairman saved the senator's life...?${prompt};
The person who brought forth the allegations against the chairman was none other than myself.${prompt};
In spite of this, the chairman threw his life on the line to save me, the man who sought to have him removed from his post. Would the real mastermind behind the assassination plot place another's life before his own?${prompt};
For those of you who still doubt, a floorplan of the Senator of Defense's office was discovered on the body of the Tonberry assassin. The true culprit behind the assassination has been determined.${prompt};
So Chairman Pale Eagle was innocent all along!${prompt};
I am unreservedly convinced of the chairman's innocence. As President, I wish to offer an official apology, and will do my utmost to see him restored to the honored post he so rightly deserves.${prompt};
And I promise swift and firm retribution against the Beastman Confederate who have orchestrated this fiendish plot to destabilize our fair Republic.${prompt};
Stand by me now, for together we are strong!${prompt};
...But, Your Excellency, allowances cannot be made for charges of such grievous nature.${prompt};
Yes, of that I am aware...${prompt};
As a representative of the Security Office, I therefore duly request the handover of the suspect, Mythril Musketeer Five Moons.${prompt};
If you could spare just a few moments, I'd like to have a word with him.${prompt};
But of course, Mister President.${prompt};
Do you have anything to say for yourself?${prompt};
I see. So it is your intention to maintain silence to the end and make amends by paying with your life.${prompt};
Do you really think you can escape responsibility so easily?${prompt};
...!?${prompt};
You may think it honorable to die, but what of those who are left behind?${prompt};
What of the bereaved families of the many comrades who gladly gave their lives to your cause?${prompt};
And what of your fellow Mythril Musketeers who all this time have been scrambling tirelessly to clear your name? Are they to suffer not only the loss of valuable manpower, but also bear the burden of your tarnished legacy?${prompt};
Captain Klara.${prompt};
In this period of turmoil, is it not true that the absence of a single Mythril Musketeer could adversely affect the outcome of battle?${prompt};
Your words do us great honor, Mister President. Yes, our intelligence-gathering capability is highly regarded throughout the entire alliance.${prompt};
Mister President.;
I understand your intention, but if I may point out that--${prompt};
I knew I could count on your understanding, Dieter.${prompt};
S-sir!?${prompt};
Now, now, there's no need for overreaction. There is no reason whatsoever to believe the suspect will attempt a vanishing act.${prompt};
So I trust there will be no objections if I were to ask you to leave him in my care until the commencement of court-martial?${prompt};
...${prompt};
As you wish, Mister President.;
If Your Excellency will act as guarantor and provide the pertinent documentation, I will agree to this proposal.${prompt};
But if I may be so bold, the Senate may not be so lenient regarding this unorthodox solution.${prompt};
Your concern is appreciated, Dieter, but quite unnecessary.${prompt};
Now, Five Moons...or should I say, Galagg. You are to resume Mythril Musketeer duty as before. Understood?${prompt};
If the captain will still have me....${prompt};
The answer to that question is obvious, soldier.${prompt};
Hahaha... Then it's settled.${prompt};
Our nation must never again be divided.${prompt};
Galagg. Your role in ensuring a unified Bastok will be instrumental--of this I am certain. Much rests upon your able shoulders.${prompt};
Yes, Your Excellency.${prompt};
And ${name-player}.${prompt};
Captain Klara has told me of your part in destroying the enemy warmachines in the Ruhotz Silvermines. You have done our nation a great service.${prompt};
I thank you on behalf of all the citizens of Bastok.${prompt};
Please accept this as a symbol of my heartfelt gratitude.${prompt};
We look forward to your continued support in the future endeavors of our nation.${prompt};
<Sigh> All's well that ends well!${prompt};
Five Moons, don't you even dare think about putting us through such a mess again!${prompt};
C-Captain, I...${prompt};
You needn't say anything.;
Welcome back, Five Moons.${prompt};
Hey, Zeid. Isn't there anything you want to say to Five Moons?${prompt};
Hmph...${prompt};
The same old indefatigable Zeid, it seems.${prompt};
Leave him be. As a Galka, Zeid, too, would have much to think about on the recent happenings.${prompt};
Now, ${name-player}. As was mentioned by the president, we would like your continued assistance. Can we count on your help in the upcoming operation?${prompt};
Good. I knew we could depend on you. Now, with regards to the next--${prompt};
Ugh...!;
Captain? Are you feeling unwell?${prompt};
It...it's nothing. Just a bout of dizziness, nothing more...${prompt};
You've been overexerting yourself recently, Captain. Why, I honestly don't recall the last time you were off duty. A good rest is definitely in order.${prompt};
You may have the right of it...;
Volker, see to the issues as listed on the agenda in my stead. I will not be absent long...${prompt};
Understood, Captain.${prompt};
${name-player}, let's postpone the briefing for now and resume after the captain has sufficiently recovered.${prompt};
I've never seen Captain Klara in such a run-down state before. I hope it's nothing serious...${prompt};
Oh, and I heard the good news from Chief Sturm. Congratulations on being appointed the sixth member of the Mythril Musketeers!${prompt};
You've made it big, but don't forget about the little guys. It may have been gross negligence, but it was I who let you through here in the first place! Come back here to show your appreciation to yours truly from time to time, eh?${prompt};
Aaaaaah!!!${prompt};
Wh-what was that!?${prompt};
It came from over there!${prompt};
What is it!? What's happened!?${prompt};
Th-there...${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
Is he...d-dead?${prompt};
The cuts on his forehead almost look like a pattern...but where do I know it from?${prompt};
Ah! I think I remember now.;
Darksteel Hurricane... H-he's back!${prompt};
A-are you serious!?;
We have to inform the military police right away!${prompt};
R-right! Come on, let's go!${prompt};
There's still a hint of warmth to the body.;
This man was slain not more than two, perhaps three, hours ago.${prompt};
One clean slash severing the spinal cord was all it took.;
This is no ordinary killer we're dealing with.${prompt};
And the pattern gruesomely carved into the victim's forehead...${prompt};
This is all the evidence we need.;
The murderer's identity is beyond doubt.${prompt};
Blast it! Not a moment after we announce heightened security, and this happens right under our noses!;
The reputation of the military police will be in shambles!${prompt};
We've had enough negative publicity for one day.;
Send those sightseers on their way, and clean up the mess!${prompt};
Yes, sir! Right away, sir!${prompt};
What? You're on the trail of Darksteel Hurricane!?;
Well, you don't seem to be crazy, so I gather you're either a musketeer or part of that surly military police outfit.${prompt};
Not that that has any bearing on a law-abiding citizen like me, of course.;
But getting back on subject, I take it you already know that he wears a menacing scar on his forehead.${prompt};
Those who've met a brutal end by his cruel hand have all turned up with an identical wound carved into their foreheads.${prompt};
Speculation abounds on his motives, but if you ask me, only vengeance can so fuel a man's desire for blood.${prompt};
Just thinking about it makes my skin crawl.;
You certainly won't catch me going on late-night strolls any more. Nor do I intend to linger in the presence of a Galka whose forehead I cannot see.;
I advise you to do the same!${prompt};
D-did I hear you right!?;
You're asking me what I know about Darksteel Hurricane!?${prompt};
Wh-what's the big idea, inviting death to my door with a conversation topic like that!?;
“Sorry” won't cut it if I end up being the next to lie in a pool of my own blood!${prompt};
What? You promise to catch him before he can lay a finger on me, you say?;
A-alright then... But you didn't hear this from me, are we clear?${prompt};
He is said to wield a great sword with fearsome proficiency.${prompt};
I dare not imagine how much blood has been spilt in order to quench his blade's insatiable thirst...${prompt};
Hm? You're on the hunt for Darksteel Hurricane?;
So, the recent murders occurring within the Republic's walls have been traced back to him...${prompt};
First, a question from me.;
Do you know how the man came to be feared by the name Darksteel Hurricane?${prompt};
It's inspired by none other than the suit of darksteel armor he dons.;
With it, he can materialize unnoticed and melt back into the shadows at will...or so the rumors claim.${prompt};
Such is the speed at which he dispatches his victims, their lives are said to leave them long before the empty vessel of their bodies can crumple to the ground in a crimson mess.${prompt};
He is no creature of this world. Of this, I am certain.${prompt};
So, Darksteel Hurricane is responsible for the serial killings...${prompt};
${name-player}, it's fallen to you and the Mythril Musketeers once again to bring him to justice before any more lives are lost!${prompt};
You've already been briefed by Nicolaus, correct?;
Talk to the Goblin, Blatherix, and see if you can glean anything on the whereabouts of our suspect.${prompt};
Get it? Got it? Good!${prompt};
Headin' to the Mythril Musketeers' headquarters soon?;
Driftlix, or Limpears, as he's known in our circle, is ready when you are.${prompt};
I hear you're taking part in the large-scale manhunt for Darksteel Hurricane out at the Vunkerl Inlet.;
You'd better keep your eyes peeled and your ears open if want to come back with your limbs intact--errr...I mean, you be careful out there, ${name-player}!${prompt};
So the intelligence provided by that Goblin--Limpears, was it?--proved to be the real deal.;
If you run into the little fella again, tell him I apologize for my churlishness the other day.${prompt};
Oh, it's you.;
What's that? You wanna thank Limpears?${prompt};
Sorry, but you just missed him. He left here just a minute ago, skippin' along and whistlin' an old Gobbie tune.;
I haven't seen him so cheerful since his boss died and the business went under.${prompt};
It's all thanks to the stable flow of work he's found with the Mythril Musketeers.;
Now that his future's secured, he can focus on the more important stuff in life, like family.${prompt};
Seein' him happy puts a smile on my face. I know you can't see it, but I guarantee it's there.;
Anyway, here's a little somethin' for you, so you can share in on our delight.${prompt};
What's that you're sayin'?;
You wanna relive the Goblin experience?${prompt};
Heheheh, I can't say I'm surprised. Those who've had a taste of what it's like to be a Gobbie can never go back!;
Here, take this and run along now. It's on the house!${prompt};
Looks like we're good to go. Pay close attention now, 'cause I'm only gonna do this once.${prompt};
Step one: combine the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
It's all in the wrist, see.${prompt};
Step three: incant the magic words. Ahem!;
“Ooh Gobbie I love your way, every day～♪;
I wanna be like you night and day～♪”${prompt};
Oops, I almost went and forgot to add the active ingredient.${prompt};
${color-alt: 15}Blatherix plucks out a single strand of hair from inside his ear!;
And voila! Home-style Goblin Dust, just like Mama used to make!${prompt};
The meeting's about to start, so hurry up and scoff it down. No time for water!${prompt};
Ah, it's high time you came to. They do say first-timers are hit the hardest.;
But there's no time for rest. We don't want to keep the others waitin'. We Gobbies are nothin' if not punctual, y'know?${prompt};
Welcome, one and all, to the picturesque, war-ravaged Republic of Bastok.;
The 999th Meeting of Goblin Information Tycoons (GIT) is now in session.${prompt};
First on the agenda, the latest from each region.;
“Muckpads,” take it away.${prompt};
The San d'Orians have been pullin' their hair out by the handful, wonderin' why they can't gain no ground on the Orcs. They suspect an infiltrator in their ranks, but they ain't gettin' no closer to the truth. They're growin' desperate, fellas, real desperate. Meanin' they'd be willin' to pay a premium for any tidbits of intel that might help turn the tide of war.;
Any of youse got somethin' on this, share it with yours truly and I'll make sure it's worth your while. Heh heh heh...${prompt};
Understood.;
Next, “Muzzlespout.”${prompt};
We gots usselves a potential customer in da Yagudo. Dey wants da skinny on da Windurst crew, 'specially any dirts on da bandaged bigwig.;
I smells good beastcoin here, fellas--mountains o' it--and would 'preciate any extra pairs o' hands t' help wit da diggin'.${prompt};
Hm, that sounds mighty promisin'. I'll assign “Fuzzylens” to assist you.;
Moving on, “Limpears.”${prompt};
I uh...picked me up some discount Gigas gossip from Leadav--um, I mean “Sandtongue,” when I like, went walkabout to the Vunkerl Inlet. Any takerurers? It's priced to move.${prompt};
...${wait-36: 1};
Limpears, that information isn't worth its weight in chocobo bedding.;
Don't you have anythin' worth sharin'?${prompt};
G-gimme a sec... I'm sure I got somethin'...${prompt};
Y-yeah, that's it! I was like, frolickin'--um, prospectin' out in West Sarutabaruraruta just the other day, when a whole bunch of lycopodium saplings sprout right b'fore my very eyes!;
I was totally like, “Whoaaa!” Howsabout that for a scoop, eh? Eh?${prompt};
Scoop? You've gotta be kiddin' me...${prompt};
You call yourself a GIT? Hang your head in shame!${prompt};
S-sorry...${prompt};
Now, now, fellas, we're all playin' on the same team here.${prompt};
Fresh, marketable information ain't always easy to come by.;
I've got nothin' new to share this time, myself.${prompt};
But! I did bring an enthusiastic buyer with deep pockets near to burstin' with gil.;
Hear ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] out, will ya?${prompt};
Sorry, but I haven't seen the fella you're lookin' for.;
There ain't many Galka in San d'Oria, so I'd remember if I saw one like you described.${prompt};
And unless he's gots hisself a real scorcher o' a ship, we won't be seein' him nowhere near Windurst in a hurry.;
Your guy could be in lots o' places, but definitely not da Federation.${prompt};
I've like, totally seen him.${prompt};
A-are you sure, Limpears!?;
We're talkin' about a Galka here, not a goobbue.${prompt};
Hey, I'm lazy, not blind!;
I know what I saw. The Galka...he was like--${prompt};
What? You waitin' for a drum roll or somethin'? Go on, spit it out!${prompt};
<Sniff, sniff>...;
Somethin' stinks...like people.${prompt};
...!${prompt};
Well, we are in town, ya know.;
A bit of man-reek's nothin' out of the ordinary.${prompt};
<Sniff, sniff>...;
No. He's right. Da stink's close. Too close for comfort.${prompt};
You! You're no Goblin!;
You might like, be able to pull the wool over my eyes and stuff, but not my nose!${prompt};
“Badgermaw”! Whaddaya tryin' to pull here!?${prompt};
You used Goblin Dust, didn't ya? Knowin' full well it's forbidden!;
We oughts to turn ya into chocobo fodder!${prompt};
I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean any harm!${prompt};
L-let me explain. This here's no ordinary guest.;
${choice-player-gender}[He/She]'s the sixth member of the Mythril Musketeers!${prompt};
Hah! And I'm the Shadow Lord!${prompt};
A Mythril Musketeer...${prompt};
Hold it!${prompt};
I got a proposition for you. Take me to your headquarterurers, and I'll like, totally tell your captain everything I know about this so-called “Darkspiel Furrymane.”${prompt};
L-Limpears! You'd forsake the time-honored rules of our grandgobbies for a few extra beastcoins janglin' in your gobbiebag?${prompt};
Rules-shmules! Imagine the possibilities of bein' in the Mythril Musketeers' payroll.;
Is stickin' to a couple of moldy old traditions like, worth passin' up on such a delicious opportunity? Look me dead in the eye and tell me this isn't totally a win-win situation!${prompt};
Hrm... Hrmmm...${prompt};
Dang it, Limpears, you really can be persuasive sometimes, ya know that?;
Alright, then. I'm with ya on this one.${prompt};
And I'm wit ya, too!;
You go and gets dem musketeers so hooked on our intel, dey won't knows what t' do witout us no more!${prompt};
Heh, looks like the situation worked itself out...${prompt};
H-hey, ${name-player}. Is that a Goblin standing there beside you or are these back-to-back sentry shifts taking their toll on me?${prompt};
Oh, okay. Good to hear that I'm not hallucinating...yet.;
What? You're saying that the little fella can tell us where Darksteel Hurricane's hiding out?${prompt};
Hmmm... ${name-player} seems to trust you, so I'll let you through.;
But try anything funny, and you'll wonder why I have “gentle” in my name. You got that?${prompt};
Ah, we've been waiting for you.${prompt};
Hey, this is a pretty spiffy place you got here! I like your taste in interior design!;
So anyway, which one's the captain? Mister beardo, or the sweet-lookin' redhead?${prompt};
Mythril Musketeers Captain, Klara Bester, at your service. And what may we call you?${prompt};
The name's Drift--um, I mean, Limpears.;
I hear you're intererurested in like, catchin' a certain Galka I happen to have caught sight of recently.;
So...what's this morsel of information worth to ya?${prompt};
Shall we say...ten gold beastcoins?${prompt};
<Splutter> A-ahem! I don't usually like, deal in spare change, but I'll let you off for a special price just this once. Seein' how, y'know, it's totally your first time and all.${prompt};
Listen up, then.;
The Vunkerl Inlet--that's where I spotted your Galka.${prompt};
Oh? Is that all you have for us?;
Hmm, perhaps our beastcoins are better spent elsewhere...${prompt};
N-no, wait! There's more!;
I saw him near a...a waterfall. A place you people call, um, “Pipsqueak Falls”...or somethin' along those lines.${prompt};
All livin' things--whetherurer they're people or beasties--need like, water to survive, yeah? And your Galka's no exception.${prompt};
Pipereed Falls...;
That's in the vicinity of Berchlingen Bridge, where our forces recently clashed with the enemy.${prompt};
You have our gratitude.${prompt};
Should this information lead to the capture of Darksteel Hurricane, I'll see to it that you receive further recompense for your troubles.${prompt};
Whoaaa! You sure know how to scratch a guy the right way, lady! Pleasure doin' business with ya!${prompt};
The pleasure is all ours, Limpears.;
The Republic looks forward to your continued cooperation.${prompt};
Heehee! Wait till the otherurers hear about this!;
I'm totally goin' down in history as the greatest GIT ever to have lived!${prompt};
Captain Klara. I'm not sure I agree with your stance on allowing beastmen to run amok in the Metalworks, within earshot of the President's Office.${prompt};
Captain Bartholomaus, what a pleasant surprise.;
I was just about to have word sent to you.${prompt};
The Goblin whom you saw leave just now furnished us with intelligence on the probable location of Darksteel Hurricane.${prompt};
That Goblin? Truly?;
I find that rather hard to believe...${prompt};
We have no reason to doubt his reliability as an informant.;
My unit will hasten to the Vunkerl Inlet at the earliest opportunity.${prompt};
Needless to say, we intend to apprehend the target upon discovery.;
Can we still count on the full cooperation of your First Brigade in this matter?${prompt};
C-Captain!${prompt};
B-but of course! The First Brigade wishes nothing more than the expeditious capture of Darksteel Hurricane.;
What is the strategy to be employed in this manhunt?${prompt};
The target's current base of operation is believed to be within close proximity to Pipereed Falls in the Vunkerl Inlet.;
Search participants will form an ever-tightening grid of encirclement within a set radius of the location--${prompt};
...With the goal of flushing Darksteel Hurricane out onto Berchlingen Bridge, where he'll have no place to run or hide.${prompt};
You read my mind, Captain.${prompt};
Very well. I will have both Musketeers and Junior Musketeers alike prepare for immediate departure.${prompt};
You have our gratitude.${prompt};
Captain... Capturing Darksteel Hurricane is the Mythril Musketeers' best shot at restoring its reputation.;
While I'm not oblivious to the assurance that greater numbers offer, our target is but one man--${prompt};
いえ、万全を期すためには;
人員は多い方が良いのは分かるのですが……${prompt};
Volker. More innocent lives may be lost while we clamber about trying to regain the public's trust.;
What is the reputation of the Mythril Musketeers when compared to the safety of the citizens?${prompt};
Y-you're right, ma'am. Please forgive my naiveté.${prompt};
I'm glad you understand.;
Now then. ${name-player} and Volker, you two are to accompany me to the Vunkerl Inlet. Make ready to leave at once.${prompt};
Zeid and the others are to remain and see to security within the capital, should our prey decide to make another appearance.${prompt};
Yes, ma'am!${prompt};
${name-player}! I've heard all about the great news: Darksteel Hurricane is no more!${prompt};
Now all citizens of Bastok--excluding myself, of course, because I was never intimidated--won't have to live in fear anymore! Hurrah!${prompt};
I see... So that was how the legend of Darksteel Hurricane came to an end...${prompt};
Unfortunately, the man's motives for choosing this particular juncture to resume his bloody reign went with him to the grave.;
For me, at least, this spells several sleepless nights to come.${prompt};
Be that as it may, we have to content ourselves with the knowledge that no more innocent blood will be shed.;
Besides, with the new responsibilities that have been entrusted to our unit, you won't have the luxury of time to dwell on such matters.${prompt};
...?${prompt};
I received a message from Chairman Pale Eagle just moments ago.${prompt};
The Senate has passed a motion to reappoint the Mythril Musketeers to its customary post by the president's side.${prompt};
Truly, Captain!?${prompt};
I am pleased to say so. It would appear the powers that be recognized our contribution towards solving these latest incidents.${prompt};
A ceremony will take place in the President's Office shortly.;
Zeid and I have been invited to attend as representatives of our unit.${prompt};
Nicolaus, prepare the report to be filed to the Security Office.;
I will be making my rounds to the Department of Industry in the meantime.${prompt};
Phew. Looks like we managed to come out on top in this little in-house tussle with the First Brigade.${prompt};
Yeah...${prompt};
Is something troubling you, Five Moons?${prompt};
Don't misunderstand me--I'm as relieved as any of us here that the citizens can live in peace once more.${prompt};
Yet, a part of me struggles to come to terms with Darksteel Hurricane's death.${prompt};
...${prompt};
It's silly, I know.${prompt};
I will go to the Vunkerl Inlet.${prompt};
As both Galka and Mythril Musketeer, I must confirm with my own eyes the death of a man who had once ruled my existence.;
Or else I fear there will be no closure for me in this lifetime.${prompt};
F-Five Moons, wait--${prompt};
Let us accompany him, ${name-player}.;
It's the least we can do for a comrade in this period of internal turmoil.${prompt};
Captain.${prompt};
What is it?${prompt};
The encounter at the Vunkerl Inlet...${prompt};
……「黒鉄の旋風」のことか？${prompt};
...${prompt};
What of it? Darksteel Hurricane lies dead and all blemishes have been cleansed from the Mythril Musketeers' name.;
We could not have hoped for a more ideal ending to a messy affair. Do you not agree?${prompt};
Spare me the deception, Captain!${prompt};
Who was it that you crossed swords with on the bridge?${prompt};
...${prompt};
That Galka was not Darksteel Hurricane!;
You know this to be true above any other!${prompt};
Hah... For a fleeting moment, I thought the old you had returned, Zeid.${prompt};
Simmer down, soldier.${prompt};
Mind that you acquit yourself well while we're in the President's Office.${prompt};
You're looking for Five Moons and Nicolaus?;
The two of them departed for the Vunkerl Inlet a short while ago in utter silence. I wonder why they'd want to go back there...${prompt};
Oh, hello there, ${name-player}. Is there something I can help you with?${prompt};
Nicolaus has asked you to fetch ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, you say?${prompt};
Well, you're in luck, because I was issued one of these babies just yesterday for use in riot control. You can have it, as long as you promise to think of your friend Gentle Tiger when tossing it into an unsuspecting swarm of hostiles.${prompt};
Don't keep Nicolaus waiting for the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, now. Off you go.${prompt};
What? You want another ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}? I suppose I could give you my spare, but then, how am I supposed to keep myself entertained during those long, tedious night shifts?;
<Sigh>... Alright, alright! I'll let you have it! Just stop staring at me like that!${prompt};
Hm? What's the matter, ${name-player}? You look like you've seen a Tonberry.;
Uh...not that I'm afraid of those cute little critters, of course...${prompt};
Oh, Captain Klara and Zeid?;
The two of them should be on their way to the President's Office as we speak.${prompt};
Zeid. Do you recall my words to you the day you joined the Mythril Musketeers?${prompt};
As clear as if it were yesterday, Captain.;
You said to me that to forward the peace and prosperity of the Republic, one must be prepared to overcome unimaginable hardships.${prompt};
どのような辛酸を嘗め、;
苦境に立たされようとも、;
正義のために戦い続けると……${prompt};
And for the sake of this cause, one must not scruple to employ whatever means necessary, be they fair or foul.${prompt};
These words stand resolute to this day.${prompt};
Do you still share this belief with me, Zeid?${prompt};
I have never believed otherwise, Captain. Were it not for you, I would have been condemned to live out the rest of my wretched life as a creature lesser than a beast.${prompt};
Come what may, I will follow you to the end.${prompt};
Then swear me this, Zeid.${prompt};
That whatever you may witness from this point onwards, you will never cease to believe in me.${prompt};
I swear, Captain.${prompt};
Mythril Musketeers Captain Klara Bester and Mythril Musketeer Zeid reporting.${prompt};
Ah, Klara, Zeid. It has simply been too long. I thank you for coming.${prompt};
It is we who are deeply honored by your invitation, Your Excellency.${prompt};
Hahaha, let's do away with the pomp and ceremony, shall we? On your feet, the both of you.${prompt};
Truth be told, none was more troubled than I over the Mythril Musketeers' dismissal from its post.${prompt};
But loath as I was to be bereft of your unit's reassuring presence, regrettably, there were those of influence who weren't so favorably inclined following that incident.;
I fear I had little choice but to appease their demands.${prompt};
I fervently apologize for the distress my unit has caused.${prompt};
No matter. It's all in the past now.;
Besides, true to your reputation, you have found a way back to my side again, and not a moment too soon.${prompt};
You are too kind, Your Excellency.;
I, too, have waited long for this moment.${prompt};
For today...;
Is the day I bathe my blade in your blood!${prompt};
...!?${prompt};
K-Klara? I am not seeing the humor in this...${prompt};
Zeid.;
Don't forget the oath you swore.${prompt};
C-Captain! What are you doing!?${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
I had expected better of you, Volker.;
I will not tolerate insubordination in any shape or form.${prompt};
...${prompt};
Taking a blade to one of your own...${prompt};
What madness has taken you, Klara!?;
Ugh!;
He who would call himself the leader of a nation must learn to be gracious in defeat.${prompt};
The time of parting is come.;
Farewell, President Prien of the Republic of Bastok!${prompt};
Zeid! Have you so quickly forgotten your oath? Stand down!${prompt};
Captain! Please cease this madness!${prompt};
Hm!? That was the sound of swords clashing!;
Volker!${prompt};
Captain... So the situation is as we feared...;
I'm coming to your aid, Zeid!;
...!;
Zeid? Why do you interfere!?${prompt};
Listen well, Zeid. The next time we meet...${prompt};
Captain?${prompt};
It will not be me who stands before you!${prompt};
Why, Captain Klara.;
I heard noises and so rushed here--${prompt};
!?${prompt};
Th-that unsheathed blade...${prompt};
Captain Klara!?${prompt};
Something is amiss! With me, men!${prompt};
M-Mister President! Are you unharmed!?${prompt};
Great Kaiser's ghost!${prompt};
Stay right where you are, all of you!${prompt};
That Captain Klara would attempt to take the life of the president and even strike down Volker with murderous intent...;
None of this makes any sense!${prompt};
Every single member of the Mythril Musketeers has been detained for questioning.;
Looks like you being overlooked in all this is the only silver lining we'll be seeing in this darkest of clouds...${prompt};
With the intensity of the war against the beastmen near to boiling, this internal discord couldn't have come at a worse time.;
I'm afraid to imagine what will become of the nation...${prompt};
${name-player}! You're the Republic's only hope!;
Please don't abandon us in this hour of need!${prompt};
(Mmm, Galkan sausages...pumpkin pie...om nom nom nom...);
...Hm?${prompt};
Oh, it's you, ${name-player}. Forgive me.;
Ever since the attempt on the president's life, I haven't been sleeping so well at night.${prompt};
A guardsman like me's got plenty of time to ponder.;
No matter how much I rack my brains, though, I can't believe that Captain Klara was behind the heinous deed.${prompt};
Ah, were it only so!${prompt};
You can say that again, friend.${prompt};
Why, if it isn't Nicolaus and Five Moons!;
How fare the Mythril Musketeers?${prompt};
They fare not at all, I'm afraid.;
Thanks to our erstwhile captain's foray into the field of presidential assassination, our glorious unit has been disbanded, and its members relegated to penal duty.${prompt};
We proudly stand before you as Nicolaus and Five Moons of Disciplinary Company Skink.;
Zeid was sent to the field with Company Jackal, no doubt to perform some suitably arduous and trivial task.${prompt};
Consider yourself lucky you were only an honorary member of our squad, ${name-player}.;
Were you a full-fledged Musketeer, you'd surely have suffered the same fate.${prompt};
I just can't make sense of it, Nicolaus.;
What unholy madness could have driven an honorable soldier to such treachery?${prompt};
I wish I had answers, Five Moons, but my deductive powers fail me this time.;
There's simply no logical motive that could account for the captain of the Mythril Musketeers drawing steel against the very man she was sworn to protect.${prompt};
...And yet that's exactly what she did.;
Even Volker was made to feel the wrath of her treasonous blade.${prompt};
Thankfully, he suffered only graze wounds.;
Still, one thing remains clear. Captain Klara must be tracked down and made to answer for her crimes.${prompt};
So this is where you slithery Skinks scurried off to!;
We've got a situation on our hands!${prompt};
Disciplinary Captain Herbert! Whatever is the matter?${prompt};
Ahem. Whatever is the matter, “sir.”;
I'm your superior now, and you'd best not be forgetting!;
It's that masked meddler Zeid...he's deserted his unit!${prompt};
What!?${prompt};
You heard me, I said he deserted!;
An emergency dispatch just came in from the Jackal sergeant in Beadeaux.;
He says your surly comrade went off on a survey of Quadav territory, and failed to return with his squad.${prompt};
I've ordered a handful of men to join the search effort, and it's time you got off your pampered posteriors and joined them.;
You hear me, Skinks? That's an order!${prompt};
Y-yes sir!;
Incidentally, would you happen to have any insight into his destination?;
Any potential leads at all would be most--${prompt};
What do I look like, a Goblin tipster? I haven't the time or interest to keep up with every half-baked rumor brought to me!;
Besides, I've business in Eldieme. If you're going to bother someone, make it Sergeant Rainer of the Jackals.;
Now get lost! And next time I see you scrubs, that overgrown loafer had better be with you!${prompt};
Desertion? That doesn't sound at all like the Zeid I know...${prompt};
As if we hadn't suffered enough indignity, now he flouts our superiors further? What could the man possibly be thinking?;
But I'm afraid we haven't the luxury to ponder his motives. If we don't find him, and soon, we can prepare for the worst...${prompt};
The worst, you say?${prompt};
The maximum penalty for desertion during wartime is death, after all...and there are plenty of loose cannons in the disciplinary regiments looking to impress their superiors.;
If one of them were to find him, why, his sentence just might be carried out on the spot...${prompt};
Then we must find him before the others do!${prompt};
Yes. If we can convince him to return of his own accord, there's still hope.;
But it'll be no small task to track him down without knowing his true intentions...${prompt};
In any event, there's nothing to be gained standing around here.;
Let's make for Beadeaux and see what clues this Sergeant Rainer may have for us.${prompt};
I trust you're up to the task as well, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Excellent! With our three heads together, we're bound to come up with something.;
Very well then, let's be off!${prompt};
Captain Bartholomaus, you say?;
Why, he was in the briefing room, last I saw.${prompt};
I'll warn you, though--he seemed to be in an especially prickly mood.;
It would seem the investigation has taken a toll on us all...${prompt};
The enrollment records? And what business would you have with those, hmm?${prompt};
For all I know, you could be scheming with those treasonous friends of yours.${prompt};
And what if ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] were, Bartholomaus?${prompt};
Well, well...if it isn't the Mythril Skinks.;
To what do I owe the honor?${prompt};
I was simply offering your colleague a piece of honest advice: if ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] wishes to stay on the right side of the law, it'd behoove ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to stay away from the likes of you.${prompt};
Anyhow, your request is as futile as it is foolish.;
All records pertaining to your ignoble unit have been seized and locked away until the investigation is over.${prompt};
Not even my own loyal men are allowed access, let alone a couple of misfits deemed unfit for duty by virtue of their connection to the very incident they now poke their meddling noses into.${prompt};
Why, nothing short of authorization from Disciplinary Captain Herbert could convince me otherwise.;
But don't despair. I'm sure he'd be simply thrilled to make such a request on behalf of a pair of Skinks as...distinguished...as you two.;
Ha ha ha!${prompt};
There's one man who hasn't lost his knack for adding insult to injury.${prompt};
Still, we mustn't give in! Captain Herbert said he had business at the Eldieme Necropolis.;
We can only hope that he takes pity on our plight.${prompt};
Oh, ${name-player}.;
Nicolaus just came rushing through here like a rabid fledermaus.${prompt};
Whatever do you suppose has gotten into him?;
At any rate, go on in. He should be right inside.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}, Five Moons!;
Took the scenic route, did you?${prompt};
Forgive me. I simply couldn't bear the wait, so I took it upon myself to peruse the records on my own.${prompt};
Little to my surprise, it didn't take long to come across a most...intriguing...passage.${prompt};
You've found a clue!?${prompt};
The entry in question is dated C.E. 858, or roughly six years ago.;
It reads...${prompt};
<Ahem>;
“...In the vicinity of Hoarfang Keep in Beaucedine, Captain Klara Bester of the Mythril Musketeers captured and took into custody the Galka War Cloud...”${prompt};
“Captured”...!?;
What could this mean? What could Zeid possibly have done that would call for his “capture!?”;
Who...was he?${prompt};
I'm afraid the report goes into no further detail.;
Still, to be chased out to the far reaches of such savage territory, it's clear enough he was up to no good.${prompt};
Wait...Hoarfang?;
Why does that name ring so familiar to me...?${prompt};
...Yes!;
Yes, of course!;
That was the site of the Galkan massacre!${prompt};
The Galkan...massacre?;
Ah, you speak of the Thirteenth!${prompt};
Have you heard the tale, ${name-player}?;
It was some seven years ago. The Thirteenth Regiment was dispatched to Beaucedine for a particularly perilous campaign against the beastmen.${prompt};
But the Thirteenth was no ordinary unit...it was comprised entirely of Galka, you see.;
Some even say it was for this reason that they were chosen for such a dangerous mission.;
It cannot be denied, given how deep prejudices ran in those days.${prompt};
Unfortunately, the tale comes to a tragic end.;
Reports from the front said that they fought dauntlessly against a foe who vastly outnumbered them.;
In the end, not a single brave soldier was to return.${prompt};
Nicolaus, could there be some connection between Zeid's disappearance and the fate of the Thirteenth?${prompt};
As it stands, it's the only lead we've got.;
Come, ${name-player}, Five Moons! Let us make for Beaucedine...for Hoarfang!${prompt};
I, too, feel we will find our answers there.;
But let us be cautious... The glacier is not a forgiving place.${prompt};
Say it isn't so, ${name-player}! Is it true that Zeid has been arrested and imprisoned!?;
Why, that man was like a brother to me! The most honorable soldier I've ever known!;
Ever since the day he saved me from the black blade of Bi'Gho Headtaker, I swore to myself that I'd follow him to the ends of the earth if he asked, I would, and question his honor not one minute, one second for as long as I lived!;
He was framed! Framed, I tell you! And I'll see to it that he suffers not a day longer in whatever dark, dank, musty gaol they've got him locked away in if I have to storm in there, bash some gaoler heads, and rip open the cold iron bars of his cell with my own bare hands!;
Do you hear me, Zeid!? Gentle Tiger will not rest until your honor is restored!!!${prompt};
Ah...! <Ahem>;
Forgive me, ${name-player}. My emotions got the better of me for a moment there.;
(I hope I wasn't overheard!)${prompt};
(Phew, that was a close one!;
But weren't you able to persuade the others to listen to reason?)${prompt};
(I don't know what happened out at the glacier, but surely Zeid deserves a chance to clear his name!;
Nicolaus and Five Moons are inside. You must talk to them and see what can be done.;
Our friend is counting on us, ${name-player}!)${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}.;
I trust your journey back from the glacier was uneventful?${prompt};
It would seem the rumors are true: Zeid has been locked away in a maximum-security cell of the Benedikt Watchtower.;
Captain Bartholomaus took great pleasure in informing me of this fact personally.;
There is no word yet as to what his punishment will be, but it'll not be light, I assure you.${prompt};
I've conveyed the news to Volker as well.;
The events at Beaucedine, Zeid and Klara's past, the true identity of Darksteel Hurricane...${prompt};
Let it suffice to say that he was in a state of disbelief.;
The two joined the Mythril Musketeers together, and he was closer to Zeid than any save the captain herself.;
And yet, he knew nothing of all this.${prompt};
I can still hardly believe it myself...${prompt};
No Galka who has ever felt the sting of prejudice could begrudge him the depths of bitterness and hate he must have borne for the Humes since that day. But to allow that to turn him to wanton, reckless murder...${prompt};
I fully intended to file an official report to the Security Office on Darksteel Hurricane's identity.${prompt};
...Volker would have none of that, however.;
He still believes in them, and insists that Captain Klara must have had due reason for taking Zeid under her wing.${prompt};
Truly, have his injuries gone to his head?;
It seems clear to me that any shred of honor once possessed by our one-time comrades is gone, and we deal now with little more than two common criminals.${prompt};
Still, I cannot simply disregard the words of my superior.;
We will refrain from notifying the authorities until we can ascertain their motives beyond a shadow of a doubt.;
Mum's the word on what you've seen, ${name-player}.${prompt};
...Anyhow, forgive me.;
I shouldn't burden you with my musings on matters beyond your control.${prompt};
Volker has near recovered from his wounds, and will soon be restored to active duty.;
Five Moons and I must return to Company Skink as well.${prompt};
Your assistance has been greatly appreciated, ${name-player}.;
Until we meet again.${prompt};
What's that you say?;
Nicolaus and Five Moons have returned to their unit!?${prompt};
Do they intend to leave Zeid to rot away in his cell?;
Will they sit idly by as he is sentenced to death!?${prompt};
He was their comrade! Are bonds of mythril so brittle as this?${prompt};
I worry for Zeid, ${name-player}.;
The look in your eyes tells me you feel the same.${prompt};
I know! Why don't you pay a visit to Benedikt Watchtower?;
Surely your company would raise his spirits, and there just might be a way to help restore his good name.${prompt};
Here, take this, and tell Zeid that it's from his loyal friends.;
That no matter how many turn against him, there are those of us who will always believe!${prompt};
What!?;
Zeid has escaped from the watchtower?${prompt};
(As much as I believe in his innocence, surely this isn't the way!;
Why, this will only compound his guilt!)${prompt};
There must be something we can do...${prompt};
Is something the matter, friend?${prompt};
Nicolaus! Five Moons!;
You must listen!${prompt};
I can hardly believe it, but...${prompt};
Wh-what!? Zeid has vanished again!?${prompt};
I worry for him, friends!;
Is there nothing to be done to save him from his fate?${prompt};
I'm afraid the time for that is long past.;
He had a choice, and has clearly chosen the traitor's path.${prompt};
Besides, Five Moons and I must soon make for Xarcabard.${prompt};
The Allied Forces are locked in a bitter and crucial struggle against the Beastman Confederate.;
With the ranks of our army thinned, the disciplinary regiments have been summoned to the front lines.${prompt};
We can ill afford to be distracted by those two any longer.;
Though it pains me as well, we must wash our hands of them once and for all.${prompt};
You can't mean this...!;
${name-player}! Surely you don't mean to abandon him too?${prompt};
If anyone can bring him back and make him see reason, it's you!;
Ah, if only we knew where the Captain has taken him...${prompt};
Xarcabard!?${prompt};
...!;
Why didn't you say so sooner, ${name-player}? Do you realize what this means!?;
None other than the president himself leads our army's advance in Xarcabard!${prompt};
No...!;
Nicolaus, does the captain mean to--?${prompt};
I'd stake my life on it!;
And if she finds him, I don't care how many guards he has in his retinue--it won't be enough.${prompt};
${name-player}. We haven't a moment to lose.${prompt};
You must go to Xarcabard and inform the field commanders of the danger.;
Then you must join up with the Republican Army, and do everything in your power to see that no harm befalls the president.${prompt};
We must travel with Company Skink, but will follow as soon as we are able.;
Can we count on you, ${name-player}?${prompt};
Excellent. We may have lost Zeid, but you're a staunch ally as ever.${prompt};
${lettercase: 1}${keyitem-article: 0[2]} is required for any soldier to be accepted into the president's retinue.${prompt};
I'll ask Disciplinary Captain Herbert to prepare one.;
With the information you've given us, I'm sure we can convince him of the urgency of our cause.${prompt};
Now Goddess speed you, ${name-player}!;
We shall meet again in Xarcabard!${prompt};
If it isn't ${name-player}, hero of the Republic!;
Why, the entire Metalworks is abuzz with talk of how you saved the president's life!${prompt};
How did we hear, you say?${prompt};
Why, a dispatch just came in from the front lines.;
The president leads the Republican Army on an advance deeper north into Xarcabard--we've got the beastmen on the run, ${name-player}!${prompt};
But is it true that Captain Klara made another attempt on his life? And what of Zeid!?${prompt};
I see...so the fiend that targets our president is not the true Captain Klara, but a demonic impostor?;
Now there's a tale to chill the blood!${prompt};
But with the Mythril Musketeers back on the job--and you at their side--the Republic couldn't be in better hands.;
We're counting on you, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Nicolaus and Five Moons have already left for Beadeaux.;
Weren't you going to join them?${prompt};
Your comrades just left for the Eldieme Necropolis.;
Said they had urgent business with Captain Herbert?${prompt};
Nicolaus said he and Five Moons were headed for Beaucedine!;
What errand calls them to such a dangerous place?${prompt};
What? You're going too!?;
Take care of yourself, ${name-player}. The monsters prowling that Goddess-forsaken glacier are something fierce!${prompt};
How can you just stroll around here while Zeid rots away in Benedikt Watchtower?;
Have a heart, ${name-player}!${prompt};
The President--no, the whole Republic--is counting on you, ${name-player}.;
You must make for Xarcabard!${prompt};
What!? You've lost your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?;
I'd expected better of you, ${name-player}!${prompt};
If it were me, sure, I'm dropping and fumbling things all the time--why do you think I'm still a doorman after all these years?--but you...;
Anyway, here's a spare copy for you. Try to hold on to this one!${prompt};
We may have driven the beastmen back, but their advance will not be stayed so easily.;
Stay wary, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Oh, there you are, ${name-player}!;
Volker's been looking all over for you.${prompt};
Says he's got an urgent matter 'bout Captain Klara to discuss.;
I'm not privy to the details, but you'd best head inside straight away.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}, you've come.;
Excellent.${prompt};
I owe you a debt of gratitude for your service the other day.;
Thanks in no small part to your efforts, our forces have gained the upper hand in Xarcabard.${prompt};
As for the Mythril Musketeers, we'll be taking advantage of this situation to redouble our efforts in pursuit of Captain Klara.;
Nicolaus, if you would.${prompt};
Ahem, yes.;
First, let us review what we've gleaned so far.${prompt};
It is clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that our erstwhile leader--or whatever is posing as her--is in league with the Confederate in some capacity.${prompt};
Therefore, it stands to reason that she has ensconced herself deep in the stronghold of our foe.;
Yes...in Castle Zvahl.${prompt};
The Allied Forces will be mounting a siege effort on the castle, and we'll be moving out to join them.;
This should afford us the perfect opportunity to track down the Captain.${prompt};
Allow me to be blunt, ${name-player}.;
Our mission will take us to the very heart of enemy territory--right under the Shadow Lord's twisted nose.${prompt};
There is no guarantee that we will escape with our lives.;
And yet, we would have no other fight at our side. Will you stand with us?${prompt};
Will you stand with us?;
${selection-lines};
Until the end.;
I am sorry...${prompt};
The fate of the Republic is at stake, ${name-player}.;
I beg you to reconsider.${prompt};
Thank you, ${name-player}.;
Ever the stalwart ally, you are.${prompt};
If we are settled, then let us be off.;
Action, not talk, will win the day.${prompt};
${name-player}. A moment, if you would.${prompt};
I will speak frankly with you: my conscience does not sit well about being forced to work together with Zeid.;
The man we once called comrade has been revealed to be naught more than a cold-blooded murderer.${prompt};
Were it not a direct order from the President, I would have excused myself from this mission.;
Mark my words--as soon as we are finished, I will not so much as look that man in the eye again for as long as I live.${prompt};
<Sigh>... Nicolaus...${prompt};
In any event, standing around here chatting will get us no closer to any answers.;
We must make for Castle Zvahl.${prompt};
See to your preparations and join us as soon as you are ready.;
I need not remind you that time is of the essence.${prompt};
The truth will not elude our grasp this time.${prompt};
You're still here, ${name-player}?;
Zeid and the others have already left for Castle Zvahl.${prompt};
If only I could join you! Why, I'd have that Shadow Lord crying for mercy before he could so much as raise that twisted, towering blade of his...sharp enough to, uh...cleave a full-grown Galka c-clean in...;
Er, ah...on second thought, never mind that. Safe travels!${prompt};
Well! If it isn't ${name-player} making ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] triumphant return!${prompt};
I've already heard how you managed to save Captain Klara from the foul clutches of darkness.;
Spectacularly done, ${name-player}!${prompt};
Zeid and the others? Why, they're with the President--as you should be!;
He's returned from the field especially for this occasion!${prompt};
My friends. I am pleased to see your safe return.${prompt};
Never would I have suspected that Captain Klara was possessed by one of those foul creatures...${prompt};
And yet, reflecting back on the past months, it explains much.${prompt};
In my ignorance, I thought it merely the travails of war that weighed on her mind.;
To think that she was waging an even fiercer battle all this time. A battle for her very soul...${prompt};
The knowledge that she may lose herself completely, that at any moment she might turn her blade against her beloved comrades...;
It must have been harrowing, indeed.${prompt};
This I know: Klara is fortunate indeed to have friends such as you.;
Were it not for your efforts, there is little doubt we would have lost her long ago.${prompt};
On behalf of the entire republic, you have my gratitude.${prompt};
And yet, our battle is far from over.${prompt};
The latest report has just come in from the front lines.;
Thanks to the efforts of the Allied infiltration unit, we've finally secured a direct line of attack against the enemy stronghold.${prompt};
The Allied Forces will move against Castle Zvahl with the full brunt of its strength.;
I will personally lead the Republican Army in support of this offensive.${prompt};
I would have you march with me.;
Under normal circumstances, you'd have earned yourselves a rest for your efforts, but I'm afraid that is a luxury we cannot afford.${prompt};
Mister President...does this mean--?${prompt};
By presidential decree, the Mythril Musketeers are hereby reinstated in full.${prompt};
Zeid. Until such time as Captain Klara is fit to return to duty, I would have you serve as acting captain in her stead.${prompt};
Clearly, the bonds you share are as strong--nay, stronger--than the metal from which you take your name.;
Let these bonds of friendship be your strength, and even the darkest shadow will prove no match for you.${prompt};
Yes, sir!${prompt};
And you, ${name-player}...${prompt};
You hail from a distant realm, this I know.;
Despite this, you have made one sacrifice after the next in our Republic's name.${prompt};
It would be no exaggeration to say that without your unflagging efforts, Bastok would not stand as strong as it does today.${prompt};
As a token of my gratitude, I give you this.${prompt};
Furthermore, from this day forward you shall be a full-fledged member of the Mythril Musketeers.;
The Republic would have your strength for as long as it stands.${prompt};
Three cheers for Mythril Musketeer ${name-player}!${prompt};
They tell me our guardsman Gentle Tiger has dubbed you the Sixth Musketeer.;
I will do him one better: I hereby bestow upon you the designation of Mythril Musketeer Zero.${prompt};
A wayfarer from far-off lands you are, and yet serve our nation as loyally as any true Bastoker ever has.;
Never lose sight of your origins, for it is your unique background that allows you to serve us as no other can.${prompt};
Once a Mythril Musketeer, forever a Mythril Musketeer.;
The Republic is stronger for your presence, ${name-player}. Promise us that it will always be so.${prompt};
Simply incredible... Why, the zero designation is an honor that's been granted to only the most illustrious musketeers in the history of our unit.${prompt};
I must confess to feeling a bit of jealousy, ${name-player}.;
But just you wait: I fully expect to distinguish myself in the none-too-distant future!${prompt};
${name-player}.;
It has been--and always will be--an honor to fight by your side.${prompt};
With the Mythril Musketeers back in action, the Republic truly has nothing to fear!${prompt};
I was holdin' out that my efforts might've warranted a decoration from the President as well. Hey, keepin' this door here safe from the beastman onslaught isn't easy, you know!;
Ah, well. There's always next time.${prompt};
You, there. Have you happened to come into possession of any sealed containers in your crossings with the beastmen?${prompt};
Some of our bravest soldiers have recently been bringing back a number of such containers following successful invasions of beastman strongholds. Our hope was that within they would contain some sensitive intel we could exploit.;
Only, upon returning, all those who came in contact with these containers began to die off inexplicably, one after the other.${prompt};
At present, the Allied Forces are treating these as cases of assassination by the Beastman Confederate elite.;
It would seem they are willing to go to any length to prevent the contents of these containers from being made known.${prompt};
Should you happen to get your hands on any such container, it is imperative that you bring it back here with all haste and turn it in to an agent.${prompt};
Just as we suspected. This contains a great deal of information that will prove vital to our cause.;
Hm, what's this? Not sure what to make of this... Doesn't seem to be terribly important.;
Here, why don't you hang onto it? See if you can't get some use out of it down the road.${prompt};
Just as we suspected. This contains a great deal of information that will prove vital to our cause.;
I'll keep it here under strict supervision while we investigate its contents. Job well done, soldier.${prompt};
The ${choice: 0}[Royal Army of San d'Oria/Republican Army of Bastok/Federal Forces of Windurst]'s ${choice: 1}[funds have increased/resources have increased/supplies have increased/reconnaissance has improved/skill has risen/production has risen/morale has risen/prosperity has risen]!${prompt};
My dear Count Borel, it is good to see you again!${prompt};
We had received word that you would be coming.${prompt};
Good to see you also, Radford. My apologies for the late notice.;
And pray excuse my brashness, but time is of the essence. How soon may we present ourselves to His Excellency?${prompt};
Word of your arrival has already reached the president's ears. This way, please.${prompt};
Welcome to our fair republic.${prompt};
It is my understanding that you bring a matter of grave importance to this discussion table. I hope you don't mind my legati taking part.${prompt};
No, not at all, Your Excellency. Now, if you'll allow me to explain the events which have led to this sudden visit...${prompt};
...Jeuno is to surrender?${prompt};
That the very architect of the alliance could have had such a drastic change of heart is inconceivable...${prompt};
On delivering the news to King Destin, Sir Nag'molada appended that the three nations, too, should make ready for unconditional surrender. Throwing down our swords, however, is the last thing on the mind of San d'Orians.${prompt};
As it is ours.${prompt};
A Jeunoan surrender would have a calamitous effect on the war, and must be avoided no matter the cost. To this end, San d'Oria will dispatch a contingent of knights to aid in the Duchy's defense. And now, the Kingdom humbly asks that our ally, Bastok, too, lends soldiers to this most worthy of causes.${prompt};
What say you all?${prompt};
As much as we'd like to rush to Jeuno's aid, to put it bluntly, we haven't the capacity to do so. We've incurred heavy losses over the course of this accursed war. Any further dints to our rank, and we'd have no choice but to consider conscripting civilians.${prompt};
I must concur. In our current state, sending away even a small contingent of soldiers would be tantamount to cutting off our own sword arms on the eve of battle.${prompt};
But, but...${prompt};
The Fourth Division, too, suffers from a severe shortage of hands. Countless Republican soldiers--good men and women--were felled at the Battle of Grauberg. Grave though the situation in Jeuno may be, I fear we have no soldiers to spare. However...${prompt};
It pains me to have to say this, Count Borel. But given the circumstances, Bastok cannot answer the call.${prompt};
We ask for your understanding. In better times, such a discussion would not even have been necessary.${prompt};
Fourth Division, Seventh Cohors Praefectus, Zazarg, reporting!${prompt};
Zazarg, what is the meaning of this intrusion?${prompt};
My apologies. As the head of the Fourth Division, it was I who called upon the praefectus.${prompt};
Yes, and my apologies for gatecrashing this little party, and eavesdropping and whatnot...${prompt};
But, enough beating around the bush.;
Ahem! Mister President, sir! Requesting permission to lead the Seventh Cohors in Jeuno's defense, sir!${prompt};
...${prompt};
You don't need to worry about manpower, if that's what's on your mind. As of late, my unit's received a generous injection of young blood raring to prove themselves on the battlefield.${prompt};
You're joking, surely? The Seventh Cohors are more akin to a basket of rotten eggs than a military unit. What can a bunch of untried social misfits hope to achieve?${prompt};
Gahahahaha!;
Legatus Berger, if you don't mind sparing a bit of your precious time, it'd be my pleasure to give you an inspection tour of the Seventh Cohors.${prompt};
See the lads and lasses with your own eyes, and even you will be compelled to retract your “rotten eggs” comment. And that comes with the Zazarg guarantee!${prompt};
It's quite the mystery, but all who join the Seventh Cohors--even the disagreeable types abandoned by society as lost causes--undergo a transformation and are reborn as disciplined soldiers.${prompt};
They sure are, with ${name-player} over there being one of my more notable achievements. Who'd believe that the fine soldier standing before you now used to be a foul-mouthed hellraiser?${prompt};
The young'uns in my unit are eager and prepared to suit up at a moment's notice. All they need is for me to give the word.${prompt};
And as an added convenience, it appears that a sizeable chunk of the beastman force camping out about Jeuno is made up of Quadav--our specialty!${prompt};
Unlike us, though, the folks over in Jeuno haven't had much experience dealing with the turtlemen and their thick shells. That's why they've been having it rough all this time.${prompt};
Nobody here discounts the Duchy's strategic importance, that much we've established. If she were to fall to the beastmen, it'd only be a matter of time before the three nations follow suit.${prompt};
Let us go and lend a hand to our Jeunoan brothers and sisters, I say!${prompt};
I beg you to consider, Mister President. Rough-mannered as Zazarg is, I can attest to his leadership and prowess on the battlefield.${prompt};
Gahahahaha!${prompt};
Very well...;
Praefectus Zazarg, have your unit mobilized. I leave the matter in your hands.${prompt};
Now we're talking!;
Thank you, sir, Mister President, sir!${prompt};
The Seventh Cohors will strike out for Jeuno without delay.${prompt};
Th-thank you, sir!${prompt};
Gahahaha!;
Now, now, lil' missy. I haven't done anything deserving of such an enthusiastic display of gratitude.${prompt};
There's nothing special about helping out friends in need. And nationality sure as hell's got nothing to do with it, either. Am I right?${prompt};
Yes, sir!${prompt};
What is it? I'm buried up to my ears in duties right now. It'll have to wait.${prompt};
During wartime, nations tend to become fixated only on the happenings within their borders, blinding themselves to the bigger picture. We hope your mission to recruit Windurst's aid will be fruitful.${prompt};
We wish the Seventh Cohors every success on their mission. Perhaps we should strap some explosives onto Zazarg, as a precautionary measure.${prompt};
With supplies running dangerously low and fewer and fewer soldiers returning from the battlefield each day, the situation is indeed grim. It would seem that shortages are the only things we have in abundance...${prompt};
Looking for a half-Elvaan, half-Hume lass with a shock of red hair, eh?;
Sorry, but I've seen no one around here fitting that description.${prompt};
My records show that the ${choice-player-gender}[man/woman] you mention--${name-player}--is indeed an active member of the Seventh Cohors.${prompt};
Furnish me with a letter of introduction signed in ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] name, and we'll get you started on the aptitude test.${prompt};
You need a signed letter from ${name-player}?;
Y-you see, I've reasons to keep my induction a secret from ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]...${prompt};
Sorry, but your personal circumstances are none of my concern.;
If you can't provide the requested documentation, I'll have to see you off.${prompt};
Awww...${prompt};
Gahahaha! And what brings you here, lil' lady?;
Got a mind to join my jovial band of misfits, eh? Be all you can be?${prompt};
It just so happens that I've got this one task that wants for doin'.${prompt};
One of our men--Gebhardt's his name--is posted out in North Gustaberg, at a watchtower named Eduard. Silly name, I know.;
The deal is, we need supplies delivered there. Would you be up for it?${prompt};
B-but, sir! That...that's the aptitude test!${prompt};
I think I can remember my own test, soldier. And so what if we let her have a shot? It's no skin off our noses.;
We can worry about trivial details later.${prompt};
Off you go with these here supplies, lil' lady. We're countin' on you!${prompt};
Th-thank you for the opportunity, sir! I promise to be equal to the task!${prompt};
Hm?${prompt};
Like I said, haven't seen her like around here.;
If she ever comes by, though, I'll be sure to let you know.${prompt};
If she ever comes by, though, I'll be sure to let you know.${prompt};
Gahahaha! So that was you dancin' circles around them Orcs back in the bowels of Jeuno!;
This certainly puts things into perspective.${prompt};
Hehehe. It's very kind of you to remember, sir.${prompt};
Even a fool could see you've got both spirit and skill aplenty.;
You'd be a valuable addition to the Seventh Cohors, I've no doubt.${prompt};
<Gasp>!${prompt};
...But I'm afraid I can't grant your wish.${prompt};
Wh-what? But...why?${prompt};
You haven't so much as said it, but your motivation for joinin' us is none other than to help ${name-player}, correct?${prompt};
!!!${prompt};
Gahahahaha! Hit the nail smack-bang on the head, did I?;
You and ${name-player} are close, like ${choice-player-gender}[brother and sister/sisters]. I did see you two in action back at the Duchy, after all.${prompt};
But take my advice. If you're truly of a mind to help ${name-player}, don't just go blindly followin' ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] footsteps.;
Keep to your own path, and work towards becomin' the person that only you can be. That's how you build the foundation for an unbeatable team.${prompt};
Bein' ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] close comrade, you should know better than most that worries are wasted on ${name-player}.;
You might've already heard, but your friend's been leavin' ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] positive influence all over the Republic. Even the Mythril Musketeers--the president's right arm--hold ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] in high esteem. That says a great deal, doesn't it?${prompt};
Bein' ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] close comrade, you should know better than most that worries are wasted on ${name-player}.;
In the short time ${choice-player-gender}[he/she]'s been with the Seventh Cohors, ${name-player}'s already shown tremendous potential.${prompt};
What's more, I've got this feelin'...${prompt};
That distance, no matter how great, can never keep the two of you apart for long.${prompt};
...!${prompt};
So be at ease and keep walkin' your own path, lil' lady.;
${name-player}'s in good hands here, and that's a promise.${prompt};
Thank you, sir!${prompt};
Searchin' for someone, eh?;
Red hair, long ears, sassy...${prompt};
Hmmm...;
Sounds mighty familiar, but I can't for the life of me remember where from. Might've been a friend of a friend.${prompt};
Lilisette, ${name-player}, I thank you both for your cooperation.${prompt};
With your invaluable assistance, our mission to entreat the aid of the two nations was a success.${prompt};
All that remains now is to relay word to Jeuno and ensure that no acts of folly such as surrender take place.${prompt};
Yes, my lord!${prompt};
I fear this is where we must part. My duties require that I be at my king's side.${prompt};
Take this letter and see it safely to the hands of Archduke Kam'lanaut.${prompt};
After you have done so, be on standby to receive our knights upon their arrival.${prompt};
Understood, sir!${prompt};
May the Goddess keep you...${prompt};
Can't you see that I'm occupied with my duties?;
I'm far too busy defending this realm from the forces of darkness to engage in idle chit-chat with ungrateful civilians like you.;
Now, begone!${prompt};
Greetings!;
Your tireless efforts on behalf of the Allied Forces are well known in these parts!${prompt};
What a coincidence that you stopped by.;
As a matter of fact, I have an offer that might prove interesting for you.${prompt};
I'm not allowed to reveal my sources, but let it suffice to say that a substantial treasure hoard has been unearthed!${prompt};
The area in which this treasure was found was one recently annexed to our territory thanks in no small part to your valiant efforts, so I simply had to let you in on the news.${prompt};
There is one small catch, however.;
Word has it that a frightening monster has staked out the surrounding environs as its lair, and laid claim to the riches within.${prompt};
Ordinarily a reclusive beast, it has been sighted only on the rarest of occasions.;
In an odd coincidence, each of the search parties that encountered it happened to be carrying a ${keyitem-singular: 8[2]} at the time...${prompt};
Curious, is it not?;
Yet, as the rumor has spread, many brave souls are trying to get their hands on these ${keyitem-plural: 8[2]}, in the hope that they might draw out and slay the beast, and dispossess it of its treasure.${prompt};
Where can you get your hands on one, you ask? Ohoho...;
What would you say if I told you that I just happen to have one with me right here?${prompt};
I procured it from my...sources, just for you!;
After all, you have as much claim to the riches as any of those would-be treasure hunters.${prompt};
Mind you, these aren't easy to come by.;
If we didn't swear allegiance to the same nation, I'd have to charge a fee of ${number: 1} Allied Notes, but...${prompt};
Seeing as you're such a staunch ally to our cause, I'd be willing to let it go for only ${number: 0}.;
Do we have a deal?${prompt};
Deal? (You currently possess ${number: 2} A.N.);
${selection-lines};
Deal.;
No thanks.${prompt};
Really proceed with the transaction?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
On second thought...${prompt};
That's a shame.;
Well, if you change your mind, I suggest you come back quickly.;
Now that our forces occupy the area, there's no telling when the beast might move on to greener pastures...${prompt};
Wonderful! You won't regret it.;
With this, the treasure is as good as yours!${prompt};
I'm afraid you haven't enough Allied Notes...${prompt};
I'd appreciate if you could share this news with your comrades as well.;
A chance like this doesn't come every day, you know, and word has it there's more than enough treasure to go around.${prompt};
The monster lurks within the region recently brought under ${choice: 0}[San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] control.;
Make haste, and may the Goddess protect you!${prompt};
Oh, it's you again!;
Let me guess. You've come back for the ${keyitem-singular: 8[2]}.;
Am I right or am I right?${prompt};
How about it?;
${selection-lines};
Right you are.;
Actually, no...${prompt};
Yes? I'm afraid I have no time at the moment.;
Come back later, and we'll talk.${prompt};
Greetings and well met. I am a Voidwatch scientist charged with researching the potential uses of atmacite.${prompt};
Those who possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} may come to me to have their hard-won atmacite infused.;
Stratum abyssite also falls within my domain, so present to me any whose properties you wish to have analyzed.${prompt};
Ah, I'm also authorized to teleport folk to operation sites. Quite versatile, aren't I?${prompt};
I beg of you, friend. Lend us your stout sword arm in the fight to protect Vana'diel from the Voidwalker threat.${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing for now.;
Have stratum abyssite examined.;
Request teleportation.;
Analyze atmacite.;
Ask about atmacite.;
Ask about atmacite enrichment.${prompt};
What will you do?;

Yes.;
No.${prompt};
${name-player} expends ${number: 2} cruor and is now infused with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} (lv.${number: 1})!${prompt};
The atmacite could not be infused...${prompt};
${name-player} has been purged of the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} (lv.${number: 1}).${prompt};
You do not possess any atmacite capable of enrichment.${prompt};
${selection-lines};
None for now.;

Enriching the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} will produce the following:${prompt};
Enriching the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} from level ${number: 1} to level ${number: 2} requires ${number: 3} cruor.${prompt};
Enrich ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}?;
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has been enriched to its maximum level!${prompt};
The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...${prompt};
The atmacite could not be purged...${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} (lv.${number: 1}) bestows the following bonuses:${prompt};
${selection-lines};
Yes.;
No.${prompt};
Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul.;
Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.${prompt};
By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.${prompt};
At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.${prompt};
Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.${prompt};
That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.${prompt};
From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.${prompt};
But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.${prompt};
The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt};
Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all.;
As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.${prompt};
We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.${prompt};
Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level ${number: 0}. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.${prompt};
Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands.;
For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.${prompt};
Keep this in mind should the need arise to reconfigure your atmacite with haste.${prompt};
Examine which stratum abyssite?;
${selection-lines};
None right now.;
Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth.${prompt};
The stone shows signs indicative of growth, but the changes are yet too slight for untrained eyes to discern.${prompt};
Oh my, such a magnificent display of evolution!;
Leaves absolutely nothing to be desired!${prompt};
Why yes, this stone is showing the initial signs of evolution.;
It appears there's still room for growth, however.${prompt};
Hmmm... I fear this stone's growth has been interrupted.;
Were you to find a catalyst of sorts, perhaps it could still evolve further?${prompt};
Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth.;
Perhaps a catalyst of sorts could help to spur along the process?${prompt};
How curious. I've not seen a stone like this before.;
Wherever did you find it?${prompt};
Your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has evolved into ${keyitem-article: 1[2]}!${prompt};
Supply me with the ${number: 0} cruor necessary, and I shall gladly teleport you to an operation site of your choosing.${prompt};

I am a Voidwatch officer dispatched here by the ${choice: 0}[Grand Duchy of Jeuno/Allied Forces of Altana].;
My duty is to recruit able-bodied soldiers to assist in repelling the Voidwalker threat.${prompt};
I beseech you, friend. Lend your aid to our cause, lest our fair Vana'diel be engulfed in fire and brimstone.${prompt};
What will you do?;
${selection-lines};
Nothing for now.;
Ask a bunch of questions.;
Participate in Voidwatch Ops.;
Request debriefing.;
Request ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}.;
Request reward issuance.${prompt};
While I commend your enthusiasm, only those who possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} may participate in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is considered proof of one's valor and prowess, and is awarded only to those who have distinguished themselves in the three nations.${prompt};
Hmm... There appears to be no record of your service there.${prompt};
I'm sorry, but only those with military affiliation may participate in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt};
While your enthusiasm is heartening, the Voidwatch requires men and women of tested steel.;
Come back again once you have proven your worth.${prompt};
${color-alt: 121}You must be at least level ${number: 0} to participate in Voidwatch.;
Have a mind to lend us your aid? Splendid!${prompt};
I see you've yet to be issued ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.;
Here, take this and keep it on your person at all times.${prompt};
Stratum abyssite is needed to do battle with a Voidwalker at one of the many planar rifts that have manifested across the land.${prompt};
You can't simply use one wherever you like, mind you, for each stone is attuned only to rifts found in a certain region, or “jurisdiction.”${prompt};
Undertaking a Voidwatch operation in a specific jurisdiction requires that you obtain the corresponding stone from the presiding Voidwatch officer.${prompt};
While these stones are capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to their bearers, their powers can only be tapped when used in conjunction with ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};
Operations are presently underway at ${choice: 0}[East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.${prompt};
Operations are presently underway at ${choice: 0}[North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/the Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.${prompt};
Operations are presently underway at ${choice: 0}[West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.${prompt};
It would seem some other requirement exists besides the usual ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} and ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};
Rest assured, you will be apprised of this information as soon as we acquire it.${prompt};
At this time, we request your participation in the operation at ${choice: 0}[East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet].${prompt};
At this time, we request your participation in the operation at ${choice: 0}[North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/the Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg].${prompt};
At this time, we request your participation in the operation at ${choice: 0}[West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo].${prompt};
When you engage in battle with a Voidwalker, you do so as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of our dimension.;
The rules of such engagements are unlike any other, and I counsel you to proceed prepared and with all caution.${prompt};
Now, go and do Vana'diel proud!${prompt};
Ah, there's one thing that should be of interest to you.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} you possess--our researchers have discovered a most intriguing property about it.${prompt};
You see, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.${prompt};
Absorbing this energy causes the abyssite to evolve, or more accurately, makes it attuned to other planar rifts.;
This, of course, translates to an expanded sphere of Voidwatch Ops in which the bearer may participate.${prompt};
${choice: 1}[Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] ${choice: 0}[East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet].

Ah, I daresay your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} has undergone change!${prompt};
How many would you like?;
${selection-lines};
None.;
Just one.;
Fill me up!${prompt};
Here is your additional ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} allocation.;
Make each and every one count, you hear?${prompt};
It appears you already possess the maximum allocation of ${number: 0} stones.;
I'm not authorized to provision you with more.${prompt};
I'm afraid we're out of stock. The next shipment is expected to arrive in ${number: 0} ${choice-plurality: 0}[minute/minutes] (Earth time).${prompt};

Hm? It seems you already possess ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}.;
In that case, you won't be needing another.${prompt};
This periapt allows the bearer to infuse an additional atmacite for each one possessed.${prompt};
This periapt grants the bearer heightened insight into Voidwalker weaknesses against weapon skills and abilities.${prompt};
This periapt grants the bearer heightened insight into Voidwalker weaknesses against magic.${prompt};
This periapt enhances the effect granted by a periapt of guidance.${prompt};
This periapt enhances the effect granted by a periapt of percipience.${prompt};
A bewitching light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if beckoning its bearer to come hither.${prompt};
A tantalizing light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if appealing to its bearer's most ardent desires.${prompt};
A crazed light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if seeking to breach the bearer's last bastion of sanity.${prompt};

Voidstone consumption.${prompt};
“Voidwalker” is the name given to creatures that roam the realm between worlds.${prompt};
Little is known about them at this time, except that they're driven by an insatiable lust for destruction.${prompt};
While reports of Voidwalker encounters vary greatly in content, one thing is certain: the creatures are gaining in strength, a mounting threat that cannot be left unchecked.${prompt};
In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning adventurers to lend their aid.${prompt};
As the nature of Voidwalker battles renders full-scale military operations unfeasible, we have chosen to stake our success on the mobility and versatility of adventurers.${prompt};
In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning soldiers of the Allied Forces to lend their aid.${prompt};
To be sure, there're those who question the wisdom of thinning our ranks in the face of the Shadow Lord's armies. But I assure you, friend, the Voidwalker threat is no less real.${prompt};
Our scouts regularly bring back intel on locations of suspected Voidwalker presence.${prompt};
Armed with this information, we dispatch strike teams to preemptively neutralize the threat.${prompt};
Ordinarily, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.;
Only by using the voidstone's power can we force them to feel the sting of our steel.${prompt};
These magicked stones are distributed in regular shipments from our Jeuno-based research team.;
They're the bare minimum we need to have a fighting chance against the enemy.${prompt};
Voidstones work by realigning your existential spectrum to match that of Voidwalkers, thus rendering the creatures visible to you.${prompt};
The stones are highly prized, such is the difficulty of their creation. As such, supplies are limited to ${number: 0} stones per person at any given time.${prompt};
That's provided we have any in stock at all. Much time is required in imbuing them with requisite powers.${prompt};
The Voidwatch is an organization that exists for the sole purpose of protecting the world from extradimensional invaders we call “Voidwalkers.”${prompt};
Recognizing the graveness of this threat, the nations of the Middle Lands joined together in common cause and formed the Voidwatch.${prompt};
Helming the organization is the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, with the remaining three nations contributing resources for its operation.${prompt};
Possession of ${keyitem-article: 0[2]} is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt};
It can be earned only through loyal service to your nation, and thus serves as a testimonial for your prowess.${prompt};
You would do well to obtain one if you haven't already done so.${prompt};
Affiliation with the Allied Forces of Altana is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.${prompt};
In other words, you must belong to the armed forces of one of the three nations.${prompt};
The enlistment procedure varies depending on nation. Those wishing to obtain a recommendation letter should pay visit to one of the military encampments surrounding Jeuno.${prompt};
When you battle a Voidwalker, you must do so as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of the dimension who has harnessed the powers of the voidstone and stratum abyssite.${prompt};
Bereft of these two objects, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.${prompt};
However, there are a few points all budding Voidwatchers should bear in mind.${prompt};
Most crucial of all, the extradimensional nature of being a Voidwatcher renders you isolated and unable to receive help from the outside world.${prompt};
Scientists attribute this to the dimensional misalignment that occurs. As people are ordinarily unable to see Voidwalkers, so too are they unable to see you.${prompt};
But you needn't concern yourself with the hows and whys of such matters. It would behoove you far more to become familiar with the workings of the “existential spectrum.”${prompt};
You see, each dimension is composed of an existential spectrum to which all things within are aligned.;
In turn, the spectrum is formed of five lights: blue, red, yellow, green, and white.${prompt};
The alignment of these lights between Voidwalker and Voidwatcher plays an important role in our efforts.${prompt};
To elaborate, the act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning ourselves to its existential spectrum.${prompt};
Now, while Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with these creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.${prompt};
Compensating measures, however, have been developed to allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe.${prompt};
One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as “ascent items,” while another entails performing certain actions against the enemy.${prompt};
Both methods aim to manipulate the alignment value of individual lights to various ends.${prompt};
All five lights influence the contents of the treasure chest which appears at the successful end of battle.${prompt};
Our researchers have succeeded in determining what manner of benefits are associated with each light.${prompt};
For instance, improving blue spectral alignment is known to produce greater quantities of spoils.${prompt};
In contrast, manipulating red spectral alignment reportedly enhances the quality of individual items--potions becoming hi-potions, and so forth.${prompt};
Yellow and green, on the other hand, influence experience gain and cruor yield respectively.${prompt};
If you wish to know more about the curious red substance we call cruor, you need but ask.${prompt};
Lastly, we have white spectral alignment, which is unique even in this company.;
It has been determined to affect the appearance of transdimensional objects such as atmacite and periapt.${prompt};
Research regarding these artifacts is still ongoing.${prompt};
Lastly, be reassured that there're no known negative effects of manipulating spectral alignment. We unreservedly encourage all Voidwatch operatives to endeavor towards maximum alignment.${prompt};
Ascent items are unique objects that can be used to manipulate the spectral alignment of corresponding lights in the existential spectrum.${prompt};
They're the pride and joy of our Jeuno-based research team, who'd have folk believe they're the greatest inventions since airships.${prompt};
(Just between you and me, though, it is Far Eastern scientists that pioneered the technology they're based upon.)${prompt};
They're not the only means by which we manipulate spectral alignment, mind you. Similar results can be achieved by performing specific actions against the enemy.${prompt};
Truth be told, much is still shrouded in mystery. What actions will produce the desired effect is something you will have to discover for yourself through trial and error.${prompt};
Defeating a Voidwalker will cause a mysterious pyxis to emerge at the selfsame planar rift whence the creature was felled.${prompt};
Such riftworn pyxides exhibit a most peculiar characteristic: the content they bear reportedly changes depending on who glimpses within.${prompt};
Our scientists conjecture that this is due to some trick of spectral alignment. As with numerous other mysteries surrounding Voidwalkers, however, I highly doubt they have even an inkling of understanding.;
But I digress...${prompt};
Only one combatant need possess a voidstone for all party or alliance members to do battle with a Voidwalker. Of the other squad members only stratum abyssite is required.${prompt};
As always seems to be the case, however, there is a catch.;
Pyxides have been observed to yield less spoils for combatants without a voidstone of their own.${prompt};
It scarce needs be said, but it would be to your benefit to have both the aforementioned items readied before taking on a Voidwalker.${prompt};
Lastly, a warning: pyxides will eventually vanish if left untouched overlong.;
Our scientists have put forth the theory of normalizing spatial dissonance, but you needn't concern yourself with their mumbo-jumbo.${prompt};
Just see to it that your hard-earned spoils are claimed in good time, and things will be rosy for all involved.${prompt};
The ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} is a magicked object produced by the Voidwatch's Jeuno-based research wing.${prompt};
Its innocuous appearance belies the immense power it holds...the power to render Voidwalkers visible to its bearer.${prompt};
The stone achieves this feat by realigning our existential spectrum to that of the creature.${prompt};
I shall explain the process in layman's terms for your benefit. No need to thank me--I merely perform my duty.${prompt};
I want you to visualize two canvases, each the same distance from the other. Yes, as two separate objects are normally wont to be.${prompt};
Imagine you and I standing on one of the canvases--what else does one do with a canvas but stand on it, yes?${prompt};
Now, imagine Voidwalkers standing on the other canvas, doing whatever it is Voidwalkers do. Destroying things and behaving with utter impropriety, no doubt.${prompt};
Being on two different canvases, it follows that we cannot touch the Voidwalkers, let alone see them.;
Actually, that doesn't explain why we can't see the Voidwalkers...unless it's a magical canvas they're on that makes all things upon it invisible! Yes, that'll serve!${prompt};
And this brings us full circle back to the voidstone. I want you to think of it as a magical paintbrush that we use to...grapple ourselves over to the Voidwalkers' canvas. Thence the fighting begins.${prompt};
I trust you now have a rudimentary understanding of the process. That's all you need, really.;
Leave the fractal geometry to the fractal geometrists, I always say.${prompt};
As long as you remember the canvas and the paintbrush--that's the voidstone--you cannot go astray.;
Now, to apprise you of more practical matters...${prompt};
Twenty hours (Earth time) is required to produce a stone and imbue it with the necessary magicks, although word is that this may be shortened as research progresses.${prompt};
Mind you, this isn't the only variety of stone you'll be needing.;
There exists another: stratum abyssite.${prompt};
Whereas the voidstone serves as a power source, acting as a compass for channeling that power is stratum abyssite.;
Only by using the two in conjunction can we achieve our objectives.${prompt};
Put simply, it is a granular substance from which voidstones may be fabricated.${prompt};
As I explained, significant time is required to produce a voidstone from scratch.;
Provide me with voiddust, however, and I can fashion a stone for you in short order.${prompt};
The same comrades of ours who stock ascent items may also furnish you with voiddust.;
Why do they not fabricate the stones themselves, or deliver the dust directly to me?;
Shush! The Voidwatch works in mysterious ways, and it would behoove you to inquire no further.${prompt};
Simple enough, wouldn't you say?${prompt};
Furthermore, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.${prompt};
Based on the evolutionary state of your stratum abyssite, the Voidwatch will direct you to a suitable operation area.${prompt};
If you wish to have your stone analyzed, simply present it to an atma refiner.${prompt};
Planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space--have manifested across the land.;
The Voidwalker hordes roam beyond, unchecked and ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.${prompt};
By invoking the power of stratum abyssite, it is possible to battle the fell creatures as a “Voidwatcher”--a defender of our dimension.${prompt};
Those also possessed of a voidstone will find their Voidwatcher experience greatly enhanced.${prompt};
"Alone, however, stratum abyssite serves no purpose; only when used in conjunction with a voidstone can its powers be unleashed.${prompt}";
Hence, at least one member of your squad--be it party or alliance--must possess a voidstone in order to arrange a confrontation with a Voidwalker.${prompt};
Keep this fact in mind at all times.${prompt};
It is not known when the planar rifts first manifested. Some say they've always been there, while others claim recent events have triggered their appearance.${prompt};
If only we could return to the past, perhaps we could shed some light upon this mystery...${prompt};
Obtainable by defeating Voidwalkers, cruor is an energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.${prompt};
While appearing to be some manner of mineral, detailed analysis has revealed that cruor is in fact organic.${prompt};
As far as our researchers can tell, however, it's inanimate like most well-behaved plants.;
There's no fear of cruor suddenly springing to life in your palms.${prompt};
Being supremely pleasing to the eyes, cruor might have adorned the display cases of many a jewelry shop during peacetime. Unfortunately, the age demands that its unique properties be put to more practical uses.${prompt};
Namely, the infusion and enrichment of atmacite.;
If you wish to learn about these two processes, you need but ask an atmacite refiner, our experts on such matters.${prompt};
As cruor is a vital aspect of our operations, the Voidwatch is always looking to procure more. Should you have any excess cruor, we would be glad to take it off your hands and offer you useful items in exchange.${prompt};
Abyssite is the name given to a mysterious stone that assumes various forms and colors, the roles they serve likewise manifold in nature.${prompt};
Of the copious varieties thus far discovered, there exist those called “periapt”--lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.${prompt};
Defeating a Voidwalker is known to yield periapt on very rare occasions. Serve the Voidwatch earnestly, however, and you will surely have one to call your own.${prompt};

Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo!;
Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?${prompt};
Do something, kupo?;
${selection-lines};
Porter service?;
Buy a storage slip.;
No, thank you.${prompt};
Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over?;
Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.${prompt};
That's where I come in, kupo.;
I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.${prompt};
To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of ${number: 19} gil.${prompt};
Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.${prompt};
You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt};
Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt};
Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.;
I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt};
Invisible to you, at least.;
It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt};
When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt};
I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.;
Simple as that, kupo!${prompt};
What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!;
Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt};
Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.;
So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt};
For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt};
Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect!;
It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt};
Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt};
If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!;
No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”;
Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt};
Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.${prompt};
If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.${prompt};

At ease. Don't worry about me--I'm safe as ever.${prompt};
Ah, ${name-player}. My heart and mind are ready to go, but I'd be lying if I said my body was fully willing to cooperate.${prompt};
Funny that you should come right as I was debriefing Zeid. I'd like to share with you what I told him.${prompt};
Thanks to the lot of you, I was able to come to my senses and regain control of my spirit.${prompt};
I'd like to share with you and future generations what I learned and felt while in the thrall of the Marquis.${prompt};
Demons are able to control peoples' hearts. This much you know.${prompt};
Have you wondered why? It's because they understand us so well. They take hold of the darkness within each of us and use it to slink into us and control our very bodies.${prompt};
However, you were able to save me because of one critical difference.${prompt};
Simply put, demons lack the capacity to love.${prompt};
That's the one thing that keeps us human and is essential to the fabric of our being.${prompt};
Captain Klara, hearing you speak of love soothes my heart!${prompt};
I would imagine so, Gentle Tiger.${prompt};
I would never have realized what love really meant...${prompt};
If I hadn't been possessed by Marquis Amon.${prompt};
Yes! Yes! A strong, strong love...one that can overcome our differences!${prompt};
You speak the truth. Guarding the gate all this time has enabled you to interact with people of all different races and backgrounds.${prompt};
And you, ${name-player}, will surely come to the same conclusion if you see all the world has to offer. Or, perhaps, you already know the truth for yourself.${prompt};
I'd explain it to you, but it's difficult to put into words.${prompt};
Allow me to think for a moment about love and what it means to me.${prompt};
U-urk! Captain Klara! There are two of her!${prompt};
Why so jumpy?${prompt};
B-b-but...of course I'd be jumpy!${prompt};
I'd never thought such a thing possible, but for some reason, it's not surprising in the least.${prompt};
Love can bring about miracles that ordinary men couldn't imagine.${prompt};
(Wh-when did Captain Klara become so prophetic...?)${prompt};
Z-Zeid, look! There's two Captain Klaras! Something's wrong, right? It's impossible, right!?${prompt};
You've reached a higher pinnacle than I would have thought possible, Klara. I'm glad I was here to witness your achievement.${prompt};
I, too, must do my best to equal her lofty heights!${prompt};
I wish I could put my finger on just why the two of them have that special spark...${prompt};
Maybe it's not for me to understand. I'm just a guard, and so I'll remain for all my days.${prompt};
