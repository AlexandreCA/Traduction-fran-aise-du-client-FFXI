Surprising that an advanced country like Bastok could fall behind in conquests... That Hume technology can't do everything, I guess.${prompt};......${prompt}
I'm not too fond of the folksy-wolksy in these parts. All important with their noses in the air and their tails a-waving, but cheap as can be. You folk from other countries need to get cracking!${prompt};Surprenant qu'un pays avancé comme Bastok puisse être à la traîne dans les conquêtes...

Them Elvaan sure are strong with their pointy ears and pointy swords! San d'Oria's sure to be in the lead for a long while yet!${prompt};Je ne suis pas trop fan des gens d'ici.

...Please...enjoy...${prompt};Ce pays... est... effrayant...${prompt}
Can't you see I'm busy now? Give a girl a little brrreathing room, huh?${prompt};...Veuillez...profiter...${prompt}
Heh-heh-heh...;Vous ne voyez pas que je suis occupée maintenant ? Donnez un peu d'espace à une fille, hein ?${prompt}
I wouldn't wander around this area unless you have good reason to... It could be dangerrrous!${prompt};Heh-heh-heh...
Haven't you ever heard the name of “Nanaa Mihgo”? Well, this is herrr house!${prompt};Je ne me promènerais pas dans cette zone à moins d'avoir une bonne raison... Cela pourrait être dangerrreux !${prompt}
We only take orders from the top cat. When she says, “Jump!”, we say, “How high?”...and we always land on our feet, of course.${prompt};"Vous n'avez jamais entendu parler de ""Nanaa Mihgo"" ? Eh bien, c'est sa maison !${prompt}"
Grrr...;"Nous ne prenons des ordres que du grand chef. Quand elle dit, ""Saute !"", on dit, ""À quelle hauteur ?"" ... et on retombe toujours sur nos pattes, bien sûr.${prompt}"
You don't seem to understand how harrrd being a member of her gang is, do you?${prompt};Grrr...
Humph...;Vous ne semblez pas comprendre à quel point il est difficile d'être membre de sa bande, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Looks like that Nanaa Mihgo, better known as the Cat Burglar, is at her home forrr once.${prompt};Hum...
An adventurer such as yourself ought to be careful, lest you get burrrned.${prompt};On dirait que cette Nanaa Mihgo, mieux connue sous le nom de la Cambrioleuse, est enfin chez elle.${prompt}
So, who do you think you arrre? You want to crrrawl up to me, do you?${prompt};Un aventurier tel que vous devrait faire attention, de peur de se faire brûler.${prompt}
Well, if you bring me a little something as a sign of your desire to be my frrriend, I might just considerrr the possibility...${prompt};Alors, qui pensez-vous être ? Vous voulez ramper jusqu'à moi, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Haven't I seen you somewhere beforrre? Weren't you the one running with those pack of brrrats from the port area?${prompt};Eh bien, si vous m'apportez quelque chose comme signe de votre désir d'être mon ami, je pourrais juste envisager la possibilité...${prompt}
So you've come to apologize, have you? Well, you had better bring me a little something to show your desire to be my frrriend! Then I'll consider whether to forrrgive you or not...${prompt};Ne vous ai-je pas vu quelque part auparavant ? N'étiez-vous pas celui qui courait avec cette bande de garnements du port ?${prompt}
Well, if you want to be all chummy with me, you had better bring me a token offerrring firrrst. I'll be waiting... Hah!${prompt};Alors vous êtes venu vous excuser, n'est-ce pas ? Eh bien, vous feriez mieux de m'apporter quelque chose pour montrer votre désir d'être mon ami ! Ensuite, j'envisagerai si je dois vous pardonner ou non...${prompt}
What's that? You're contemplating taking something to Nanaa Mihgo?${prompt};Eh bien, si vous voulez être tout amical avec moi, vous feriez mieux d'apporter une offrande symbolique d'abord. J'attendrai... Ha !${prompt}
I recommend you forrrget that! She'll take you in, all right, but not the way you expect! Haven't you heard that she's involved with some nasty foreign mob? Be carrreful!${prompt};Qu'est-ce que c'est ? Vous envisagez d'apporter quelque chose à Nanaa Mihgo ?${prompt}
What? You want to make frrriends with Nanaa Mihgo? Well, you've got no chance of that right now, have you?${prompt};Je te conseille d'oublier ça ! Elle t'acceptera, c'est sûr, mais pas comme tu l'espères ! Tu n'as pas entendu dire qu'elle est impliquée avec une méchante mafia étrangère ? Fais attention !${prompt}
If you want to run with the top cat, you'll have to be the right kind of rogue firrrst!${prompt};Quoi ? Tu veux te faire ami avec Nanaa Mihgo ? Eh bien, tu n'as aucune chance pour l'instant, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
We crrrawled up to the top cat by taking her four ${item-plural: 1[2]} each. That's how she accepted us! You think you can match that?${prompt};Si tu veux courir avec le grand chef, tu devras d'abord être le bon type de voyou !${prompt}
You can get your paws on ${item-plural: 1[2]} by defeating those Yagudo beastmen. But you won't please the Tarutaru very much if you go arrround fighting Yagudo!${prompt};Nous sommes montés jusqu’au grand chef en lui apportant quatre ${item-plural: 1[2]} chacun. C’est ainsi qu’elle nous a acceptés ! Tu penses pouvoir faire pareil ?${prompt}
Windurst is currently trying to maintain amicable relations with the Yagudo. It's a very different worrrld from what it was twenty years ago...${prompt};Tu peux mettre la main sur ${item-plural: 1[2]} en battant ces bêtes Yagudo. Mais tu ne plairas pas beaucoup aux Tarutaru si tu te promènes en combattant les Yagudo !${prompt}
Trying to win Nanaa Mihgo over is a waste of time! The most she will do is rrreturn your kindness with hostility.${prompt};Windurst essaie actuellement de maintenir des relations amicales avec les Yagudo. C'est un monde très différent de celui d'il y a vingt ans...${prompt}
Looking at her, I rrrealize it's not a person's birth, but their upbringing, that determines who they become.${prompt};Essayer de gagner Nanaa Mihgo est une perte de temps ! Au mieux, elle te rendra ta gentillesse par de l'hostilité.${prompt}
Purrr... For you to bring me these implies my two followers out in front let the cat out of the bag.${prompt};En la regardant, je réalise que ce n'est pas la naissance d'une personne, mais son éducation, qui détermine qui elle devient.${prompt}
Well, anyway, I'll accept these as a token of your esteem. And if you happen by any more of these, then give them to me, and I'll make it worrrth your while.;Purrr... Pour que tu m'apportes cela, cela implique que mes deux acolytes à l'avant ont vendu la mèche.${prompt}
Farewell now.${prompt};Eh bien, de toute façon, j'accepterai cela comme un signe de ton estime. Et si tu en trouves d'autres, donne-les-moi et je te récompenserai.
Just 'cause I accepted your token of esteem doesn't mean you can get away with murderrr!${prompt};Adieu maintenant.${prompt}
You have to do things my way if you don't want me getting all catty on you!;Ce n'est pas parce que j'ai accepté ton signe d'estime que tu peux t'en tirer à bon compte !${prompt}
Now, goodbye and ta-ta!${prompt};Tu dois faire les choses à ma manière si tu ne veux pas que je devienne agressive !
${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 1[2]} are illegal contraband, so they naturally fetch a high price through the properrr channels.${prompt};Maintenant, au revoir et à bientôt !${prompt}
So curious little catspaws like you are more than welcome! With your help, we'll make a killing!${prompt};${lettercase: 1}${item-plural: 1[2]} sont de la contrebande illégale, donc ils se vendent naturellement à un prix élevé par les canaux appropriés.${prompt}
Humph!;Donc, les petits curieux comme toi sont plus que bienvenus ! Avec ton aide, nous allons faire un malheur !${prompt}
You just did as I said and gave the top cat some ${item-plural: 1[2]}, didn't you?${prompt};Hum !
Well, that's just being a copycat! Don't think you're any better than us, or else fur will fly!${prompt};Tu as juste fait ce que j'ai dit et donné au grand chef quelques ${item-plural: 1[2]}, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Purrr... For you to bring me these implies my two followers out in front let the cat out of the bag.${prompt};Eh bien, c'est juste du copier-coller ! Ne pense pas que tu es meilleur que nous, sinon les poils voleront !${prompt}
Well, anyway, apology accepted. Just be more careful next time! And if you happen by any more of these, then hand them to me, and I'll make it worrrth your while.;Purrr... Pour que tu m'apportes cela, cela implique que mes deux acolytes à l'avant ont vendu la mèche.${prompt}
Farewell now.${prompt};Eh bien, de toute façon, excuses acceptées. Sois juste plus prudent la prochaine fois ! Et si tu trouves d'autres de ces choses, donne-les-moi et je te récompenserai.
Judging by its feel, I'd swear this is a prrrecious stone of some type, but I seem to be losing my instinct on this one...${prompt};Adieu maintenant.${prompt}
Grrr...;À en juger par sa texture, je jurerais qu'il s'agit d'une pierre précieuse, mais je semble perdre mon instinct sur celle-ci...${prompt}
Who do you think you are? You shouldn't go sneaking around people's homes...you might be mistaken as a burglar!${prompt};Grrr...
But I'll let you off this time...that is, if you can tell me what this stone is!${prompt};Pour qui te prends-tu ? Tu ne devrais pas te faufiler dans les maisons des gens... on pourrait te prendre pour un voleur !${prompt}
As farrr as I can tell, it looks just like a plain rock, but it may be some kind of ore or something. I wonderrr...${prompt};Mais je te laisse passer cette fois... c'est-à-dire si tu peux me dire ce qu'est cette pierre !${prompt}
Hey, that's it...! I have a little job for you! Carrre to go to the Goldsmiths' Guild in Bastok and ask them what in Vana'diel this is?${prompt};Autant que je puisse en juger, elle ressemble à un simple caillou, mais c'est peut-être un type de minerai ou quelque chose comme ça. Je me demande...${prompt}
Agree to help?;Hé, c'est ça...! J'ai un petit travail pour toi ! Tu veux bien aller à la Guilde des Orfèvres à Bastok et leur demander ce qu'est ce truc dans Vana'diel ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Accepter d'aider ?
Accept.;${selection-lines}
Decline.${prompt};Accepter.
Neverrr mind.;Refuser.${prompt}
I'll just throw this at...I mean, to...the kids who follow me around.${prompt};Peu importe.
If it isn't worth much, then go ahead and sell it to the Goldsmiths' Guild. Just make sure you bring the prrroceeds back to me, okay?${prompt};Je vais juste lancer cela...je veux dire, donner...aux enfants qui me suivent.${prompt}
Head over to the Goldsmiths' Guild in Bastok and ask them what that stone is.${prompt};Si ça ne vaut pas grand-chose, alors vends-le à la Guilde des Orfèvres. Assure-toi simplement de me rapporter le produit de la vente, d'accord ?${prompt}
If it isn't worrrth much, then sell it to the Goldsmiths' Guild. Just be sure you bring the proceeds from the sale back to me, okay?${prompt};Va à la Guilde des Orfèvres à Bastok et demande-leur ce qu'est cette pierre.${prompt}
So, did you make it to the Goldsmiths' Guild in Bastok? Good for you! And how much did you get for that lump of rrrock?${prompt};Si ça ne vaut pas grand-chose, alors vends-le à la Guilde des Orfèvres. Assure-toi simplement de me rapporter le produit de la vente, d'accord ?${prompt}
Oh...You didn't sell it? Well, go back to Bastok and sell it, then.;Alors, tu es allé à la Guilde des Orfèvres à Bastok ? Bien pour toi ! Et combien as-tu obtenu pour ce morceau de pierre ?${prompt}
Now, get going!${prompt};Oh...Tu ne l'as pas vendu ? Eh bien, retourne à Bastok et vends-le alors.
Well, if we've only learned one thing, it's this--it's farrr better to set our sights on the travelers in the port area.${prompt};Maintenant, va-t'en !${prompt}
The travelers in Windurst Woods are all merchants who keep their guard up, or the occasional idiot who carries around a strange rock as if it's a precious jewel. Not worth the efforrrt, is it?${prompt};Eh bien, si nous avons appris une chose, c’est ceci : il vaut bien mieux viser les voyageurs dans la zone portuaire.${prompt}
Seems the top cat herrrself can make mistakes sometimes. Picking pebbles from the pockets of passers-by...;Les voyageurs dans les Bois de Windurst sont tous des marchands sur leurs gardes, ou l’occasionnel idiot qui se promène avec une étrange pierre comme si c’était un bijou précieux. Pas la peine d'y faire des efforrrts, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
My ass-onance! She's got me talking-walking like a Tarutaru now!${prompt};On dirait que la grande chef elle-même peut parfois faire des erreurs. Ramasser des cailloux dans les poches des passants...
Oops...!;Mon assonance ! Elle m'a fait parler-marcher comme un Tarutaru maintenant !${prompt}
Keep what I said just now a secret, okay? Parrrticularly keep it from the top cat!${prompt};Oups...!
Ah!;Garde ce que j'ai dit pour toi, d'accord ? Particulièrement ne le dis pas à la grande chef !${prompt}
Don't tell me you sold off my rock for that dismal sum!${prompt};Ah !
Grrr... If you hadn't sold it off, we could have received a bigger reward from that silly traveler for finding it...;Ne me dis pas que tu as vendu ma pierre pour cette somme dérisoire !${prompt}
Oh well... It's no longer worth my bother.${prompt};Grrr... Si tu ne l'avais pas vendue, nous aurions pu recevoir une plus grande récompense de ce voyageur stupide pour l'avoir retrouvée...
Ahhh...;Bon, tant pis... Ça ne vaut plus la peine de m'en soucier.${prompt}
I traveled all the way here from Bastok, but I lost the stone that was the purpose of my journey.${prompt};Ahhh...
Hm?;J'ai voyagé jusqu'ici depuis Bastok, mais j'ai perdu la pierre qui était le but de mon voyage.${prompt}
What kind of stone did I lose?${prompt};Hm ?
It was a rock that we found in the Palborough Mines, north of Bastok. It had small traces of mythril in it.${prompt};Quel genre de pierre ai-je perdue ?${prompt}
But that's not all...;C'était une roche que nous avons trouvée dans les Mines de Palborough, au nord de Bastok. Elle contenait de petites traces de mithril.${prompt}
Besides the mythril, there's some unknown magic source in it.${prompt};Mais ce n'est pas tout...
If you mention magic, then you think of Windurst, right? I was hoping to get the Rhinostery to check it out, so I came all the way here.${prompt};En plus du mithril, il y a une source de magie inconnue à l'intérieur.${prompt}
But now that I've lost the rock in question, I'm stumped. After all the dangers I went through to get my hands on that rock, too... Boy, am I at my wits' end!${prompt};Si on parle de magie, on pense à Windurst, non ? J'espérais que le Rhinostery l'examine, alors je suis venu jusqu'ici.${prompt}
I spread the word that I'd pay a reward to the one who finds my ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but didn't get a single response.${prompt};Mais maintenant que j'ai perdu la pierre en question, je suis perplexe. Après tous les dangers que j'ai traversés pour mettre la main sur cette pierre... Je suis vraiment à bout de nerfs !${prompt}
Guess I'll have to go back to the depths of the Palborough Mines and dig up another one...but that place is so dangerous, and...how can I show my face in Bastok!?${prompt};J’ai annoncé que je paierais une récompense à celui qui retrouverait mon ${item-singular: 1[2]}, mais je n’ai reçu aucune réponse.${prompt}
Oh...! Ooohhhww...!;Je vais devoir retourner dans les profondeurs des Mines de Palborough et en déterrer une autre... mais cet endroit est tellement dangereux, et... comment puis-je montrer mon visage à Bastok !?${prompt}
Just when I had given up hope, too! Thank you! Thank you ever so much!${prompt};Oh...! Ooohhhww...!
How can I ever repay you? Words cannot express my gratitude, so here, please accept this...${prompt};Juste au moment où j'avais perdu tout espoir ! Merci ! Merci beaucoup !${prompt}
Now I can show my face in Bastok again! Words will never express my gratitude...;Comment puis-je jamais te rembourser ? Les mots ne peuvent exprimer ma gratitude, alors accepte ceci, s'il te plaît...${prompt}
Just...thank you!${prompt};Maintenant, je peux montrer mon visage à Bastok à nouveau ! Les mots ne pourront jamais exprimer ma gratitude...
Thanks for your help the other day! I took that stone and left it with the Rhinostery.${prompt};Juste... merci !${prompt}
Guess I'll just do some sightseeing until the results come back. Then again...I've already seen every nook and cranny of this place while I was searching frantically for the stone I lost!${prompt};Merci pour ton aide l'autre jour ! J'ai pris cette pierre et l'ai laissée au Rhinostery.${prompt}
This is the eastern gatehouse--a gathering place for the guards who do the rrrounds of Windurst Woods.${prompt};Je vais juste faire un peu de tourisme en attendant les résultats. En fait... J'ai déjà vu chaque recoin de cet endroit en cherchant frénétiquement la pierre que j'avais perdue !${prompt}
If you're after a map of Windurst, then head to the opening back up there. There's a Mithra merchant selling them there.${prompt};Voici la porte de l'est--un lieu de rassemblement pour les gardes qui patrouillent dans les Bois de Windurst.${prompt}
How arrre you～?;Si tu cherches une carte de Windurst, dirige-toi vers l'ouverture là-haut. Une marchande Mithra en vend là-bas.${prompt}
I'm fine, as always...I think.${prompt};Comment vas-tu～?
We've been having a spot of trouble because of those Yagudo beastmen, but Captain Rakoh Buuma's on hand, so things are underrr control...I think.${prompt};Je vais bien, comme toujours...je pense.${prompt}
Arrre you going to fight the good fight along with us? That'd be grrreat...I think. Speak to Captain Rakoh Buuma and she'll set you right!${prompt};Nous avons eu quelques soucis à cause de ces bêtes Yagudo, mais le Capitaine Rakoh Buuma est sur place, alors les choses sont sous contrôle... enfin, je pense.${prompt}
He～y, you seem to be from another country...I think. If you'rrre looking for the Consulate of ${choice: 2}[San d'Oria/Bastok], then it's ${choice: 2}[in this area/west of here]...${choice: 2}[across the Bomingo Round/in Port Windurst].${prompt};Allez-vous vous joindre à nous pour combattre le bon combat ? Ce serait génial... enfin, je pense. Parlez au Capitaine Rakoh Buuma et elle vous mettra dans le bon chemin !${prompt}
What are you staring at? Haven't you ever seen a Mithra beforrre?${prompt};Heu, vous semblez être d’un autre pays... enfin, je pense. Si vous cherchez le Consulat de ${choice: 2}[San d’Oria/Bastok], alors c’est ${choice: 2}[dans cette région/à l’ouest d’ici]...${choice: 2}[de l’autre côté du Bomingo Round/dans le Port Windurst].${prompt}
Here in Windurst Woods, there arrre many Mithra. You'll soon get over it...${prompt};Qu’est-ce que vous regardez ? Vous n’avez jamais vu une Mithra avant ?${prompt}
This is Windurst Woods, the Mithra part of town! We Mithra have to stick together, so feel welcome, frrriend!${prompt};Ici dans les Bois de Windurst, il y a beaucoup de Mithra. Vous vous y habituerez bientôt...${prompt}
I, I, erm, am one of the guards here.;C’est les Bois de Windurst, la partie de la ville des Mithra ! Nous, les Mithra, devons rester solidaires, alors sentez-vous le bienvenu, ami !${prompt}
<gulp>...;Je, je suis l'une des gardes ici.
Well, erm, nice to meety-weety you!${prompt};<gloups>...
I, I'm still getting used to it, erm, here... But I'm trying-wrying my besty!${prompt};Eh bien, euh, enchantée de vous rencontrer !${prompt}
ERROR:;Je, je m’habitue encore ici... mais j’essaie de faire de mon mieux !${prompt}

The, the Hume guys all say they envy-wenvy me, you know, being surrounded by Mithra ladies all day and everything... B-but, to tell you the truth, I get really tired-wired, day in and day out.${prompt};Refuser la mission.${prompt}
Rrreally, now!?;Les gars Hume disent tous qu'ils m'envient, vous savez, être entouré de dames Mithra toute la journée et tout ça... M-mais, pour vous dire la vérité, je suis vraiment fatigué, jour après jour.${prompt}
Of course, you can leave the rrreal monster-slaying work to Buuma's Boomers!${prompt};Vraiment, maintenant !?
I'd prefer to give you the work we find the most trying, such as the more delicate missions. Then again, any task involving Tarutaru is delicate in our opinion...${prompt};Bien sûr, vous pouvez laisser le vrai travail de chasse aux monstres aux Boomers de Buuma !${prompt}
This is the easterrrn gatehouse.;Je préférerais vous confier le travail que nous trouvons le plus difficile, comme les missions plus délicates. Enfin, toute tâche impliquant des Tarutaru est délicate à notre avis...${prompt}
Feel free to ask Captain Rakoh Buuma whenever you need a helping paw from Buuma's Boomerrrs! She's the grrreatest!${prompt};C'est la guérite orientale.
The, the Mithra ladies are normally very p-pleasant and ch-cheery, but you've got to keep on your toesy-woesies!${prompt};N'hésitez pas à demander au Capitaine Rakoh Buuma quand vous avez besoin d'un coup de patte des Boomers de Buuma ! Elle est la meilleure !${prompt}
Once, I, erm, nodded off for a bit, and, and, woke up to find bite marks on my leggy-leg-legs! I, I, erm, don't want to be eatened!!!${prompt};Les dames Mithra sont normalement très agréables et joyeuses, mais vous devez rester sur vos gardes !${prompt}
That Meeri-Wohri is a clumsy little nerrrvous wreck, y'know?${prompt};Un jour, je me suis assoupi un peu et, et, je me suis réveillé pour trouver des marques de morsure sur mes jambes ! Je, je ne veux pas être mangé !!!${prompt}
One day, I awoke from a cat nap wherrre I was having this dream about eating a Mithkabob, only to find I was chewing on the little guy's leg! I hope I didn't hurrrt him...to～o much.${prompt};Ce Meeri-Wohri est un petit nerveux maladroit, vous savez ?${prompt}
This is the eastern gatehouse--a gathering place for the guards who do the rrrounds of Windurst Woods.${prompt};Un jour, je me suis réveillé d'une petite sieste où je rêvais de manger un Mithkabob, seulement pour découvrir que je mâchais la jambe du petit gars ! J'espère ne pas lui avoir fait trop de mal...${prompt}
To expel those who would subvert the law and order of Windurst Woods...;C'est la guérite orientale - un lieu de rassemblement pour les gardes qui patrouillent dans les Bois de Windurst.${prompt}
To protect the Mithra populace from all manner of threats and dangers...;Expulser ceux qui voudraient subvertir la loi et l'ordre des Bois de Windurst...
That is the job of us guards.${prompt};Protéger la population Mithra de toutes sortes de menaces et dangers...
But lately, ferocious monsters are on the increase, and the beastmen are rrruining nature as they please, so our job is becoming all the more hectic.${prompt};C'est le travail des gardes.${prompt}
If you are a citizen of Windurst, then perhaps you may lend us a helping hand from time to time in order to protect the peace of our fair town.${prompt};Mais ces derniers temps, les monstres féroces sont en augmentation, et les bêtes détruisent la nature à leur guise, donc notre travail devient de plus en plus hectique.${prompt}
For instance, you could try to do some missions...special tasks issued on behalf of the Federation of Windurst...${prompt};Si vous êtes citoyen de Windurst, peut-être pourriez-vous nous donner un coup de main de temps en temps afin de protéger la paix de notre belle ville.${prompt}
But first, you might prefer to listen to our explanation of the rrrole of gatehouses before you decide...${prompt};Par exemple, vous pourriez essayer de faire des missions... des tâches spéciales émises au nom de la Fédération de Windurst...${prompt}
Hear explanation of gatehouses?;Mais d'abord, vous préféreriez peut-être écouter notre explication sur le rôle des guérites avant de décider...${prompt}
${selection-lines};Écouter l'explication des guérites ?
Hear! Hear!;${selection-lines}
Turn a deaf ear.${prompt};Écouter ! Écouter !
Good, then allow us to explain. Sola Jaab, would you like to do the honors?${prompt};Faire la sourde oreille.${prompt}
Roger, Captain Buuma!;Bien, permettez-nous alors d'expliquer. Sola Jaab, voulez-vous vous charger de l'honneur ?${prompt}
It would indeed be an honorrr...${prompt};Bien reçu, Capitaine Buuma !
Well, put simply, the gatehouses are where we guards worrrk and rest.${prompt};Ce serait en effet un honneur...${prompt}
We also administer missions herrre--assignments for and on behalf of our country.${prompt};En résumé, les guérites sont là où nous, les gardes, travaillons et nous reposons.${prompt}
Missions differ from plain quests in that they are rendered as service to your country, so the government will award you rank points forrr each mission you accomplish.${prompt};Nous administrons également des missions ici - des missions pour et au nom de notre pays.${prompt}
Register enough points and your rank, or standing in society, will incrrrease.${prompt};Les missions diffèrent des quêtes simples en ce qu'elles sont rendues comme un service à votre pays, donc le gouvernement vous accordera des points de rang pour chaque mission que vous accomplissez.${prompt}
So how about it?;Enregistrer suffisamment de points fera augmenter votre rang, ou votre position dans la société.${prompt}
If you consider yourself a model citizen of Windurst, I rrrecommend you serve your country by trying your hand at missions.${prompt};Alors, qu'en pensez-vous ?
The very rrreason that you came to Windurst in the first place was because you wanted to make something out of yourself, wasn't it?${prompt};Si vous vous considérez comme un citoyen modèle de Windurst, je vous recommande de servir votre pays en essayant votre chance avec les missions.${prompt}
Receive a mission?;La raison même pour laquelle vous êtes venu à Windurst en premier lieu était parce que vous vouliez vous faire une place, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Recevoir une mission ?
Accept.;${selection-lines}
Decline.${prompt};Accepter.
Well, I guess there's little more to say than “Maybe next time,” eh?${prompt};Refuser.${prompt}
So you don't need to know about gatehouses, eh? I don't suppose you'll be interested in taking on any missions, then...?${prompt};"Eh bien, je suppose qu'il n'y a pas grand-chose de plus à dire que ""Peut-être la prochaine fois"", hein ?${prompt}"
Well said!;Alors, vous n'avez pas besoin de connaître les guérites, hein ? Je suppose que vous ne serez pas intéressé à prendre des missions, alors... ?${prompt}
That heartfelt rrreply is your first great step towards making Windurst a better place.${prompt};Bien dit !
So, without further delay, let's issue you your first mission. Do either of you have just the rrright mission for ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]?${prompt};Cette réponse sincère est votre premier grand pas vers l'amélioration de Windurst.${prompt}
Said like a real woman!;Alors, sans plus tarder, émettons votre première mission. Avez-vous juste la bonne mission pour ${choice-player-gender}[lui/elle] ?${prompt}
That heartfelt reply is your first great step towards making Windurst a better place.${prompt};Dit comme une vraie femme !
So, without further delay, let's issue you with your first mission. Do either of you have just the rrright mission for our sister here?${prompt};Cette réponse sincère est votre premier grand pas vers l'amélioration de Windurst.${prompt}
Ex...excusey me...;Alors, sans plus tarder, émettons votre première mission. Avez-vous juste la bonne mission pour notre sœur ici ?${prompt}
But, I, erm, I know of a mission-wission...${prompt};Ex... excusez-moi...
You see...well...erm...;Mais, euh, je connais une mission...${prompt}
The Orastery in the port area is kinda looking for someone to help them with a magic experiment to be conducted at the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt};Vous voyez... eh bien... euh...
I know it's a little sudden-wudden, but they said they were in a fix because they couldn't find anyone to help them. So, erm, how about it then...?${prompt};L'Orasterie dans la zone portuaire cherche un volontaire pour les aider dans une expérience magique à mener aux Ruines de Horutoto.${prompt}
Good. Carry out that mission!;Je sais que c'est un peu soudain, mais ils ont dit qu'ils étaient dans l'embarras car ils ne trouvaient personne pour les aider. Alors, euh, qu'en pensez-vous... ?${prompt}
The Orastery is the ministry that rrruns a Mage Academy to improve the military's magic abilities.${prompt};Bien. Effectuez cette mission !
To get to the Orastery, you have to go to the port area by heading back west from this gate. Your country is counting on you!${prompt};L'Orasterie est le ministère qui gère une Académie de Mages pour améliorer les capacités magiques de l'armée.${prompt}
I, erm, I have a friend who serves at the Orastery. H-he's so cool!;Pour accéder à l'Orasterie, vous devez vous rendre dans la zone portuaire en retournant vers l'ouest depuis cette guérite. Votre pays compte sur vous !${prompt}
Gee... I wish I could be m-more like him!${prompt};J'ai, euh, un ami qui sert à l'Orasterie. I-il est tellement cool !
O-only the e-elite students from the School of Magic can go on to enter the Orastery. So, so the Tarutaru in the Orastery are the most brilliant magic users in the whole of Windurst!${prompt};M-mais je souhaite pouvoir être p-plus comme lui !${prompt}
The Horutoto Ruins are a bunch of old towerrrs out in Sarutabaruta.${prompt};Seuls les étudiants d'élite de l'École de Magie peuvent entrer à l'Orasterie. Donc, les Tarutaru à l'Orasterie sont les utilisateurs de magie les plus brillants de tout Windurst !${prompt}
But they're all falling to pieces now...;Les Ruines de Horutoto sont un ensemble de vieilles tours dans Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
It was the Tarutaru who destrrroyed them. They insist it was all due to the Great Warrr, but that just sounds like halfling half-truths to me.${prompt};Mais elles sont toutes en train de s'effondrer maintenant...
You'rrre not s'posed to go straight to them magical towers, y'know? You'rrre s'posed to go to the O～rastery first...I think.${prompt};Ce sont les Tarutaru qui les ont détruites. Ils insistent sur le fait que c'était à cause de la Grande Guerre, mais ça ressemble juste à des demi-vérités halfling pour moi.${prompt}
The Orastery is in charge of the Mage Academy, y'know? That's where the Tarutaru practice their spells all day in order to perrrfect them. It's the big building in the port area...I think.${prompt};Vous n'êtes pas censé aller directement aux tours magiques, vous savez ? Vous êtes censé aller d'abord à l'Orasterie... je pense.${prompt}
The details of the mission will be explained when you meet with the Orastery's minister. I can't say he's the most pleasant of people, but at least he has guts.${prompt};L'Orasterie est responsable de l'Académie des Mages, vous savez ? C'est là que les Tarutaru pratiquent leurs sorts toute la journée pour les perfectionner. C'est le grand bâtiment dans la zone portuaire... je pense.${prompt}
Do us proud!${prompt};Les détails de la mission seront expliqués lorsque vous rencontrerez le ministre de l'Orasterie. Je ne peux pas dire qu'il soit la personne la plus agréable, mais au moins il a du cran.${prompt}
Good job!;Faites-nous honneur !${prompt}
Glad to see you made it back alive! I trust the mission wasn't too dangerous.${prompt};Bon travail !
Allocating rrrank points according to your efforts...has enabled you to go up to rrrank two! Congratulations!${prompt};Content de voir que vous êtes revenu en vie ! J'espère que la mission n'était pas trop dangereuse.${prompt}
Did you enjoy your little run-in with the ministerrr of the Orastery? Grrr... Oh, and were you able to meet his little sisterrr?${prompt};L'allocation des points de rang selon vos efforts... vous a permis de monter au rang deux ! Félicitations !${prompt}
The Minister of the Orastery's sisterrr is named Apururu. You'd know if you met herrr. She's also the ministerrr of the Manustery.${prompt};Avez-vous apprécié votre petit tête-à-tête avec le ministre de l'Orasterie ? Grrr... Oh, et avez-vous pu rencontrer sa petite sœur ?${prompt}
Missions are all verrry well and good, but you should also try some quests too...I think!${prompt};La sœur du ministre de l'Orasterie s'appelle Apururu. Vous sauriez si vous l'aviez rencontrée. Elle est aussi la ministre de la Manasterie.${prompt}
Speaking to the townsfolk and trrrying to help them with their problems... It can be very beneficial, y'know!${prompt};Les missions sont très bien, mais vous devriez aussi essayer quelques quêtes... Je pense !${prompt}
You've come just at the rrright time. The Manustery just up the rrroad there is asking for help in making automaton guards at the Cardian workshop.${prompt};Parler aux habitants et essayer de les aider avec leurs problèmes... Cela peut être très bénéfique, vous savez !${prompt}
Seeing as the Cardian workshop is rrright next door, you can hardly turn this mission down, can you?${prompt};Vous arrivez juste au bon moment. La Manasterie juste là-bas demande de l'aide pour la fabrication de gardes automates à l'atelier de Cardians.${prompt}
Accept this mission?;Étant donné que l'atelier de Cardians est juste à côté, vous ne pouvez guère refuser cette mission, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Acceptez-vous cette mission ?
Accept.;${selection-lines}
Decline.${prompt};Accepter.
Ask the staff at the Cardian workshop for the details.${prompt};Refuser.${prompt}
The Manustery's Cardian workshop is straight back down that rrroad there, on the right-hand side of the Bomingo Round.${prompt};Demandez aux employés de l'atelier de Cardians les détails.${prompt}
Rrreally?;L'atelier de Cardians de la Manasterie est tout droit là-bas, sur le côté droit de la Bomingo Round.${prompt}
Too bad, then.${prompt};Vraiment ?
C-Cardians were invented to fight as magical puppet-like s-soldiers in the Great War of twenty-wenty years ago.${prompt};Dommage alors.${prompt}
Th-thanks to the creation of the Cardians, Tarutaru and Mithra guards have come to suffer less injuries.${prompt};L-les Cardians ont été inventés pour combattre en tant que soldats magiques de type marionnette lors de la Grande Guerre d'il y a vingt ans.${prompt}
Compared to us, Carrrdians are useless. They have no sense when it comes to fighting.${prompt};G-grâce à la création des Cardians, les gardes Tarutaru et Mithra ont moins souffert de blessures.${prompt}
However, I'll say this about them...they have no fearrr of death. Even we Mithra aren't as darrring as they are. That could be a powerrrful advantage...${prompt};Comparés à nous, les Cardians sont inutiles. Ils n'ont aucun sens lorsqu'il s'agit de combattre.${prompt}
Go right down that road therrre, and when you come out into the round, you'll see a larrrge building up on your right...I think. Well, that's the Manustery's Cardian workshop, y'know?${prompt};Cependant, je dirai ceci à leur sujet... ils n'ont pas peur de la mort. Même nous, Mithra, ne sommes pas aussi courageux qu'eux. Cela pourrait être un avantage puissant...${prompt}
To find the entrances to the building, you may have to walk around the place a bit. But it's not enough to get you lost or anything...well, at least that's what I think.${prompt};Allez tout droit dans cette rue là-bas, et quand vous arrivez à la ronde, vous verrez un grand bâtiment sur votre droite... Je pense. Eh bien, c'est l'atelier de Cardians de la Manasterie, vous savez ?${prompt}
I'm sure the Minister of the Manustery will fill you in on the details of your mission.${prompt};Pour trouver les entrées du bâtiment, vous devrez peut-être vous promener un peu. Mais ce n'est pas assez pour vous perdre ou quelque chose comme ça... enfin, c'est ce que je pense.${prompt}
Cardians come in useful when you're after quantity over quality. Anyway, carry out your mission well--at least it'll help us keep the peace with our neighborhood ministry!${prompt};Je suis sûr que le ministre de la Manasterie vous donnera les détails de votre mission.${prompt}
Hello-ello! And you are...;Les Cardians sont utiles lorsque vous recherchez la quantité plutôt que la qualité. Quoi qu'il en soit, menez bien votre mission--au moins cela nous aidera-t-il à maintenir la paix avec notre ministère voisin !${prompt}
Oh, the volunteer to help us out with my Manustery's little mission, rightaru?${prompt};Bonjour ! Et vous êtes...
Very nice of you to have come.;Oh, le volontaire pour nous aider avec la petite mission de ma Manasterie, c'est bien ça ?${prompt}
My name is Apururu. I'm the Minister of the Manustery, and head of this Cardian workshop.${prompt};Très gentil de votre part d'être venu.
But first, I should give you a rundown of what the Manustery is all about, I s'pose.${prompt};Je m'appelle Apururu. Je suis la ministre de la Manasterie, et responsable de cet atelier de Cardians.${prompt}
The Manustery is the ministry in charge of the production of automaton guards, otherwise known as Cardians. As far as military might goes, our Cardians are second only to the Orastery's War Warlocks.${prompt};Mais d'abord, je devrais vous donner un aperçu de ce qu'est la Manasterie, je suppose.${prompt}
Have you ever tried speaking to those doll-like beings that answer back in the words of the stars? Well, they are our Cardians!${prompt};La Manasterie est le ministère chargé de la production de gardes automates, également appelés Cardians. En ce qui concerne la puissance militaire, nos Cardians sont les seconds seulement aux Warlocks de guerre de l'Orasterie.${prompt}
We cast a special kind of magic on a doll made of straw, cloth, and other stuff--that's what gives life to a Cardian.${prompt};Avez-vous déjà essayé de parler à ces êtres semblables à des poupées qui répondent avec les mots des étoiles ? Eh bien, ce sont nos Cardians !${prompt}
We ask traveling merchants or adventurers to provide us with most of the materials we need to make Cardians. But there is one essential material we can't just ask anyone to provide us with...${prompt};Nous lançons un type spécial de magie sur une poupée faite de paille, de tissu et d'autres matériaux--c'est ce qui donne vie à un Cardian.${prompt}
That's the heart of the Cardian--a Mana Orb. Without a fully-charged Mana Orb, we cannot cast our special magic on the Cardian to keep them animated.${prompt};Nous demandons aux marchands ambulants ou aux aventuriers de nous fournir la plupart des matériaux dont nous avons besoin pour fabriquer des Cardians. Mais il y a un matériau essentiel que nous ne pouvons pas demander à n'importe qui de nous fournir...${prompt}
That's why we leave the job of energizing Mana Orbs with magic to adventurers from Windurst only. These spheres are very important, so they cannot be entrusted to people-weople from other lands.${prompt};C'est le cœur du Cardian--une Orbe de Mana. Sans une Orbe de Mana entièrement chargée, nous ne pouvons pas lancer notre magie spéciale sur le Cardian pour les garder animés.${prompt}
Here...take these six dark Mana Orbs that have lost their glow.${prompt};C'est pourquoi nous confions la tâche d'énergiser les Orbes de Mana avec de la magie aux aventuriers de Windurst seulement. Ces sphères sont très importantes, donc elles ne peuvent pas être confiées à des gens d'autres pays.${prompt}
You are to go to the southeastern magic tower of the Horutoto Ruins in East Sarutabaruta.${prompt};Tenez... prenez ces six Orbes de Mana sombres qui ont perdu leur lueur.${prompt}
That's the only magic tower that's still functioning well enough to energize Mana Orbs.${prompt};Vous devez vous rendre à la tour de magie du sud-est des Ruines de Horutoto dans l'Est de Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
Ask Pore-Ohre at the Horutoto Ruins to find out how to energize Mana Orbs properly-woperly.${prompt};C'est la seule tour de magie qui fonctionne encore assez bien pour énergiser les Orbes de Mana.${prompt}
You could find it to be quite a troublesome task, so if you are not quite sure of yourself, ask some of your fellow adventurers for help. Well, good luck and ta-taru!${prompt};Demandez à Pore-Ohre aux Ruines de Horutoto comment énergiser correctement les Orbes de Mana.${prompt}
Lately a lot of monsters have started to roam about under the southeastern magic tower, so make sure you're prepared for adventure.${prompt};Vous pourriez trouver cette tâche assez difficile, donc si vous n'êtes pas tout à fait sûr de vous, demandez de l'aide à quelques-uns de vos compagnons aventuriers. Eh bien, bonne chance et ta-taru !${prompt}
Once you have filled all of the Mana Orbs with magical energy, please bring them back here to me.${prompt};Dernièrement, beaucoup de monstres ont commencé à errer sous la tour de magie du sud-est, alors assurez-vous d'être prêt pour l'aventure.${prompt}
Oh, and unless you have all six of the dark Mana Orbs placed in their respective receptacles, the magical energy of the tower won't flow through them at all. Make sure you have all six in position before you flick the switch on the big magical gizmo at the back of the tower's base.${prompt};Une fois que vous avez rempli toutes les Orbes de Mana avec de l'énergie magique, veuillez les ramener ici.${prompt}
Well, take care, now.;Oh, et à moins d'avoir toutes les six Orbes de Mana sombres placées dans leurs réceptacles respectifs, l'énergie magique de la tour ne circulera pas du tout à travers elles. Assurez-vous d'avoir toutes les six en position avant d'actionner l'interrupteur sur le grand appareil magique à l'arrière de la base de la tour.${prompt}
Try not to get into too much trouble.${prompt};Eh bien, prenez soin de vous.
Ask Pore-Ohre in the southeastern magic tower of the Horutoto Ruins to find out how to energize Mana Orbs properly.${prompt};Essayez de ne pas vous attirer trop d'ennuis.${prompt}
Once you have filled all of the Mana Orbs with magical energy, please bring them back here to me. I'll be waiting for you.${prompt};Demandez à Pore-Ohre dans la tour de magie du sud-est des Ruines de Horutoto comment énergiser correctement les Orbes de Mana.${prompt}
Almost all of the Horutoto Ruins were blown to pieces twenty years ago due to the enormous magic of the heroic “Mastermind of the Millennium.”${prompt};Une fois que vous avez rempli toutes les Orbes de Mana avec de l'énergie magique, veuillez les ramener ici. Je vous attends.${prompt}
The only magic tower left barely functioning, the southeastern one, is totally unstable-wable in the amount of energy it produces.${prompt};Presque toutes les Ruines de Horutoto ont été soufflées en morceaux il y a vingt ans en raison de l'énorme magie du héroïque “Maître du Millénaire”.${prompt}
So it's nigh on impossible to create quality Mana Orbs, which leaves us weakened dramatically.${prompt};La seule tour de magie qui reste à peine fonctionnelle, celle du sud-est, est totalement instable dans la quantité d'énergie qu'elle produit.${prompt}
Mana Orbs are the hearts of Cardians, you know? If a Cardian were to lose its Mana Orb, it would return to being just an inanimate straw dolly-wolly.${prompt};Il est donc presque impossible de créer des Orbes de Mana de qualité, ce qui nous affaiblit considérablement.${prompt}
And, if the magical energy in the Mana Orb ever runs out, even if you were to re-energize it with the gizmos in the magic towers, they still forget everything that they remembered up to then.${prompt};Les Orbes de Mana sont les cœurs des Cardians, vous savez ? Si un Cardian venait à perdre son Orbe de Mana, il redeviendrait juste une poupée de paille inanimée.${prompt}
Either way, this is what's considered as “death” for Cardians.${prompt};Et, si l'énergie magique dans l'Orbe de Mana venait à s'épuiser, même si vous deviez la ré-énergiser avec les gadgets dans les tours de magie, ils oublieraient tout ce qu'ils avaient mémorisé jusqu'à présent.${prompt}
The reason that the life span of Cardians has become shortenedy is that the quality of the Mana Orbs has worsenedy.${prompt};De toute façon, c'est ce qui est considéré comme “la mort” pour les Cardians.${prompt}
Just when the monsters are growing strongery and we need more Cardians than ever before, too... I'd hate to think what lies aheady if things go on like this...${prompt};La raison pour laquelle la durée de vie des Cardians s'est raccourcie est que la qualité des Orbes de Mana s'est détériorée.${prompt}
What?;Juste au moment où les monstres deviennent plus forts et où nous avons besoin de plus de Cardians que jamais auparavant, aussi... J'aurais horreur de penser à ce qui nous attend si les choses continuent ainsi...${prompt}
Some feral Cardians turned up againy-wainy?${prompt};Quoi ?
It's quite an embarrassing tale for us at the Manustery, but some of the old Cardians from the war years escaped and went wild...${prompt};Des Cardians sauvages sont réapparus ?${prompt}
Those old Cardians carry out such wickedness as stealing Mana Orbs and attacking people.${prompt};C'est une histoire assez gênante pour nous à la Manustery, mais certains des anciens Cardians de l'époque de la guerre se sont échappés et sont devenus sauvages...${prompt}
Mana Orbs are their hearts, remember? So the reason they steal the Mana Orbs is to revive their friends who have run out of magic in their Mana Orbs.${prompt};Ces anciens Cardians commettent des méfaits tels que le vol d'Orbes de Mana et l'attaque de personnes.${prompt}
But Mana Orbs are just spheres of magic. Unless there is a mage who can use the Mana Orb and breathe life into the Cardians, they are totally useless.${prompt};Les Orbes de Mana sont leur cœur, vous vous en souvenez ? Donc la raison pour laquelle ils volent les Orbes de Mana est de ressusciter leurs amis qui ont épuisé leur magie dans leurs Orbes de Mana.${prompt}
So even if they are successful in stealing the Mana Orbs, it serves them no purpose...${prompt};Mais les Orbes de Mana ne sont que des sphères de magie. À moins qu'il n'y ait un mage capable d'utiliser l'Orbe de Mana et de donner vie aux Cardians, ils sont totalement inutiles.${prompt}
But I'm glad that you and poor Pore-Ohre are safe. That's the most important thing.${prompt};Donc même s'ils réussissent à voler les Orbes de Mana, cela ne leur sert à rien...${prompt}
Well, anyway, thank you for all your trouble and hard efforts. Until next time, then, ta-taru...!${prompt};Mais je suis heureux que vous et le pauvre Pore-Ohre soyez en sécurité. C'est le plus important.${prompt}
I hear that the Cardians who have escaped from our care have been gathering underground in the Horutoto Ruins and plotting bad deeds.${prompt};Eh bien, quoi qu'il en soit, merci pour tous vos efforts et votre travail acharné. À la prochaine fois, alors, ta-taru...!${prompt}
If we leave them aloney-woney, the magic energy in their Mana Orb hearts will run out, and they will return to being nothing more than straw dolls.${prompt};J'entends dire que les Cardians qui se sont échappés de notre surveillance se rassemblent sous terre dans les Ruines de Horutoto et complotent de mauvaises actions.${prompt}
But someday I'll have to do something about the problem... Someday...${prompt};Si nous les laissons tranquilles, l'énergie magique dans leurs cœurs d'Orbes de Mana s'épuisera, et ils redeviendront rien de plus que des poupées de paille.${prompt}
Thank you very muchy-wuchy!♪;Mais un jour, je devrai faire quelque chose à propos du problème... Un jour...${prompt}
Looks like you have re-energized all of our Mana Orbs. What a great help you were!♪${prompt};Merci beaucoup !♪
But I'm glad nothing disastrously bad happened... Lately some of the people who have volunteered for this mission have been attacked by feral Cardians at the exit of the Horutoto Ruins!${prompt};On dirait que vous avez ré-énergisé toutes nos Orbes de Mana. Quelle grande aide vous avez été !♪${prompt}
When you go about breathing life into the inanimate, who knows what will happen? We're just asking for trouble.${prompt};Mais je suis content qu'il ne se soit rien passé de désastreusement mauvais... Récemment, certains des volontaires pour cette mission ont été attaqués par des Cardians sauvages à la sortie des Ruines de Horutoto !${prompt}
But that's just a risk we Manustery employees have to take! It's just that...I wish they paid us a little more as hazard pay.${prompt};Quand on donne vie à l'inanimé, qui sait ce qui peut arriver ? On demande juste des ennuis.${prompt}
The previous minister was a terrible man. When the war ended, he started throwing away our Cardians left, right and center.${prompt};Mais c'est juste un risque que nous, employés de la Manusterie, devons prendre ! C'est juste que... J'aimerais bien qu'ils nous paient un peu plus pour les risques.${prompt}
Of course the Cardians are going to run away. And of course they are going to come back and kidnap the previous minister. He should have seen it coming!${prompt};L'ancien ministre était un homme terrible. Quand la guerre a pris fin, il a commencé à jeter nos Cardians à droite et à gauche.${prompt}
It's said that underneath the southwesterny tower of the Horutoto Ruins is the graveyardy where the souls of the thrown away Cardians lingery.${prompt};Bien sûr que les Cardians allaient s'enfuir. Et bien sûr qu'ils allaient revenir et enlever l'ancien ministre. Il aurait dû le voir venir !${prompt}
Minister Apururu once saidy that saving the souls of such automatonys is the responsibility of the Manustery.${prompt};On dit que sous la tour sud-ouest des Ruines de Horutoto se trouve le cimetière où errent les âmes des Cardians jetés.${prompt}
So, have these missions helped in making you stronger? Perhaps you're about rrready for a mission that involves the Yagudo beastmen.${prompt};Le ministre Apururu a déjà dit que sauver les âmes de ces automates est la responsabilité de la Manusterie.${prompt}
On the other side of West Sarutabaruta is a place called Giddeus--the home of the Yagudo.${prompt};Alors, est-ce que ces missions vous ont aidé à devenir plus fort ? Peut-être êtes-vous prêt pour une mission qui implique les Yagudo beastmen.${prompt}
You know the Yagudo, don't you? They are the beastmen who for ever so long have rrravaged the grasslands of Sarutabaruta.${prompt};De l'autre côté de l'Ouest de Sarutabaruta se trouve un endroit appelé Giddeus--le foyer des Yagudo.${prompt}
But the current Star Sibyl took it upon herself to try and make amicable rrrelations with the damned enemy...${prompt};Vous connaissez les Yagudo, n'est-ce pas ? Ce sont les beastmen qui ont ravagé les prairies de Sarutabaruta depuis si longtemps.${prompt}
As a rrresult, we have to pay tribute to the Yagudo with food offerings as a sign of our friendship. That's the crux of this mission.${prompt};Mais l'actuelle Star Sibyl s'est donné pour mission de tenter de créer des relations amicales avec l'ennemi maudit...${prompt}
First, you are to go to the Rrrhinostery's biological laboratory in Windurst Waters. The rrresearchers there will provide you with today's food offering for the Yagudo.${prompt};En conséquence, nous devons rendre hommage aux Yagudo avec des offrandes de nourriture en signe d'amitié. C'est là tout le cœur de cette mission.${prompt}
The rrresearchers will tell you what you are to do next.${prompt};Tout d'abord, vous devez vous rendre au laboratoire biologique de la Rrrhinosterie aux Eaux de Windurst. Les chercheurs là-bas vous fourniront l'offrande alimentaire d'aujourd'hui pour les Yagudo.${prompt}
This is an important mission issued by Heavens Tower, or more specifically, the Star Sibyl herself. Control your hatred of the beastmen and fulfill this mission as best as you can!${prompt};Les chercheurs vous diront ce que vous devez faire ensuite.${prompt}
Grrr... Dammit!;Cette mission est importante et a été émise par la Tour des Cieux, ou plus précisément, la Star Sibyl elle-même. Contrôlez votre haine envers les hommes bêtes et remplissez cette mission du mieux que vous pouvez !${prompt}
How long do we have to go on paying tribute to scavengers who could double-cross us at any time?${prompt};Grrr... Mince alors !
Anyway, you had better head on over to the Rrrhinostery in Windurst Waters, and pick up the food offering that the rrresearchers there have prepared for you to offer at Giddeus.${prompt};Combien de temps devons-nous continuer à rendre hommage à des charognards qui pourraient nous trahir à tout moment ?${prompt}
I, I understand totally-wotally what the Star Sibyl is saying...${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit, vous feriez mieux de vous rendre à la Rrrhinostery dans les eaux de Windurst, et de récupérer l'offrande alimentaire que les chercheurs là-bas ont préparée pour vous offrir à Giddeus.${prompt}
The Star Sibyl is thinking first and foremost of the safety of us Windurstians.${prompt};Je, je comprends parfaitement ce que dit la Star Sibylle...${prompt}
I just don't underrrstand why the Tarutaru fear those Yagudo.${prompt};La Star Sibylle pense avant tout à la sécurité de nous, les Windurstiens.${prompt}
Like, wasn't it because of that old Shadow Lorrrd that they nearly lost the war twenty years ago?${prompt};Je ne comprends juste pas pourquoi les Tarutaru craignent ces Yagudo.${prompt}
With him dead and burrried, even if we were to have an all-out war with the Yagudo, we'd still come out on top...I think.${prompt};Comme, n'était-ce pas à cause de ce vieux Seigneur des Ombres qu'ils ont presque perdu la guerre il y a vingt ans ?${prompt}
It's not like we're mindlessly opposed to a frrriendship pact with the Yagudo.${prompt};Avec lui mort et enterré, même si nous devions avoir une guerre totale avec les Yagudo, nous sortirions quand même gagnants... je pense.${prompt}
Those Yagudo don't keep their side of the barrrgain. We have the old saying of “never share a meal with those who do not keep their prrromises.”${prompt};Ce n'est pas comme si nous étions opposés de manière irréfléchie à un pacte d'amitié avec les Yagudo.${prompt}
So you completed the mission...?;"Ces Yagudo ne tiennent pas leur part du marché. Nous avons le vieux dicton : ""ne partage jamais un repas avec ceux qui ne tiennent pas leurs promesses.""${prompt}"
Then I shall be rrrecommending you for promotion to rrrank two.${prompt};Donc vous avez accompli la mission... ?
I suggest you try your hand at conquests now, as you'll need to gain more rrrank points before we can issue you further missions.${prompt};Alors je vous recommanderai pour une promotion au rang deux.${prompt}
You can gain the rrrank points you need from participating in the rrregional conquests. Ask the War Warlock guard in charge of conquests over there for further information...${prompt};Je vous suggère d'essayer votre chance dans les conquêtes maintenant, car vous aurez besoin de gagner plus de points de rang avant que nous puissions vous confier d'autres missions.${prompt}
See you around.${prompt};Vous pouvez obtenir les points de rang dont vous avez besoin en participant aux conquêtes régionales. Demandez au garde War Warlock responsable des conquêtes là-bas pour plus d'informations...${prompt}
Grrr... You went ahead and fulfilled that mission, huh? That means we gave the lazy Yagudo nourrrishment to make them stronger...I think.${prompt};À la prochaine.${prompt}
Captain Rakoh Buuma also disagrrrees with the Star Sibyl on this, y'know? We should just rrrefuse to hand out this mission from now on...I think.${prompt};Grrr... Vous avez accompli cette mission, hein ? Cela signifie que nous avons donné aux Yagudo paresseux de la nourriture pour les rendre plus forts... je pense.${prompt}
W-well done!;Le capitaine Rakoh Buuma est également en désaccord avec la Star Sibylle à ce sujet, vous savez ? Nous devrions simplement refuser de donner cette mission à partir de maintenant... je pense.${prompt}
I knew you could do it. I, I hope you didn't get hurty-wurty.${prompt};B-bien joué !
If only those Yagudo would let down their guardy-wuardy a bit, we wouldn't have to go through all that just to give them their offerings.${prompt};Je savais que vous en étiez capable. J'espère que vous ne vous êtes pas fait mal.${prompt}
Even though you got promoted to rank two, you're still an underrrling. But don't be disappointed...${prompt};Si seulement ces Yagudo baissaient un peu leur garde, nous n'aurions pas à passer par tout ça juste pour leur donner leurs offrandes.${prompt}
Underlings can get out of work without otherrr people complaining much. And you can also secretly eat some snacks too, if you're carrreful.${prompt};Même si vous avez été promu au rang deux, vous êtes toujours un débutant. Mais ne soyez pas déçu...${prompt}
Have you ever been to the Optistery's Library of Magic in Windurst Waters?${prompt};Les débutants peuvent esquiver le travail sans que les autres ne se plaignent beaucoup. Et vous pouvez aussi manger quelques snacks en secret, si vous êtes prudent.${prompt}
Looks like they're in a spot of trouble there, as they are urgently asking for any able adventurer we have on hand to go help them out.${prompt};Avez-vous déjà été à la Bibliothèque de Magie de l'Optisterie dans les eaux de Windurst ?${prompt}
How about it, then?;Il semble qu'ils soient dans une mauvaise passe là-bas, car ils demandent de toute urgence à tout aventurier capable que nous avons sous la main de venir les aider.${prompt}
If you feel you're up to it, why don't you volunteer to help the Optistery out?${prompt};Qu'en pensez-vous, alors ?
Accept Mission?;Si vous vous sentez prêt, pourquoi ne pas vous porter volontaire pour aider l'Optistery ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Accepter la mission ?
Accept.;${selection-lines}
Decline.${prompt};Accepter.
Then proceed to the Optistery's Library of Magic immediately. It's on the north side of Windurst Waters--the building that the rrroad to the north gatehouse rrruns through.${prompt};Refuser.${prompt}
The Library of Magic is northwest of here in Windurst Waters--the area furthest away from Windurst Woods.${prompt};Ensuite, rendez-vous immédiatement à la Bibliothèque de Magie de l'Optistery. C'est du côté nord des eaux de Windurst, le bâtiment par lequel passe la route vers la guérite nord.${prompt}
The library lends out books if you're interested in them... Not that I've ever been there myself.${prompt};La Bibliothèque de Magie est au nord-ouest d'ici dans les eaux de Windurst, la zone la plus éloignée des Bois de Windurst.${prompt}
I hear they have a problem with people taking out books and never rrreturning them. Grrr... Those Tarutaru are such easy game!${prompt};La bibliothèque prête des livres si vous êtes intéressé... Pas que j'y sois jamais allé moi-même.${prompt}
Th-the Library of Magic isn't magic in name only. Almost all the books there have some sort of enchantment-bechantment cast upon them.${prompt};J'ai entendu dire qu'ils avaient un problème avec les gens qui empruntent des livres et ne les rendent jamais. Grrr... Ces Tarutaru sont une proie facile !${prompt}
W-when you check a book out, the librarians temporarily remove the magic for safety's sake. But, but, sometimes they've been known to forget, so be careful!${prompt};La Bibliothèque de Magie n'est pas magique que de nom. Presque tous les livres là-bas ont quelque sorte d'enchantement.${prompt}
I've borrowed books from the Librarrry of Magic too, you know.${prompt};Quand vous empruntez un livre, les bibliothécaires retirent temporairement la magie par mesure de sécurité. Mais parfois, ils oublient, alors faites attention !${prompt}
One time I took a book home to read, and as soon as I opened it a whole army of frrrogs came jumping out at me!${prompt};J'ai aussi emprunté des livres à la Bibliothèque de Magie, vous savez.${prompt}
I borrowed as many books as I could following that, but never had a single frog pop out at me. Too bad, as they were really tasty frrrogs, too!${prompt};Une fois, j'ai emporté un livre chez moi pour le lire, et dès que je l'ai ouvert, une armée de grenouilles en est sortie en sautant !${prompt}
You'rrre going to the library, huh? That reminds me...I have a book overdue there...I think.${prompt};J'ai emprunté autant de livres que possible par la suite, mais aucune grenouille ne m'est jamais sortie. Dommage, car elles étaient vraiment savoureuses !${prompt}
What? You want to know what book I borrrrowed? Well, I'm not telling, so there!${prompt};Vous allez à la bibliothèque, hein ? Ça me retourle... J'ai un livre en retard là-bas... je crois.${prompt}
(Don't ask me what book I took out. It's not like I actually read them... They'rrre way over my reading age.)${prompt};Quoi ? Vous voulez savoir quel livre j'ai emprunté ? Eh bien, je ne le dirai pas, na !${prompt}
You want to know if I have a “restrrricted book” in my possession, do you?${prompt};(Ne me demandez pas quel livre j'ai emprunté. Ce n'est pas comme si je les lisais vraiment... Ils sont bien au-dessus de mon âge de lecture.)${prompt}
Where in Vana'diel did you hearrr that? You can never be too carrreful, you know.${prompt};"Vous voulez savoir si j'ai un ""livre restreint"" en ma possession, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}"
Okay, I'll let you in on it.;Où dans Vana'diel avez-vous entendu ça ? On ne peut jamais être trop prudent, vous savez.${prompt}
You're a second rank adventurer, arrren't you? Then allow me to ask you this little favor I have firrrst...${prompt};D'accord, je vais vous le dire.
If you scratch my back, I'll scrrratch yours...so to speak. Do what I ask and I'll let you check the book I found. How about it, then?${prompt};Vous êtes un aventurier de deuxième rang, n'est-ce pas ? Alors permettez-moi de vous demander ce petit service que j'ai d'abord...${prompt}
Hear her favor?;Si vous me rendez service, je ferai de même... pour ainsi dire. Faites ce que je demande et je vous laisserai consulter le livre que j'ai trouvé. Qu'en dites-vous ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Écouter sa faveur ?
Listen.;${selection-lines}
Refuse.${prompt};Écouter.
If that's how it is, then farrrewell, sucker.${prompt};Refuser.${prompt}
Did you know that up in the Tahrongi Canyon, there is a serrries of caves known as the Maze of Shakhrami?${prompt};Si c'est comme ça, alors adieu, pigeon.${prompt}
Happy hunting!${prompt};Saviez-vous qu'il y a dans le canyon de Tahrongi une série de grottes connues sous le nom de Labyrinthe de Shakhrami ?${prompt}
In the Tahrongi Canyon, there is a serrries of caves called the Maze of Shakhrami.${prompt};Bonne chasse !${prompt}
No coral, no deal!${prompt};Dans le canyon de Tahrongi, il y a une série de grottes appelées le Labyrinthe de Shakhrami.${prompt}
You also want that book we found, don't you? Then you'll be needing something to trade the top cat with!${prompt};Pas de corail, pas d'affaire !${prompt}
Heh-heh-heh...;Vous voulez aussi ce livre que nous avons trouvé, n'est-ce pas ? Alors vous aurez besoin de quelque chose à échanger avec le gros bonnet !${prompt}
We don't deal in cold, hard gil, you know? We much preferrr small and pretty valuables...${prompt};Heh-heh-heh...
Hah! If you want the book we found, then you'rrre in for some major wheeling and dealing with the top cat, arrren't you, now?${prompt};Nous ne traitons pas en gils froids et durs, vous savez ? Nous préférons de petites et jolies valeurs...${prompt}
Why's that, you say?;Hah ! Si vous voulez le livre que nous avons trouvé, alors vous êtes en plein dans une grosse affaire avec le gros bonnet, n'est-ce pas, maintenant ?${prompt}
Well, even that greedy, rich merrrchant from Windurst Waters is... Oops!${prompt};Pourquoi cela, demandez-vous ?
Ignore what I just said.;Eh bien, même ce marchand riche et avare des eaux de Windurst... Oups !${prompt}
I'll make lute strings out of your guts if you tell anyone what I just let slip!${prompt};Ignorez ce que je viens de dire.
So, you came thrrrough with it?;Je ferai des cordes de luth avec vos tripes si vous dites à quelqu'un ce que je viens de laisser échapper !${prompt}
Here, I'll give you this key. We'll make the trrransaction at my hideout, deep in the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt};Alors, vous avez réussi ?
You go on ahead.;Tenez, je vous donnerai cette clé. Nous ferons la transaction dans ma cachette, au fond des Ruines d'Horutoto.${prompt}
I'll catch up with you therrre once I've finished up herrre!${prompt};Vous pouvez y aller.
We'll carry out our little trrransaction at my hideout, deep in the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt};Je vous rejoindrai là-bas une fois que j'aurai terminé ici !${prompt}
You go ahead.;Nous effectuerons notre petite transaction dans ma cachette, au fond des Ruines d'Horutoto.${prompt}
I'll catch up with you therrre!${prompt};Vous y allez.
I'm surprrrised you were able to find what we wanted. Now I can harrrdly wait to join the top cat in making the deal with you. Heh-heh-heh...${prompt};Je vous rejoindrai là-bas !${prompt}
You should alrrready know this, but don't you dare tell anyone about the little deal we'll be making. You'll have a cat in hell's chance of living if you spill the beans on us.${prompt};Je suis surpris que vous ayez pu trouver ce que nous voulions. Maintenant, je suis impatient de me joindre au gros bonnet pour conclure l'affaire avec vous. Heh-heh-heh...${prompt}
I can't stand the sight of you. Get out of herrre, and don't show yourrr face to me any time soon.${prompt};Vous devriez déjà le savoir, mais ne vous avisez pas de dire à qui que ce soit ce petit marché que nous allons conclure. Vous n'aurez aucune chance de survivre si vous crachez le morceau sur nous.${prompt}
Some Carrrdians were carrying several larrrge boxes out of the Priming Gate in Windurst Walls.${prompt};Je ne supporte pas votre vue. Sortez d'ici et ne me montrez pas votre visage de sitôt.${prompt}
It was fun pulling a swift one on them, but it wasn't worrrth the trouble. Don't you darrre say crime doesn't pay!${prompt};Certains Cardians transportaient plusieurs grosses boîtes hors de la Porte Principale dans les murs de Windurst.${prompt}
I meowed her once, I meowed her a thousand times. We should stop putting our paws on anything that smells of Carrrdians.${prompt};C'était amusant de leur jouer un mauvais tour, mais ça ne valait pas la peine. Ne dites pas que le crime ne paie pas !${prompt}
I neverrr want to go through that sorrrt of thing again!${prompt};Je lui ai miaulé une fois, je lui ai miaulé mille fois. Nous devrions arrêter de mettre nos pattes sur tout ce qui sent les Cardians.${prompt}
You came at just the rrright time.;Je ne veux plus jamais vivre ça !${prompt}
We just rrreceived a rrrequest for help in a large-scale mission from Heavens Tower, but we're short of adventurers to dispatch just now.${prompt};Vous êtes arrivé au bon moment.
The secretary of Heavens Tower will explain what this mission entails. Proceed there immediately.${prompt};Nous venons de recevoir une demande d'aide pour une mission de grande envergure de la part de Heavens Tower, mais nous manquons d'aventuriers à envoyer pour le moment.${prompt}
Heavens Tower is north of here in Windurst Walls. You should have the details explained to you by the secretary there.${prompt};La secrétaire de la Tour des Cieux vous expliquera en quoi consiste cette mission. Rendez-vous immédiatement là-bas.${prompt}
Gee... I, I wish I could join in this mission-wission too!${prompt};La Tour des Cieux est au nord d'ici, dans les murs de Windurst. La secrétaire là-bas devrait vous expliquer les détails.${prompt}
B-but I'm too scared to ask Sola Jaab, in, in case she literally b-bites my heady-weady off!${prompt};Gee... J'aurais aimé pouvoir participer à cette mission moi aussi !${prompt}
Once you accept this mission, you won't be coming back here any time soon, y'know.;M-mais j'ai trop peur de demander à Sola Jaab, au, au cas où elle me croquerait littéralement la têtey-wettey !${prompt}
And just when I was almost getting to like you...I think.${prompt};Une fois que vous acceptez cette mission, vous ne reviendrez pas ici de sitôt, vous savez.
Once you go to another countrrry, you'll realize just how good old Windurst is.${prompt};Et juste quand je commençais presque à vous apprécier... je crois.${prompt}
The food is great, you can cat nap as much as you like, and turning up late is the norrrm. Everyone takes life easy herrre.${prompt};Une fois que vous irez dans un autre pays, vous réaliserez à quel point l'ancienne Windurst est agréable.${prompt}
Ah, ${name-player}!;La nourriture est excellente, vous pouvez faire des siestes à volonté, et arriver en retard est la norme. Tout le monde prend la vie facilement ici.${prompt}
Heavens Tower is hailing you!${prompt};Ah, ${name-player} !
Why, the head Sibyl Guard herself, Semih Lafihna, came asking for you! Seems your activities in all three nations have become your ticket to move up in the world, eh?${prompt};Tour des Cieux vous hèle !${prompt}
Anyway, you should hurry on over to Heavens Tower. She's as strict on herself as she is on others!${prompt};Eh bien, la garde Sibylle en chef elle-même, Semih Lafihna, est venue vous demander ! Il semble que vos activités dans les trois nations vous ont permis de monter en grade, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Semih Lafihna, eh?;Quoi qu'il en soit, vous devriez vous dépêcher d'aller à la Tour des Cieux. Elle est aussi stricte envers elle-même qu'envers les autres !${prompt}
I don't know why, but I'm just not fond of that girl.${prompt};Semih Lafihna, hein ?
Anyway, get a move on to Heavens Tower. She's strict on herself and on others!${prompt};Je ne sais pas pourquoi, mais je n'aime pas cette fille.${prompt}
Oh, so look who gets to meet Semih Lafihna...${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit, dépêchez-vous d'aller à la Tour des Cieux. Elle est stricte envers elle-même et envers les autres !${prompt}
Everyone always arrrgues over who's the better archer, Captain Rakoh Buuma or Semih Lafihna, y'know. But Captain Buuma is the best, of courrrse...well, at least that's what I think.${prompt};Oh, alors voilà qui va rencontrer Semih Lafihna...${prompt}
Sibyl Guards aren't loved by the Mithra as a whole verrry much. We don't like people who take on fancy titles and think they're betterrr than the rest of the tribe.${prompt};Tout le monde se dispute toujours pour savoir qui est le meilleur archer, le capitaine Rakoh Buuma ou Semih Lafihna, vous savez. Mais le capitaine Buuma est le meilleur, bien sûr... enfin, c'est ce que je pense.${prompt}
What's more, that Semih Lafihna is so serrrious and hard worrrking, her tail is so slim and shiny, and she's also such a know-it-all. Doesn't she just make you jealous?${prompt};Les gardes Sibylles ne sont pas très aimées par la plupart des Mithra. Nous n'aimons pas les gens qui prennent des titres pompeux et qui pensent être meilleurs que le reste de la tribu.${prompt}
S-Sibyl G-Guards are the Mithra fighter-mighters who, who serve and protect the great Star Sibyl.${prompt};De plus, cette Semih Lafihna est tellement sérieuse et travailleuse, sa queue est si mince et brillante, et elle sait tout sur tout. Ça ne vous rend pas juste jaloux ?${prompt}
M-most of the M-Mithra in Windurst serve their tribal chieftainness. So you see...Sibyl Guards are special-wecial, even in the Mithran society.${prompt};L-les gardes S-Sibylles sont les combattantes mithra qui, qui servent et protègent la grande Star Sibyl.${prompt}
This mission has been issued by the head lady-in-waiting of Heavens Tower, Zubaba.${prompt};L-la plupart des M-Mithra à Windurst servent leur cheffe tribale. Vous voyez... les gardes Sibylles sont spéciales-speciales, même dans la société mithra.${prompt}
Not that I know much about her myself, but Zubaba has been serving as head lady-in-waiting since the current Star Sibyl was a child...${prompt};Cette mission a été émise par la dame d'attente en chef de Tour des Cieux, Zubaba.${prompt}
She's not a character you dare keep waiting. I rrrecommend you hurry on over to Heavens Tower. If you fulfill a mission from the head lady-in-waiting well enough, it's bound to improve your rrreputation.${prompt};Bien que je ne sache pas grand-chose sur elle moi-même, Zubaba sert en tant que dame d'attente en chef depuis que la Star Sibylle actuelle est enfant...${prompt}
This mission has been issued by the head lady-in-waiting, Zubaba.${prompt};Ce n'est pas un personnage que vous osez faire attendre. Je vous recommande de vous dépêcher d'aller à la Tour des Cieux. Si vous remplissez bien une mission de la dame d'attente en chef, votre réputation est certainement améliorée.${prompt}

If you complete this mission well, it's bound to improve your rrreputation. Do a good job, you hear?${prompt};La dame d'attente en chef, Zubaba, vous attend à Tour des Cieux. Veuillez vous y rendre immédiatement !${prompt}
Tarutaru girls all want to become ladies-in-waiting, y'know? Like, what's wrrrong with them?${prompt};Si vous accomplissez bien cette mission, cela améliorera certainement votre réputation. Faites du bon travail, vous entendez ?${prompt}
Perrrhaps it's similar to how little Mithra girls go through a stage where they all want to grow up to become Huntresses of the Sun...I think.${prompt};Les filles tarutaru veulent toutes devenir dames d'attente, vous savez ? Comme quoi, qu'est-ce qui ne va pas avec elles ?${prompt}
I hear there are many ladies-in-waiting who serve the Star Sibyl on the second floorrr of Heavens Tower.${prompt};P-peut-être que c'est similaire au fait que les petites filles mithra passent par une phase où elles veulent toutes devenir Chasseresses du Soleil... je pense.${prompt}
Sounds as though they do all the cleaning, washing and cooking there. Grrr...${prompt};J'entends dire qu'il y a beaucoup de dames d'attente qui servent la Star Sibylle au deuxième étage de la Tour des Cieux.${prompt}

We have a formal writ of summons from Heavens Tower for you. One with a special star emblem on it signifies it is officially a mission of the utmost importance.${prompt};Gee...${prompt}

Celle-ci, avec un emblème spécial en forme d'étoile, signifie qu'il s'agit officiellement d'une mission de la plus haute importance.${prompt}
For a formal writ of summons to be issued from Heavens Tower means an extremely important announcement will be made.${prompt};Il est mentionné que vous, ${name-player}, devez “vous rendre au Planétarium de la Tour des Cieux avec une hâte précipitée”. C'est censé être le plus grand honneur qu'un citoyen de Windurst puisse avoir.${prompt}
This also means you are no longer just a simple adventurer, my friend. Keep your wits about you! We'd like to escort you to your meeting, but alas, we are unable to rrright now.${prompt};Qu'une convocation formelle soit émise de la Tour des Cieux signifie qu'une annonce extrêmement importante sera faite.${prompt}

What's this starrr emblem thingo?;Que se passe-t-il ?
I don't underrrstand...I think.${prompt};C'est quoi ce truc avec l'emblème étoilé ?
Miiri-Wohri's been carrying on all excitedly there by himself, y'know? I don't get it at all!${prompt};Je ne comprends pas...je crois.${prompt}
I don't see how anyone can get so excited about a piece of paper. Paperrr's something that even goats eat.;Miiri-Wohri s'excite tout seul là-bas, tu sais ? Je ne comprends rien du tout !${prompt}
Totally worrrthless!${prompt};Je ne vois pas comment on peut être aussi excité par un morceau de papier. Le papier, c'est quelque chose que même les chèvres mangent.
...Actually, I'm only saying that 'cause I'm jealous. I wish I got one of them wrrrits too! That's so cool!;Totalement sans valeur !${prompt}
You're so lucky!${prompt};...En fait, je dis ça juste parce que je suis jaloux. J'aimerais tellement en avoir un aussi ! C'est trop cool !
I-It's the first time I saw the real thing! I was the one who took the delivery of your writ...so I was able to touch it!${prompt};Tu as tellement de chance !${prompt}
Wow! It's, it's, it's like I touched the hand of the Star Sibyl...only indirectly! Woooo! I'm sooo happy to be alivey-wivey!${prompt};C'est la première fois que je vois la chose en vrai ! C'est moi qui ai réceptionné la livraison de ton document...alors j'ai pu le toucher !${prompt}
You haven't heard?;Wow ! C'est, c'est, c'est comme si j'avais touché la main de la Grande Prêtresse... seulement indirectement ! Wooouuuh ! Je suis tellement heureux d'être en vie !${prompt}

Seems like something bad happened in the central towerrr of the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt};C'est une situation d'urgence, donc les capitaines de chacune des quatre garnisons ont été convoqués. On dirait qu'ils ont eu une réunion secrète ou quelque chose comme ça...je crois.${prompt}
Semih Lafihna, the Sibyl Guard, had a black look on herrr face as she ran by here en route to the Horutoto Ruins. Then she came back a little while ago looking even angrierrr!${prompt};Il semble que quelque chose de grave soit arrivé dans la tour centrale des Ruines de Horutoto.${prompt}

I, I just hope nothing has happened to our blessed-wessed Star Sibyl!${prompt};Semih Lafihna, la garde de la Grande Prêtresse, avait un air sombre sur le visage en courant par ici en route vers les Ruines de Horutoto. Puis elle est revenue un peu plus tard avec un air encore plus en colère !${prompt}
If, if anything were to happen to her, Windurst would be ruined! It's b-beyond the depths of despairy-wairy!${prompt};Mon Dieu ! Windurst est en état d'urgence... J'espère juste qu'il n'est rien arrivé à notre chère Grande Prêtresse !${prompt}
This is a fearful matterrr!;Si, si quelque chose devait lui arriver, Windurst serait ruinée ! Ce serait au-delà du désespoir !${prompt}
The wind is in turrrmoil.;C'est une affaire terrifiante !
This porrrtends that something forrrmidable has occurred!${prompt};Le vent est en tourmente.
In times like these you should not lend yourrr earrr to the buzz of people. Instead, you should train your spirit to listen to the grrreater voice around you...${prompt};Cela présage que quelque chose de formidable s'est produit !${prompt}
......;En des temps comme ceux-ci, tu ne devrais pas prêter l'oreille aux rumeurs des gens. Au lieu de cela, tu devrais entraîner ton esprit à écouter la voix plus grande autour de toi...${prompt}
I sense something peculiar is going on. Something as big as naturrre, yet totally contrary to it, has descended upon these lands...${prompt};......
An emergency mission addressed to you has been issued once again from Heavens Tower.${prompt};I sense something peculiar is going on. Something as big as naturrre, yet totally contrary to it, has descended upon these lands...${prompt}
You had better hurry to Heavens Tower and rrreceive your exact orders there. Seems as though you shall be traveling to the ends of Vana'diel.${prompt};An emergency mission addressed to you has been issued once again from Tour des Cieux.${prompt}

What does our trrribal leader think of all this...I wonder?${prompt};The ancient rrruins of Fei'Yin...? I thought it was just the stuff of fairy tales...${prompt}

I hope Tour des Cieux didn't give our tribal leader the cold shoulder. I'd never forrrgive them for that!${prompt}

It's prrractically impossible to gather the ministers of the five ministries together, so they usually announce these things months in advance...I think.${prompt};It's extrrremely rare for the five ministries to suddenly hold a meeting, y'know?${prompt}

“The All-New C-2000”!${prompt};Ta～da～!!!

Stick with me, kid--with my brains and your brawn, we're bound to go places together!${prompt};Reste avec moi, gamin--avec mon intelligence et ta force, nous allons sûrement aller loin ensemble !${prompt}
You see...I just happened to be in the process of teaching “The All-New C-2000” the scents of different “enemies.” “The All-New C-2000” has a better nose than us people do, you knows?${prompt};Vous voyez... J'étais justement en train d'enseigner à “Le Tout-Nouveau C-2000” les odeurs des différents “ennemis”. “Le Tout-Nouveau C-2000” a un meilleur nez que nous autres, vous savez ?${prompt}
For starters, I was hoping you could bring me some of the items that the monsters in Sarutabaruta drop.${prompt};Pour commencer, j'espérais que tu pourrais me rapporter certains des objets que les monstres de Sarutabaruta laissent tomber.${prompt}

Don't forget, now...;N'oublie pas, maintenant...
So hurry, hur～ry!;Alors dépêche-toi, dépê～che-toi !
You don't want someone else to beat you to it, and have their name go down in history instead of yours, do you?${prompt};Tu ne veux pas que quelqu'un d'autre te devance et que son nom soit inscrit dans l'histoire à ta place, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Cardians aren't people, you know-whow? They are like dolls made out of all sorts of materials. We place the magic on those dolls that breathes life into them.${prompt};Les Cardians ne sont pas des gens, tu sais-whow ? Ce sont comme des poupées faites de toutes sortes de matériaux.

Minister Apururu is too soft on him. The future of our Manustery is bleak indeed!${prompt};Ministre Apururu est trop indulgente envers lui. L'avenir de notre Manustery est vraiment sombre !${prompt}
Mister Kopuro-Popuro mixes and matches the magicky he casts on Cardians in order to animatey them.${prompt};Monsieur Kopuro-Popuro mélange et assortit les sorts magiques qu'il lance sur les Cardians pour les animer.${prompt}
The life-bringing magicky used on Cardians is extremely difficult to do.

Wow, j'espère que si je continue à m'entraîner assez dur, je pourrai aussi réaliser toutes sortes de variations de cette magie comme il le fait.${prompt}
Mighty obliged to you there, friend. Your name will go down in Windurstian history for sure now!${prompt};Bien obligé à toi, mon ami. Ton nom restera certainement gravé dans l'histoire de Windurst maintenant !${prompt}
So don't complain if your reward isn't as good as expected, kid.${prompt};Alors ne te plains pas si ta récompense n'est pas aussi bonne que prévue, gamin.${prompt}
This is how we teach the Cardians we create to remember all kinds of things.${prompt};C'est ainsi que nous apprenons aux Cardians que nous créons à se souvenir de toutes sortes de choses.${prompt}
I guess it's kind of like being their mother or father.${prompt};Je suppose que c'est un peu comme être leur mère ou leur père.${prompt}
Hey, you've come back here again?${prompt};Hé, tu es revenu ici ?${prompt}
Oh well, seeing as you're here, you might as well make yourself useful. You see, I've just made another new type of Cardian.

Don't go teachying that kiddy strange wordies! It's practically impossible to make Cardians forgety something once they memorizey it!${prompt};Ne va pas enseigner ces mots étranges aux enfants Cardians ! C'est pratiquement impossible de faire oublier quelque chose aux Cardians une fois qu'ils l'ont mémorisé !${prompt}
That Spare Oney there is but a newborny Cardian! So he memorizes anythingy and everythingy without reservation.${prompt};Ce Cardian Nouveau-né n'est encore qu'un bébé ! Alors il mémorise tout et n'importe quoi sans réserve.${prompt}
The other day Kopuro-Popuro went and taught one of our Kindercardianers the words “hats suck” and upset old Boizo-Naizo to no end.${prompt};"L'autre jour, Kopuro-Popuro est allé enseigner à l'un de nos Kindercardianers les mots ""les chapeaux sucent"" et cela a beaucoup contrarié le vieux Boizo-Naizo.${prompt}"
Newborn Cardians are just like ordinary people's children, so you have to teach them to use words properly-woperly!${prompt};Les Cardians Nouveau-nés sont comme les enfants ordinaires des gens, alors tu dois leur apprendre à utiliser les mots correctement !${prompt}
Hey, you therey!;Hé, toi là-basy !
Remember that Cardiany you taught a silly greeting to the other day?${prompt};Tu te souviens du Cardiany à qui tu as enseigné un salut stupide l'autre jour ?${prompt}
That poor Cardiany just wouldn't forgety the words you taughty it.${prompt};Ce pauvre Cardiany ne voulait tout simplement pas oublier les mots que tu lui as enseignés.${prompt}
Seeing as it was you who taughty the poor thingy an inappropriate greeting, you should take responsibility for your actions and teachy him a correct way of greeting otheries!${prompt};Puisque c'est toi qui as enseigné une salutation inappropriée à ce pauvre petit, tu devrais assumer tes actions et lui enseigner une manière correcte de saluer les autresy !${prompt}
If somethingy's not done, he'll have to livey in embarrassment as a poorly-trained Cardian for the resty of his days. Wouldn't that be a pity-wity?${prompt};Si rien n'est fait, il devra vivre dans l'embarras en tant que Cardian mal formé pour le reste de ses jours. Ne serait-ce pas dommagey ?${prompt}
Think it's pitiable?;Tu trouves ça pitoyable ?
${selection-lines};${selection-lines}
Yes, that's sad.;Oui, c'est triste.
Not really...${prompt};Pas vraiment...${prompt}
You inhumane brutey!;Brute inhumainy !
Have you no feelingies?${prompt};N'as-tu aucun sentimenty ?${prompt}
As Cardians grow up and rise in ranky, their names changey. So, that Spare Cardian you spoke to backy then has a different namey that goes with the position he filledy.${prompt};Au fur et à mesure que les Cardians grandissent et montent en grade, leurs noms changenty. Ainsi, ce Cardian de rechange à qui tu as parlé alors a maintenant un nom différenty qui correspond au poste qu'il a rempli.${prompt}
I think his namey is now Five of something-or-othery...?${prompt};Je crois que son nom est maintenant Cinq de quelque chose...?${prompt}
Well, I don't knowy...!?;Eh bien, je ne saisy pas...!?
Their names changey so much, it's practically impossible to keep tracky of who's who!${prompt};Leurs noms changenty tellement qu'il est pratiquement impossible de savoir qui est qui !${prompt}
Anyway, try going aroundy and talking to the Cardians of each suit with the namey “Five,” and use the greeting you taught him as a signy to tell him apart from the otheries.${prompt};"De toute façon, essaye de te promenery et de parler aux Cardians de chaque groupe avec le nom ""Cinq"" et utilise le salut que tu lui as enseigné comme un signe pour le reconnaître des autres.${prompt}"
The Cardian whose lifey you ruined by teaching him a silly greeting should now be named Five of something-or-othery...?${prompt};Le Cardian dont tu as ruiné la vie en lui enseignant un salut stupide devrait maintenant s'appeler Cinq de quelque chose... ?${prompt}
Anyway, try going aroundy and talking to the Cardians of each suit with the namey “Five,” and use the greeting you taught him as a signy to tell him apart from the otheries.${prompt};"De toute façon, essaye de te promenery et de parler aux Cardians de chaque groupe avec le nom ""Cinq"" et utilise le salut que tu lui as enseigné comme un signe pour le reconnaître des autres.${prompt}"
The Cardians of Windurst are dealt out numbers in the order that they are born. When their numerical predecessor breaks down, all the Cardians below him rise in rank to fill out the numbers of a full deck.${prompt};Les Cardians de Windurst reçoivent des numéros dans l'ordre de leur naissance. Lorsque leur prédécesseur numérique tombe en panne, tous les Cardians en dessous montent en grade pour compléter les numéros d'un jeu complet.${prompt}
So the more Cardians that become run-down or destroyed, the faster the numbers in the names of their successors change.${prompt};Ainsi, plus il y a de Cardians qui deviennent défaillants ou détruits, plus vite les numéros dans les noms de leurs successeurs changent.${prompt}
Oh, you mean that Cardian...? So he's grown up to become number five already, huh?${prompt};Oh, tu veux dire ce Cardian... ? Donc il est déjà devenu le numéro cinq, hein ?${prompt}
<Sigh>...;<Soupir>...
When I hear that, it brings home to me just how short the lifespans of our Cardians are becoming...${prompt};Quand j'entends cela, je réalise à quel point la durée de vie de nos Cardians devient courte...${prompt}
I believe that particular Cardian you speak of was made by Kopuro-Popuro.${prompt};Je crois que ce Cardian particulier dont tu parles a été créé par Kopuro-Popuro.${prompt}
Kopuro-Popuro has a habit of forgetting important things while always remembering the most useless of information. Like father, like son, eh?${prompt};Kopuro-Popuro a l'habitude d'oublier les choses importantes tout en se souvenant toujours des informations les plus inutiles. Tel père, tel fils, hein ?${prompt}
So, did you findy him...?;Alors, l'as-tu trouvé...?
What do you meany, he's outsidey of town? Eh? He's that far away from towny?${prompt};Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire, il est à l'extérieury de la ville ? Hein ? Il est si loin de la villey ?${prompt}
What's he doing in such a dangerous placey? We'd better hurry and send someone out to bring him backy! Here...takey this as a little thank-you for finding himy!${prompt};Qu'est-ce qu'il fait dans un endroit aussi dangereuxy ? On ferait mieux de se dépêcher d'envoyer quelqu'un pour le ramenery ! Tiens...prends ça comme petit remerciement pour l'avoir retrouvéy !${prompt}
If he stays outside of towny too long, there's a chance people might mistakey him for one of those feral Cardians and killy him!${prompt};S'il reste hors de la villey trop longtemps, il y a un risque que les gens le confondent avec l'un de ces Cardians sauvages et le tuenty !${prompt}
What's he doing in such a dangerous placey? We'd better hurry and send someone out to bring him backy!${prompt};Qu'est-ce qu'il fait dans un endroit aussi dangereuxy ? On ferait mieux de se dépêcher d'envoyer quelqu'un pour le ramenery !${prompt}

It is true that the numbers the Cardians are called by change a lot lately, but we should not forget the individual students behind those names.${prompt};Il est vrai que les numéros par lesquels les Cardians sont appelés changent beaucoup ces derniers temps, mais nous ne devrions pas oublier les étudiants individuels derrière ces noms.${prompt}
This facility is different from schools where they teach people how to study-wudy. This is more like a home where we raise children in a loving way.${prompt};Ce lieu est différent des écoles où l'on enseigne comment étudier. C'est plus comme un foyer où nous élevons les enfants de manière aimantey.${prompt}
Say...I wonder whether that Cardian properly forgot the “hats suck” line I taught him?${prompt};Dis...je me demande si ce Cardian a correctement oublié la ligne “les chapeaux sucent” que je lui ai enseignée ?${prompt}
I don't think we should force Cardians to forget things they don't want to forget.${prompt};Je ne pense pas que nous devrions forcer les Cardians à oublier des choses qu'ils ne veulent pas oublier.${prompt}
It wouldn't hurt for our Cardians to have a little more individuality now, would it?${prompt};Un peu plus d'individualité ne ferait pas de mal à nos Cardians, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
We're in deep water, everyone!${prompt};Nous sommes dans de beaux draps, tout le monde !${prompt}
We're in the red again this week.${prompt};Nous sommes encore dans le rouge cette semaine.${prompt}
And after all of those cutbacks we've been implementing lately, too...${prompt};Et après toutes ces réductions que nous avons mises en place récemment, aussi...${prompt}
I'd like to ask you all for ideas... How can we get some gil back into the Manustery's coffers?${prompt};Je voudrais vous demander à tous des idées... Comment pouvons-nous renflouer les caisses du Manustère ?${prompt}
I know, Minister Apururu! It looks like it's time to implement “Legendary Plan B”!${prompt};Je sais, Ministre Apururu ! Il semble que c'est le moment de mettre en œuvre le “Plan B Légendaire” !${prompt}
Legendary-wary?${prompt};Légendaire-waire ?${prompt}
Plan B?${prompt};Plan B ?${prompt}
Long, long ago, our old Manustery was facing a financial crisis much like we are today...${prompt};Il y a longtemps, notre ancien Manustère faisait face à une crise financière tout comme nous aujourd'hui...${prompt}
This was in an age long before airships connected the cities of Vana'diel with the convenient network we have now.${prompt};C'était à une époque bien avant que les aéronefs ne connectent les villes de Vana'diel avec le réseau pratique que nous avons maintenant.${prompt}
Back then, travelers on their way to Jeuno were menaced by fearsome nocturnal-wurnal monsters.${prompt};À cette époque-là, les voyageurs en route vers Jeuno étaient menacés par des monstres nocturne-wurnes redoutables.${prompt}
To brighten up the future for those travelers, our predecessors, in their great wisdom, devised a charm for trekkers they called the “Gadabout's Gris-gris”!${prompt};Pour éclaircir l'avenir de ces voyageurs, nos prédécesseurs, dans leur grande sagesse, ont conçu un charme pour les randonneurs appelé le “Gris-gris du Gadabout” !${prompt}
The effect of these charms was astounding, and the reduction in the number of dangerous incidents that befell Jeuno-bound travelers was significant.${prompt};L'effet de ces charmes était stupéfiant, et la diminution du nombre d'incidents dangereux qui frappaient les voyageurs en direction de Jeuno était significative.${prompt}
Hmm... Oh, really?;Hmm... Oh, vraiment ?
Well, I don't know whether it's true or just an old wives' tale, but we could make a load of gil by selling such charms to the local goods stores, couldn'taru we?${prompt};Eh bien, je ne sais pas si c'est vrai ou juste une vieille histoire de grand-mère, mais on pourrait faire une belle somme de gils en vendant de tels charmes aux magasins locaux, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
That was mighty useful information, especially coming from the likes of Kopuro-Popuro. So, how does one go about making these “Gadabout's Gris-gris” thingamabobs?${prompt};"C'était une information très utile, surtout venant de la part de quelqu'un comme Kopuro-Popuro. Alors, comment fabrique-t-on ces ""Gadabout's Gris-gris"", machin chose ?${prompt}"
Well, you need all kinds of items that nocturnal monsters drop when defeated.${prompt};Eh bien, il vous faut toutes sortes d'objets que les monstres nocturnes laissent tomber quand ils sont vaincus.${prompt}
In order to make a charm, I think we just need: ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt};Pour fabriquer un charme, je pense que nous avons juste besoin de : ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}
I see... Great!;Je vois... Génial !
Then we'll just make a heap of them to sell. We'll have money back in the Manustery's coffers in no time!${prompt};Alors nous allons en fabriquer une tonne à vendre. Nous aurons de l'argent dans les coffres du Manustery en un rien de temps !${prompt}
You'll help us out as well, won'taru you? Please collect one of each of the items that the nocturnal monsters drop.${prompt};Vous nous aiderez aussi, n'est-ce pas ? S'il vous plaît, récupérez un de chaque objet que les monstres nocturnes laissent tomber.${prompt}
Remember, we need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} to make one charm. Good luck, kiddo!${prompt};Rappelez-vous, nous avons besoin de ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} pour fabriquer un charme. Bonne chance, mon p’tit !${prompt}
Hmm...;Hmm...
That's the first I've heard of the Legendary Plan B.${prompt};C'est la première fois que j'entends parler du Plan Légendaire B.${prompt}
I didn't realize our ministry has been this poor for so long! I don't know whether I should take comfort from it, or fall into even further depression...${prompt};Je ne savais pas que notre ministère était aussi pauvre depuis si longtemps ! Je ne sais pas si je devrais m'en réjouir ou sombrer encore plus dans la dépression...${prompt}
So...I wonder how many of these “Gadabout's Gris-gris” thingamabobs we have to make to bring our budget back into the black.${prompt};"Alors... je me demande combien de ces machins ""Gadabout's Gris-gris"" nous devons fabriquer pour remettre notre budget à flot.${prompt}"
Well, finances aren't my concern, so I'll just concentrate on making the goods. I'll just keep making “Gadabout's Gris-gris” until we all drop from exhaustion.${prompt};"Eh bien, les finances ne sont pas mon souci, alors je vais simplement me concentrer sur la fabrication des marchandises. Je continuerai à fabriquer des ""Gadabout's Gris-gris"" jusqu'à ce que nous tombions tous d'épuisement.${prompt}"
We've decided to go aheady with our Legendary Plan B--to make and sell special charmies that protect people who travel by nighty.${prompt};Nous avons décidé de continuer avec notre Plan Légendaire B -- fabriquer et vendre des charmes spéciaux qui protègent les gens qui voyagent la nuit.${prompt}
The best thingy is that they don't require any special magicky--so long as we have the right materialies, they are easy to makey!${prompt};Le meilleur, c'est qu'ils ne nécessitent aucune magie spéciale -- tant que nous avons les bons matériaux, ils sont faciles à fabriquer !${prompt}
Oh, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}... Looks likey we have everything!${prompt};Oh, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}... On dirait que nous avons tout !${prompt}
Here's your cut...;Voici votre part...
Good work, kid!${prompt};Beau travail, mon p'tit !${prompt}
We're in deep water, everyone!${prompt};Nous sommes dans de sales draps, tout le monde !${prompt}
We have mountains of unsold stock! That means mountains of debt!${prompt};Nous avons des montagnes de stock invendu ! Cela signifie des montagnes de dettes !${prompt}
Lately adventurers have been culling nocturnal monsters down to controllable levels, so traveling by night isn't as dangerous as it used to be. This means our charms aren't selling at all!${prompt};Dernièrement, les aventuriers ont réduit les monstres nocturnes à des niveaux contrôlables, donc voyager la nuit n'est plus aussi dangereux qu'avant. Cela signifie que nos charmes ne se vendent pas du tout !${prompt}
I'm putting an end to Legendary Plan B. Now I've got to calculate how much more in the red we are after that harebrained scheme!${prompt};J'arrête le Plan Légendaire B. Maintenant, je dois calculer combien de rouge nous sommes après cette idée saugrenue !${prompt}
Here...I'll give you one, too. Just get the silly thing out of my sighty-wighty!${prompt};Tenez... Je vous en donne aussi un. Sortez-moi cette bêtise de ma vue !${prompt}
<Sigh>...;<Soupir>...
I know, I know...you don't have to tell me. I should have realized this was a stupid idea earlier...${prompt};Je sais, je sais... pas besoin de me le dire. J'aurais dû réaliser que c'était une idée stupide plus tôt...${prompt}
I don't get it...;Je ne comprends pas...
What went wrong with Legendary Plan B?${prompt};Qu'est-ce qui n'a pas fonctionné avec le Plan Légendaire B ?${prompt}
I know...I bet someone deliberately set out to interfere with my plan! Yeah, that's it. Someone must have employed adventurers to go out and hunt nocturnal monsters.${prompt};Je sais... Je parie que quelqu'un s'est délibérément efforcé de saboter mon plan ! Oui, c'est ça. Quelqu'un a dû employer des aventuriers pour sortir et chasser les monstres nocturnes.${prompt}
It just goes to showy...if you have a fingery in more than one pie, you're going to get your fingers burnedy...${prompt};Cela montre bien que si l'on a les doigts dans plusieurs tartes, on risque de se brûler les doigts...${prompt}
That was a good lessony in the nature of businessy. There are pitfalls in diversification after all.${prompt};C'était une bonne leçon sur la nature des affaires. Il y a des pièges dans la diversification après tout.${prompt}
Mountains of unsold stock!;Des montagnes de stock invendu !
Mountains of debt!${prompt};Des montagnes de dettes !${prompt}
Minister Apururu!${wait-animation: 1};Ministre Apururu !${wait-animation: 1}
It's Queen of Hearts, Miss! She's come back all wounded and hurt!${prompt};C'est la Reine de Cœur, Miss ! Elle est revenue toute blessée et mal en point !${prompt}
!!!${prompt};!!!${prompt}
You should stay there, kid. I think the minister is giving Queen of Hearts its last rites.${prompt};Vous devriez rester là, mon p'tit. Je pense que la ministre est en train de faire les derniers rites pour la Reine de Cœur.${prompt}
Queen hAd a hap-py lifE...;La reine a eu une vie heureuse...
Under tHe Blue Skies...!${prompt};Sous les cieux bleus...!${prompt}
Queen's Only Re-gret iS Queen oF Dia-monds dId not mAke iT back hEre tOo...!${prompt};Le seul regret de la reine est que la Reine de Carreau n'est pas revenue ici aussi...!${prompt}
I understand, Queen of Hearts...;Je comprends, Reine de Cœur...
Don't you worry about Queen of Diamonds. I'll look after her...${prompt};Ne vous inquiétez pas pour la Reine de Carreau. Je m'occuperai d'elle...${prompt}
Thank you for a long life of diligent service. Now you can rest in peace, my dear...${prompt};Merci pour une longue vie de service assidu. Maintenant, vous pouvez reposer en paix, ma chère...${prompt}
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting, adventurer. A life had to return to the stars just now...${prompt};Désolée de vous avoir fait attendre, aventurier. Une vie vient de retourner aux étoiles tout à l'heure...${prompt}
She came back all the way here to me, despite her decrepit state...${prompt};Elle est revenue ici malgré son état décrépit...${prompt}
I'm just glad I was able to say a final farewell...${prompt};Je suis juste heureuse d'avoir pu dire un dernier adieu...${prompt}
Well, anyway, adventurer...;Enfin bon, aventurier...
You surely have traveled the world by now and seen many sad things yourself.${prompt};Vous avez sûrement beaucoup voyagé dans le monde et vu beaucoup de choses tristes vous-même.${prompt}
I have a request for one such as you. Please tell me if you happen to find a Cardian named the Queen of Diamonds. I'll pay you ${number: 1} gil for information about her whereabouts.${prompt};J’ai une requête pour quelqu’un comme vous. Dites-moi si vous trouvez par hasard un Cardian nommé la Reine de Carreau. Je vous paierai ${number: 1} gil pour des informations sur son emplacement.${prompt}
If she's on her way here too, then that can only mean she is seriously hurt as well. Please hurry and find her for me...${prompt};Si elle est en route ici aussi, cela signifie qu’elle est sérieusement blessée. S’il vous plaît, dépêchez-vous de la trouver pour moi...${prompt}
I'll pay you ${number: 1} gil for information on the whereabouts of a Cardian called the Queen of Diamonds.${prompt};Je vous paierai ${number: 1} gil pour des informations sur l’emplacement d’un Cardian appelé la Reine de Carreau.${prompt}
If she's on her way here too, then that can only mean she is seriously hurt as well. Please hurry and find her for me...${prompt};Si elle est en route ici aussi, cela signifie qu'elle est sérieusement blessée. S'il vous plaît, dépêchez-vous de la trouver pour moi...${prompt}
No mattery how many times you experience it, saying our last goodbyes to our Cardian kiddies is a sorrowful thingy.${prompt};Peu importe combien de fois vous le vivez, dire nos derniers adieux à nos petits Cardians est une chose douloureuse.${prompt}
<sniff> It's all the more painfuly when it is a Cardiany you breathed life into and raised with your own handies. <sob> Waaah!${prompt};<sniff> C'est d'autant plus douloureux quand c'est un Cardian que vous avez donné vie et élevé de vos propres mains. <sob> Waaah !${prompt}
The Cardian who died just then was one that Minister Apururu raised personally...${prompt};Le Cardian qui est mort tout à l'heure était celui que la ministre Apururu a élevé personnellement...${prompt}
That Cardian was able to make it back here with her remaining strength, but I fear Queen of Diamonds was not so lucky...${prompt};Ce Cardian a pu revenir ici avec sa force restante, mais je crains que la Reine de Carreau n'ait pas été aussi chanceuse...${prompt}
Even if we only find one of her parts, at least we'll be able to give her a proper burial...${prompt};Même si nous trouvons seulement une de ses parties, au moins nous pourrons lui donner une sépulture digne...${prompt}
What the...?;Quoi...?
She's offered to pay you ${number: 1} gil to find our missing Cardian? That's just the kind of stupid thing that puts us further and further into the red!${prompt};Elle vous offre ${number: 1} gils pour retrouver notre Cardian disparu ? C'est exactement ce genre de stupidités qui nous plonge encore plus dans le rouge !${prompt}
If that Cardian's on its way back here, then it only means it's going to kick the bucket at any moment, rightaru?${prompt};Si ce Cardian est en route vers ici, cela signifie seulement qu'il est sur le point de passer l'arme à gauche, non ?${prompt}
So why pay such a high price to find something as drop-dead useless as thataru!?${prompt};Alors pourquoi payer un prix aussi élevé pour retrouver quelque chose d'aussi inutile ?${prompt}
It's like, why spend so much money on silly personal sentiments, when putting that gil towards creating a new Cardian is in everybody's interests?${prompt};C'est comme, pourquoi dépenser autant d'argent pour des sentiments personnels stupides, alors que mettre cet argent pour créer un nouveau Cardian est dans l'intérêt de tous ?${prompt}
I'm sorry, but this time I'm going to have to put it to our Minister quite bluntly-wuntly!${prompt};Désolé, mais cette fois-ci je vais devoir le dire à notre ministre sans détours !${prompt}
Even if you or anyone else finds old Queen of Diamonds for us, we won't be coughing up a single gil, I tell you! I'm totally against such tomfoolery!${prompt};Même si vous ou quelqu'un d'autre retrouvez la vieille Reine de Carreau pour nous, nous ne cracherons pas un seul gil, je vous le dis ! Je suis totalement contre ce genre de bêtises !${prompt}
First, against nature, you go provide lifeforce to empty vessels. Then you send them out into the battlefields. If you're going to cry about it when they drop dead, then you'd might as well not make the damned things to begin with!${prompt};D'abord, contre nature, vous fournissez de la force vitale à des vaisseaux vides. Ensuite, vous les envoyez sur les champs de bataille. Si vous pleurez quand ils crèvent, autant ne pas créer ces fichues choses dès le départ !${prompt}
Even if you or anyone else finds old Queen of Diamonds for us, we won't be coughing up a single gil, I tell you! I'm totally against such tomfoolery!${prompt};Même si vous ou quelqu'un d'autre retrouvez la vieille Reine de Carreau pour nous, nous ne cracherons pas un seul gil, je vous le dis ! Je suis totalement contre ce genre de bêtises !${prompt}
I cannot read the marking, but this is a part of one of our children who left this ministry and died somewhere out there...${prompt};Je ne peux pas lire la marque, mais c'est une partie de l'un de nos enfants qui a quitté ce ministère et est mort quelque part là-bas...${prompt}
Oh...?${prompt};Oh...?${prompt}
What's that I see on this starfruit?${prompt};Qu'est-ce que je vois sur ce fruit d'étoile ?${prompt}
Look how it glitters so beautifully...;Regardez comme il brille si magnifiquement...
And that shape...;Et cette forme...
Why, it almost looks as if it's...${prompt};Pourquoi, on dirait presque que c'est...${prompt}
a...${prompt};un...${prompt}
Here.;Tenez.
Please show this to Boizo-Naizo.${prompt};Veuillez montrer cela à Boizo-Naizo.${prompt}
Please show that starfruit to Boizo-Naizo.${prompt};Veuillez montrer ce fruit d'étoile à Boizo-Naizo.${prompt}
......${prompt};......${prompt}
Oh, that's worthless. Such garbage deserves to be thrown into the trashcan.${prompt};Oh, c'est sans valeur. Une telle poubelle mérite d'être jetée dans la poubelle.${prompt}
Oh, I see you found a piece of her, huh? This nut is indeed part of what was once the great Queen of Diamonds.${prompt};Oh, je vois que vous avez trouvé un morceau d'elle, hein ? Cette noix est en effet une partie de ce qui était autrefois la grande Reine de Carreau.${prompt}
Its marking has worn away, but I know a diamond house when I see it. See, I'm the one who makes the Diamond Cardians, you know?${prompt};Sa marque est effacée, mais je reconnais une maison de diamant quand je vois ça. Voyez-vous, c'est moi qui fabrique les Cardians de Diamants, vous savez ?${prompt}
But I don't intend to pay you a single gil! It's still worthless garbage, even if it was one of my own. I'm different from Minister Apururu, you see. I don't allow my feelings to get caught up in my work...${prompt};Mais je n'ai pas l'intention de vous payer un seul gil ! C'est toujours une poubelle sans valeur, même si c'était l'un des miens. Je suis différent de la ministre Apururu, vous voyez. Je ne laisse pas mes sentiments interférer avec mon travail...${prompt}
...Huh?;...Hein ?
What's this here...?${prompt};Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça...?${prompt}
Was this on the starfruit when you found it?${prompt};Était-ce sur le fruit d'étoile quand vous l'avez trouvé ?${prompt}
This ice...!?;Cette glace... !?
Why, its shape looks...almost like...;Pourquoi, sa forme ressemble... presque à...
...a tear...${prompt};... une larme...${prompt}
Ah...;Ah...
It's melting...${prompt};Elle fond...${prompt}
...;...
Well, I guess the Minister did promise it to you, so...I'll pay you the reward for finding this starfruit.${prompt};Eh bien, je suppose que le ministre vous l'a promis, alors... je vous paierai la récompense pour avoir trouvé cette carambole.${prompt}
But ${number: 1} gil is asking too much. Sorry, but you'll have to make do with ${number: 2} gil.${prompt};Mais ${number: 1} gils, c’est trop demander. Désolé, mais vous devrez vous contenter de ${number: 2} gils.${prompt}
No, I've not become all emotional, mind you! It was just a doll into which we breathed temporary life, rightaru?${prompt};Non, je ne suis pas devenu tout émotif, vous savez ! C’était juste une poupée à laquelle nous avons insufflé temporairement la vie, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
First, against nature, you provide lifeforce to empty vessels. Then you go send them out into the battlefields. If you're going to cry about it when they drop dead, then you'd might as well not make the damned things to begin with!${prompt};D'abord, contre nature, vous fournissez de la force vitale à des vaisseaux vides. Ensuite, vous les envoyez sur les champs de bataille. Si vous allez pleurer quand ils crèvent, autant ne pas créer ces fichues choses dès le départ !${prompt}
Did Boizo-Naizo really just dish out ${number: 2} gil just then?${prompt};Boizo-Naizo a-t-il vraiment donné ${number: 2} gils tout à l’heure ?${prompt}
I don't know where such an amount came from, as our Manustery certainly doesn't have that to spare... Ah!${prompt};Je ne sais pas d’où vient une telle somme, car notre Manustère n’a certainement pas ça à gaspiller... Ah !${prompt}
That's rightaru...he was just saying that he finally saved up enough gil to buy the latest hat creation from the hatter! You don'taru suppose he used that money to pay you, do you?${prompt};C'est vrai, il disait juste qu'il avait enfin économisé assez de gils pour acheter la dernière création de chapeau du chapelier ! Vous ne pensez pas qu'il a utilisé cet argent pour vous payer, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Cardians are life forms born by borrowing the power of the stars. They are just like us--beings with a lifeforce that comes down from the heavens.${prompt};Les Cardians sont des formes de vie nées en empruntant le pouvoir des étoiles. Ils sont tout comme nous, des êtres dotés d'une force vitale qui descend des cieux.${prompt}
So we should never forget...;C'est pourquoi nous ne devrions jamais oublier...
A Cardian's lifeforce is not something we created. We simply called that power down to the earth.${prompt};La force vitale d'un Cardian n'est pas quelque chose que nous avons créé. Nous avons simplement appelé ce pouvoir sur terre.${prompt}
That's why we should send off that life when it leaves the earth, telling it that we hope to meet again.${prompt};C'est pourquoi nous devrions envoyer cette vie lorsqu'elle quitte la terre, en lui disant que nous espérons nous retrouver.${prompt}
Ice in the shapey of a tear...;De la glace en forme de larme...
Ice that didn't melty until it touched the handies of Boizo-Naizo... There are many unexplainable mysteries in this worldy.${prompt};De la glace qui n'a pas fondu jusqu'à ce qu'elle touche les mains de Boizo-Naizo... Il y a beaucoup de mystères inexplicables dans ce monde.${prompt}

Would you mind doin' me a favor the next time yer out thar a-huntin' in Sarutabaruta, and concentrate on depleting the numberrrs of crawlers in them parrrts?${prompt};Je vous le dis... Vous semblez être du genre aventurier maintenant, hein ? Pourriez-vous me rendre un service la prochaine fois que vous chasserez à Sarutabaruta, et vous concentrer sur la réduction du nombre de rampants dans ces parages ?${prompt}
If ya cull enough of them crawlers to git your hands on three ${item-plural: 1[2]} or ${item-plural: 3[2]}, then I'll give you a little somethin' as a rrreward! Whaddaya say?${prompt};Si vous en tuez assez pour mettre la main sur trois ${item-plural: 1[2]} ou ${item-plural: 3[2]}, je vous donnerai quelque chose en récompense ! Qu’en dites-vous ?${prompt}
Help cull them thar crawlers?;Aider à réduire les rampants ?
${selection-lines};${selection-lines}
Yup!;Oui !
Naw!${prompt};Non !${prompt}
I see...;Je vois...
So, y'don't give a damn 'bout what happens to my dhalmel, then do ya? You yellow-strrreaked crrrawler-kisser, you!${prompt};Alors, vous vous fichez de ce qui arrive à mes dhalmels, c'est ça ? Espèce de lâcheur de rampants à rayures jaunes !${prompt}
Crawlers can be found in both East and West Sarutabaruta. So exterrrminate as many of them thar pesty crrritters as you can in both'a them parts.${prompt};Les rampants peuvent être trouvés à la fois dans l'Est et l'Ouest de Sarutabaruta. Donc, exterminez autant de ces sales bestioles que possible dans ces deux parties.${prompt}

Seems like y'did indeed kill off a mighty big numberrr of them thar crawlers. Here's ya rrreward! Much obliged to ya.${prompt};On dirait que tu as vraiment éliminé un bon nombre de ces satanés rampants. Voici ta récompense ! Merci beaucoup à toi.${prompt}
If everrr ya have the time, would ya be so good as to cull some morrre of them thar crawlers for little ol' me? Cull enuff of them critters to git your hands on three ${item-plural: 1[2]} or ${item-plural: 3[2]}, and I'll pay you a handsome rrreward!${prompt};Si jamais tu as le temps, pourrais-tu avoir la gentillesse d’en tuer encore quelques-uns de ces satanés rampants pour moi ? Tue suffisamment de ces bestioles pour mettre la main sur trois ${item-plural: 1[2]} ou ${item-plural: 3[2]}, et je te paierai une belle récompense !${prompt}
You saw them towerrrs out thar in Sarutabaruta, huh? Why, they be called the Horutoto Ruins. Once they broke down, the animals of Sarutabaruta starrrted runnin' amuck, y'know?${prompt};Tu as vu ces tours là-bas à Sarutabaruta, hein ? Elles sont appelées les Ruines de Horutoto. Une fois qu'elles sont tombées en ruine, les animaux de Sarutabaruta ont commencé à courir partout, tu sais ?${prompt}
I ain't got much of a clue what them towers was forrr, but they sure was magical. I wonderrr if they'll e'er be able to fix them up again?${prompt};J'ai pas beaucoup d'idée à quoi servaient ces tours, mais elles étaient certainement magiques. Je me demande si un jour elles pourront les réparer ?${prompt}
In Mother Nature, there is nothing that is without purrrpose...nothing is wasted. Both you and I are here for some rrreason.${prompt};Dans la nature, rien n'est sans but... rien n'est gaspillé. Toi et moi sommes ici pour une raison.${prompt}
One should never waste naturrre's gifts, and never take a life, no matter how small, without properrr cause. That is the hunting code we rangers are sworn to uphold.${prompt};On ne devrait jamais gaspiller les cadeaux de la nature, et ne jamais prendre une vie, aussi petite soit-elle, sans cause justifiée. C'est le code de la chasse que nous, rangers, sommes tenus de respecter.${prompt}
Please do not botherrr us now. We are in the midst of offerrring our prayers for a great hunt.${prompt};S'il te plaît, ne nous dérange pas maintenant. Nous sommes en train d'offrir nos prières pour une grande chasse.${prompt}
We rangers must show gratitude for naturrre's blessings as we carry out the hunt. For we too are part of Mother Nature's grrreater scheme...${prompt};Nous, rangers, devons montrer notre gratitude pour les bénédictions de la nature pendant que nous menons la chasse. Car nous aussi, nous faisons partie du grand dessein de Mère Nature...${prompt}
Have you everrr thought about how the food you eat each day arrives on your plate?${prompt};As-tu déjà réfléchi à la manière dont la nourriture que tu manges chaque jour arrive sur ton assiette ?${prompt}
Yes. When we die, we too will be eaten by someone or something. In the end, we all returrrn to the earth to serve as nutrients for otherrr living things.${prompt};Oui. Quand nous mourrons, nous aussi serons mangés par quelqu'un ou quelque chose. En fin de compte, nous retournons tous à la terre pour servir de nutriments à d'autres êtres vivants.${prompt}
You are entering into the prrresence of Chieftainness Perih Vashai, the one who unifies the Mithra of Windurst.${prompt};Tu entres dans la présence de la Cheftaine Perih Vashai, celle qui unifie les Mithra de Windurst.${prompt}
Verily, she is the Mithran heroine who wields the crrrimson arrow and the azure bow. Be carrreful, lest you are overwhelmed by her peaceful vigor.${prompt};En vérité, elle est l'héroïne Mithra qui manie la flèche cramoisie et l'arc azuré. Sois prudent, de peur d'être submergé par sa vigueur pacifique.${prompt}
Blessed is the one with the crimson tides flooding through herrr breast and the azure glow beaming from herrr eyes.${prompt};Béni soit celui avec les marées cramoisies inondant son sein et la lueur azur émanant de ses yeux.${prompt}
Forrr only one such as that may inherit the chieftainness's bow and arrow.${prompt};Car seul un tel individu peut hériter de l'arc et de la flèche de la cheftaine.${prompt}
I brought my daughterrr here to meet the tribal chieftainness, and have herrr highness see just how the child is grrrowing.${prompt};J'ai amené ma fille ici pour rencontrer la cheftaine tribale, et pour que son altesse voie à quel point l'enfant grandit.${prompt}
The chieftainness inculcated my daughter on the Mithra spirit--the teachings of a people in harrrmony with naturrre. This is just as my motherrr had done forrr me.${prompt};La cheftaine a inculqué à ma fille l'esprit Mithra - les enseignements d'un peuple en harmonie avec la nature. C'est exactement ce que ma mère a fait pour moi.${prompt}
Wanna know why the chieftainness keeps herrr eyes closed all the time?${prompt};Tu veux savoir pourquoi la cheftaine garde toujours ses yeux fermés ?${prompt}
It's so she can hearrr the voice of naturrre betterrr!${prompt};C'est pour qu'elle puisse mieux entendre la voix de la nature !${prompt}
Have you hearrrd, adventurer?;As-tu entendu, aventurier ?
Our world is once again in an uproarrr.${prompt};Notre monde est à nouveau en émoi.${prompt}
We are on the path to great wars and the spilling of much blood. If those times do indeed come, I shall be forrrced to hand the bow of the chieftainness on to a Mithra who has found a new road to walk, one who has new drrreams for her people.${prompt};Nous sommes sur la voie des grandes guerres et du répandage de beaucoup de sang. Si ces temps viennent vraiment, je serai forcé de transmettre l'arc de la cheftaine à une Mithra qui aura trouvé une nouvelle voie à parcourir, une qui a de nouveaux rêves pour son peuple.${prompt}
We have received worrrd from Rakoh Buuma, captain of the eastern gatehouse.${prompt};Nous avons reçu des nouvelles de Rakoh Buuma, capitaine de la porte est.${prompt}
We are afraid it is ratherrr ill news. Nothing good happens on days when the wind blows warrrm.${prompt};Nous avons peur que ce soit plutôt de mauvaises nouvelles. Rien de bon n'arrive les jours où le vent souffle chaud.${prompt}
What we fearrr is about to happen is by no means certain. However, if our worst fears come to pass, then we will need a strong chieftainness who can rrraise the lands and lead our arrrmies.${prompt};Ce que nous craignons est sur le point de se produire n'est en aucun cas certain. Cependant, si nos pires craintes se réalisent, alors nous aurons besoin d'une cheftaine forte capable de lever les terres et de diriger nos armées.${prompt}
We cannot ask this of our elderrrly chieftainness. Will we need to select a new leaderrr even while our current chieftainness still lives...?${prompt};Nous ne pouvons pas demander cela à notre cheftaine âgée. Aurons-nous besoin de choisir un nouveau leader même lorsque notre cheftaine actuelle est toujours en vie... ?${prompt}
Have you hearrrd, adventurer? There appears to have been a grrreat battle far off in the Northlands.${prompt};As-tu entendu, aventurier ? Il semble qu'il y ait eu une grande bataille loin dans les Terres du Nord.${prompt}
I assume the worrrld will quiet down for a while now. However, the hearts of the Mithra will continue to clamorrr, for we Mithra know that nothing has rrreally ended at all.${prompt};J'imagine que le monde va se calmer un moment maintenant. Cependant, les cœurs des Mithra continueront à tambouriner, car nous, Mithra, savons que rien n'a vraiment pris fin du tout.${prompt}
Why? Why is it that my hearrrtbeat will not settle down?${prompt};Pourquoi ? Pourquoi mon cœur ne se calme-t-il pas ?${prompt}
Lo! The chieftainness appearrrs to be sensing something. What is going to happen next?${prompt};Eh bien ! La cheftaine semble percevoir quelque chose. Que va-t-il se passer ensuite ?${prompt}
No one is willing to say it out loud, but we all feel that something is about to occurrr.${prompt};Personne ne veut le dire à voix haute, mais nous sentons tous que quelque chose est sur le point de se produire.${prompt}
It was exactly the same twenty years ago. There was a grrreat sense of loss back then, as if some grrrand presence had suddenly disappeared. But what was it that was lost?${prompt};C'était exactement la même chose il y a vingt ans. Il y avait un grand sentiment de perte à l'époque, comme si une grande présence avait soudainement disparu. Mais qu'était-ce qui était perdu ?${prompt}
In Mother Nature, there is nothing that is without purrrpose...nothing is wasted. Both you and I are here for some rrreason.${prompt};Dans la nature, rien n'est sans but... rien n'est gaspillé. Toi et moi sommes ici pour une raison.${prompt}
One should never waste naturrre's gifts, and never take a life, no matter how small, without properrr cause. That is the hunting code we rangers are sworn to uphold.${prompt};On ne devrait jamais gaspiller les cadeaux de la nature, et ne jamais prendre une vie, aussi petite soit-elle, sans cause justifiée. C'est le code de la chasse que nous, rangers, sommes tenus de respecter.${prompt}
Have you, my child, trod on many a land, drunk from many a rrrainfall, fought many a fine battle, and lived to see many a dawn?${prompt};As-tu, mon enfant, foulé de nombreuses terres, bu de nombreuses pluies, combattu de nombreuses batailles et vécu pour voir de nombreux aurores ?${prompt}
Then truly I say unto you, unless you are apprrroved by the earth and the sky, how is it that you can say you are accepted by Mother Nature?${prompt};Alors je te le dis en vérité, à moins que tu ne sois approuvé par la terre et le ciel, comment peux-tu dire que tu es accepté par Mère Nature ?${prompt}
If you so desire to submit yourself to the laws of naturrre, my child, then go, meet with the fanged king of the beasts, and bring back one of his grrreat teeth.${prompt};Si tu désires te soumettre aux lois de la nature, mon enfant, alors va, rencontre le roi denté des bêtes et ramène une de ses grandes dents.${prompt}
Listen to the voice of nature and wait for nature to run herrr course. If nature accepts us, then even we who lack fangs will be perrrmitted to hunt as her rangers.${prompt};Écoute la voix de la nature et attends que la nature suive son cours. Si la nature nous accepte, alors même nous qui manquons de crocs seront autorisés à chasser comme ses rangers.${prompt}
My child, if you desire to submit yourself to the laws of naturrre, then go, meet with the fanged king of the beasts, and bring back one of his grrreat teeth.${prompt};Mon enfant, si tu désires te soumettre aux lois de la nature, alors va, rencontre le roi denté des bêtes et ramène une de ses grandes dents.${prompt}
Listen to the voice of nature and wait for nature to run herrr course. If nature accepts us, then even we who lack fangs will be perrrmitted to hunt as her rangers.${prompt};Écoute la voix de la nature et attends que la nature suive son cours. Si la nature nous accepte, alors même nous qui manquons de crocs seront autorisés à chasser comme ses rangers.${prompt}
The fanged king of the beasts is one of the grrreat tigers. It is a fearsome monster with swift feet and awesome power. Its teeth are very light yet extremely strong, perrrfect for making the best arrowheads.${prompt};Le roi denté des bêtes est l'un des grands tigres. C'est un monstre redoutable avec des pieds rapides et une puissance impressionnante. Ses dents sont très légères mais extrêmement solides, parfaites pour fabriquer les meilleures pointes de flèches.${prompt}
From long ago they have dwelled on the Sauromugue Champaign, and we have learrrned much from them.${prompt};Depuis longtemps, ils habitent sur la Plaine Sauromugue, et nous avons beaucoup appris d'eux.${prompt}
What is it you want to learrrn from us, the people of nature?${prompt};Qu'est-ce que tu veux apprendre de nous, le peuple de la nature ?${prompt}
While you say you want to leave some legacy for the futurrre, you plunderrr whatever you can here and now.${prompt};Tandis que vous dites vouloir laisser un héritage pour l'avenir, vous pillez tout ce que vous pouvez ici et maintenant.${prompt}
If you stopped for a moment and thought, you would rrrealize that at this rate you will have nothing left to give yourrr descendants.${prompt};Si vous vous arrêtiez un moment et réfléchissiez, vous vous rendriez compte qu'à ce rythme, vous n'aurez rien laissé à vos descendants.${prompt}
Those who say they want to leave some legacy for the future, while plunderrring whatever they can here and now, live contrary to nature.${prompt};Ceux qui disent vouloir laisser un héritage pour l'avenir, tout en pillant tout ce qu'ils peuvent ici et maintenant, vivent à l'encontre de la nature.${prompt}
If they stopped for a moment and thought, they would rrrealize that at this rate they will have nothing left to give theirrr descendants.${prompt};S'ils s'arrêtaient un instant et réfléchissaient, ils se rendraient compte qu'à ce rythme, ils n'auront rien laissé à leurs descendants.${prompt}
Why, my child, did you cause yet anotherrr of nature's wonderrrs to die meaninglessly? It is useless to even try and explain this fang's meaning to one such as you.${prompt};Pourquoi, mon enfant, as-tu causé encore une autre des merveilles de la nature à mourir de manière insignifiante ? Il est inutile d'essayer d'expliquer cette signification de croc à quelqu'un comme toi.${prompt}
For the hunterrr, the fangs are not just a tool vital for existence, but also a witness to its death. If the fanged one loses its fangs, it can no longerrr live. Yet when the fanged one dies, only its fangs rrremain.${prompt};Pour le chasseur, les crocs ne sont pas seulement un outil vital pour l'existence, mais aussi un témoin de sa mort. Si celui aux crocs perd ses crocs, il ne peut plus vivre. Pourtant, quand celui aux crocs meurt, seuls ses crocs restent.${prompt}
To hunt like the fanged one, you must live by the fang and die leaving only the fang behind.${prompt};Pour chasser comme celui aux crocs, tu dois vivre par le croc et mourir en ne laissant que le croc derrière toi.${prompt}
Onto you, our new ranger, I bestow the witness of the life and death of the grrreat fanged one...${prompt};À toi, notre nouveau ranger, je te confie le témoin de la vie et de la mort du grand celui aux crocs...${prompt}
You can now become a ranger!${prompt};Désormais, tu peux devenir un ranger !${prompt}
The one unto whom Mother Nature has bestowed her fangs must neverrr fight without reason.${prompt};Celle à qui Mère Nature a conféré ses crocs ne doit jamais se battre sans raison.${prompt}
Glorrry to the fangs of the fanged one. Listen to the voice of nature and follow her courrrse. The sky and earrrth shall tell you the time to fight and the time to die.${prompt};Gloire aux crocs de celui aux crocs. Écoute la voix de la nature et suis son cours. Le ciel et la terre te diront quand combattre et quand mourir.${prompt}
Why do you suppose people lost their fangs? Perrrhaps it was because people stopped listening to nature's voice.${prompt};Pourquoi penses-tu que les gens ont perdu leurs crocs ? Peut-être parce que les gens ont arrêté d'écouter la voix de la nature.${prompt}
That weapon you hold in your hands is but a temporrrary manifestation of a fang. Your true fangs exist within your hearrrt!${prompt};Cette arme que tu tiens dans tes mains n'est qu'une manifestation temporaire d'un croc. Tes vrais crocs existent dans ton cœur !${prompt}
There are no meaningless lives in this worrrld, yet there are a great numberrr of meaningless deaths.${prompt};Il n'y a pas de vies sans signification dans ce monde, mais il y a un grand nombre de morts sans signification.${prompt}
Never forrrget, fanged one...;N'oublie jamais, celui aux crocs...
Never forrrget the sinfulness and folly of causing an unnecessary death.${prompt};N'oublie jamais la faute et la folie de causer une mort inutile.${prompt}
Hey! What do you want?;Hé ! Que veux-tu ?
Don't tell me...${prompt};Ne me dis pas...${prompt}
You heard that I have a monster correlation chart and came to beg me to show it to you, rrright?${prompt};Tu as entendu que j'ai un diagramme de corrélation des monstres et tu es venu me supplier de te le montrer, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Look at the tattered diagram?;Regarder le diagramme déchiré ?
${selection-lines};${selection-lines}
Yes.;Oui.
No.${prompt};Non.${prompt}
Oh, so you're just trying to flirt with me, huh? Well, sorry there, but I'm not interrrested in men or women. The only thing that makes my heart leap are the tracks and droppings of my next hunting game, thank you.${prompt};Oh, donc tu essaies juste de flirter avec moi, hein ? Désolé, mais je ne suis intéressé ni par les hommes ni par les femmes. La seule chose qui fait battre mon cœur, ce sont les traces et les déjections de ma prochaine proie de chasse, merci.${prompt}
I knew it!;Je le savais !
Alrrright then. I don't mind showing it to you. Besides, I'm a topnotch hunter, so I don't need it anyway.${prompt};Très bien alors. Ça ne me dérange pas de te le montrer. Après tout, je suis un chasseur de premier ordre, donc je n'en ai pas vraiment besoin.${prompt}
I was given this parchment a few years ago by a scrrruffy old Elvaan man. I helped him out when I found him lost in the woods, and this was his way of paying me back.${prompt};On m'a donné ce parchemin il y a quelques années par un vieil Elvaan mal dégrossi. Je l'ai aidé quand je l'ai trouvé perdu dans les bois, et c'était sa façon de me rendre la pareille.${prompt}
To tell you the truth, I wasn't that interested in it, so I didn't pay much attention to his explanation and have forrrgotten most of what he said.${prompt};Pour tout te dire, je n'étais pas tellement intéressé, alors je n'ai pas fait beaucoup attention à son explication et j'ai presque tout oublié de ce qu'il a dit.${prompt}
It was something about how the different types of monsters eat each other in order to surrrvive, so I guess he was trying to tell me to referrr to this pattern when I go hunting.${prompt};C'était quelque chose à propos de comment les différents types de monstres se mangent les uns les autres pour survivre, alors je suppose qu'il essayait de me dire de me référer à ce schéma quand je chasse.${prompt}
But whenever I spot a monster, I become totally obsessed by the thought of the hunt and forrrget all about his advice and this chart.${prompt};Mais chaque fois que je repère un monstre, je deviens complètement obsédé par la pensée de la chasse et j'oublie tout conseil et ce diagramme.${prompt}
Maybe it's enough to just keep this knowledge locked away in the back of your mind somewhere, in case you ever need it. But if you want to know more, then you'll just have to go and track down that old guy.${prompt};Peut-être suffit-il de garder cette connaissance enfouie quelque part dans un coin de ton esprit, au cas où tu en aurais besoin. Mais si tu veux en savoir plus, alors il faudra juste que tu retrouves ce vieil homme.${prompt}
You're welcome to have another gander at this chart whenever you want to. It's a pain to explain it to everyone who asks, but maybe it is some kind of fate... Actually, I've found that I enjoy helping people out.${prompt};Tu es le bienvenu pour jeter un autre coup d'œil à ce diagramme quand tu veux. C'est pénible de l'expliquer à chaque personne qui le demande, mais peut-être que c'est une sorte de destin... En fait, j'ai découvert que j'apprécie aider les gens.${prompt}

Ho-hum...ho-hum... There, it's all settled. You now have your own Rent-a-Room preparrred for your use in Windurst's residential area behind me. Have a pleasant stay.${prompt};Ho-hum... ho-hum... Voilà, tout est réglé. Vous avez maintenant votre propre chambre à louer prête pour votre usage dans la zone résidentielle de Windurst derrière moi. Bon séjour.${prompt}
What's up with you? Why are you standing there in a daze?${prompt};Qu'est-ce qui se passe avec vous ? Pourquoi restez-vous là à rêvasser ?${prompt}
Hmm... You call yourself an adventurrrer? I guess if one stretches her imagination enough, you could almost look like one.${prompt};Hmm... Vous vous appelez aventurier ? Je suppose que si on étire assez l'imagination, on pourrait presque le croire.${prompt}
Let me take a stab in the darrrk and guess that this is your first time in Windurst.${prompt};Permettez-moi de deviner que c'est votre première fois à Windurst.${prompt}
First time in Windurst?;Première fois à Windurst ?
${selection-lines};${selection-lines}
Yes.;Oui.
No.${prompt};Non.${prompt}
Well then, welcome...;Eh bien alors, bienvenue...
Yes, welcome to peaceful old Windurrrst. Scaredy-cats who have been dumbed down by the peace are enthusiastically received here.${prompt};Oui, bienvenue dans la paisible vieille Windurst. Les peureux qui ont été endormis par la paix sont accueillis avec enthousiasme ici.${prompt}
Good try...;Bon essai...
But if you're going to deceive people, you should at least learn how to lie properrrly.${prompt};Mais si vous allez tromper les gens, vous devriez au moins apprendre à mentir correctement.${prompt}
Where are you heading?;Où allez-vous ?
What brings you to town?${prompt};Qu'est-ce qui vous amène en ville ?${prompt}
What do you want to do right now?;Que voulez-vous faire maintenant ?
${selection-lines};${selection-lines}
Head outside and battle.;Sortir et combattre.
Go shopping.;Faire du shopping.
Gather information.;Rassembler des informations.
Where am I? Who am I?${prompt};Où suis-je ? Qui suis-je ?${prompt}
Grrr... You'rrre more hot-blooded than you look. I could almost come to like you.${prompt};Grrr... Tu es plus ardent que tu n'en as l'air. Je pourrais presque bien t'apprécier.${prompt}
But judging from your delicate appearrrance, I'd say you'd be lucky to beat a rarab, let alone a mandragorrra, out there in Sarutabaruta.${prompt};Mais à en juger par ton apparence délicate, je dirais que tu serais chanceux de battre un rarab, encore moins une mandragore, là-bas à Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
Oh, in case you didn't know, Sarutabaruta is the name of the grasslands that surround Windurst.${prompt};Oh, au cas où tu ne le saurais pas, Sarutabaruta est le nom des plaines qui entourent Windurst.${prompt}
If you go back up that slope behind you and pass through the gatehouse, you will come to East Sarutabaruta.${prompt};Si tu remontes cette pente derrière toi et que tu passes par la porte, tu arriveras à l'est de Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
Sarutabaruta is full of weak monsters, so even a newbie like you can try to hunt there.${prompt};Sarutabaruta est plein de monstres faibles, donc même un débutant comme toi peut essayer de chasser là-bas.${prompt}
But be warrrned.;Mais sois averti.
The furrrther you go away from town the strongerrr the monsters become, so keep an eye on your map.${prompt};Plus tu t'éloignes de la ville, plus les monstres deviennent forts, alors garde un œil sur ta carte.${prompt}
Ask your fellow adventurers for details on the best way to fight or flee. I can't be botherrred telling you myself.${prompt};Demande à tes camarades aventuriers pour des détails sur la meilleure façon de combattre ou de fuir. Je ne vais pas me donner la peine de te le dire moi-même.${prompt}

Nanaa Mihgo's lesson on Windurst is overrr. I've discounted your tuition fee to a mere 1000 gil. Come on then, cough it up.${prompt};La leçon de Nanaa Mihgo sur Windurst est terminée. J'ai réduit tes frais de scolarité à seulement 1000 gils. Allez, paie.${prompt}
Pay the tuition fee?;Payer les frais de scolarité ?
${selection-lines};${selection-lines}
No way!;Pas question !
Well, er, okay...${prompt};Bon, euh, d'accord...${prompt}
What!? You won't pay me even a simple compliment, despite my kindly assistance!? Don't you know basic adventurrrer's etiquette?${prompt};Quoi !? Tu ne me paieras même pas un simple compliment, malgré mon aimable assistance !? Ne connais-tu pas l'étiquette élémentaire de l'aventurier ?${prompt}
Show me how much you've got in your purrrse.${prompt};Montre-moi ce que tu as dans ta bourse.${prompt}
You catch on quick, kid. I'm beginning to think I could like you.${prompt};Tu saisis vite, gamin. Je commence à penser que je pourrais bien t'apprécier.${prompt}
Hold it right there!${prompt};Arrête-toi là !${prompt}
Nanaa Mihgo!!!;Nanaa Mihgo !!!
You're up to your old tricks of duping travelers out of their hard-earned gil, aren't you?${prompt};Tu continues tes vieux tours pour escroquer les voyageurs de leur gil durement gagné, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
We, the “Star Onion Brigade,” won't let you get away with it!${prompt};Nous, la “Brigade des Étoiles d'Oignon”, ne te laisserons pas t'en sortir comme ça !${prompt}
Grrr, not those S.O.B.'s again!;Grrr, pas ces S.O.B. encore !
I would've gotten away with it, if it weren't for you meddling kids!${prompt};J'aurais réussi à m'en sortir, si ce n'était pour vous, gamins intrusifs !${prompt}
Due to this disturrrbance, I'll have to end your lesson forrr today!${prompt};En raison de ce dérangement, je vais devoir mettre fin à ta leçon pour aujourd'hui !${prompt}
We'll continue anotherrr day, and that's when I'll collect my fee.${prompt};Nous continuerons un autre jour, et c'est là que je collecterai mes frais.${prompt}
Hey, she's getting away!;Hé, elle s'enfuit !
After her!${prompt};Après elle !${prompt}
He～y, don't run so fasty-wasty!${prompt};Hé～y, ne cours pas si vite !${prompt}
<Sigh>......${prompt};<Soupir>......${prompt}
Dat mithwa is a weally bad mithwa we all call da Cat Burglar.${prompt};Ce mithwa est un vilain mithwa que nous appelons tous le Voleur de Chats.${prompt}
If you need weal help, head towards da fountain. Jack of Spades is on guard around dere. He will teach you all you need to know. Check da “Map” to find da way dere.${prompt};Si tu as besoin d'une vraie aide, dirige-toi vers la fontaine. Jack of Spades est en poste là-bas. Il t'enseignera tout ce que tu as besoin de savoir.

Nous sommes la Brigade de l'Oignon Étoilé ! Nous sommes les protecteurs d'un avenir plus brillant ! Ça vaut la peine de se souvenir de nous !${prompt}
What the...? Shopping?;Quoi... ? Faire des achats ?
Asking me's a waste of time.${prompt};Me poser la question est une perte de temps.${prompt}
I mean a waste of my time, not yourrrs! If you must ask, then all I can recommend is to head to Port Windurst.${prompt};Je veux dire une perte de mon temps, pas du vôtre ! Si vous devez demander, alors tout ce que je peux recommander, c'est de vous diriger vers le port de Windurst.${prompt}
To get there, head down the road on the otherrr side of this fountain round.${prompt};Pour y aller, suivez la route de l'autre côté de cette fontaine.${prompt}
Once in the porrrt, head down to the wharves, where there are three boat-shaped shops. They house a magic shop, an armor shop, and a weapon shop.${prompt};Une fois au port, descendez vers les quais, où il y a trois boutiques en forme de bateau. Elles abritent une boutique de magie, une boutique d'armures et une boutique d'armes.${prompt}
If you're looking for shops in the Windurst Woods area, there's a general goods store far over on the otherrr side of those tents there. You'll find the Boneworkers' Guild and Weavers' Guild shops back behind therrre too!${prompt};Si vous cherchez des boutiques dans la région du Bois de Windurst, il y a un magasin de produits généraux tout au fond, de l'autre côté de ces tentes là-bas. Vous trouverez aussi les boutiques de la Guilde des Travailleurs de l'Os et de la Guilde des Tisserands derrière là-bas !${prompt}
And up behind the dhalmel farm, therrre's a Mithra apothecary.${prompt};Et derrière la ferme de dhalmel, il y a une apothicaire mithra.${prompt}
You should know this already, but you can make money by selling the items that monsters drop after you defeat them. You can use the gil earrrned to buy whatever you want.${prompt};Vous devriez déjà le savoir, mais vous pouvez gagner de l'argent en vendant les objets que les monstres laissent tomber après les avoir vaincus. Vous pouvez utiliser l'argent gagné pour acheter ce que vous voulez.${prompt}
The best way to gather inforrrmation is to speak to all the townsfolk.${prompt};Le meilleur moyen de recueillir des informations est de parler à tous les habitants de la ville.${prompt}
Today I'll throw in some special tidbits for free...but just this once. What kind of information in particularrr are you interested in?${prompt};Aujourd'hui, je vais vous donner quelques informations spéciales gratuitement... mais juste cette fois. Quel type d'information vous intéresse particulièrement ?${prompt}
Ask for information on...?;Demander des informations sur... ?
${selection-lines};${selection-lines}
Helping people.;Aider les gens.
Monster patrol.;Patrouille contre les monstres.
Easy money.;Facile à gagner.
Looking for work.${prompt};Recherche de travail.${prompt}
Why not try the Manustery's Cardian worrrkshop up there? You won't only be helping people, but Cardians as well.${prompt};Pourquoi ne pas essayer l'atelier Cardian du Manustery là-haut ? Vous n'aiderez pas seulement les gens, mais aussi les Cardians.${prompt}
Oh, Cardians are the magical automatons that function as the guarrrds of Windurst.${prompt};Oh, les Cardians sont les automates magiques qui fonctionnent comme les gardes de Windurst.${prompt}
If you go in that workshop there, you'll see morrre of them than you probably want to.${prompt};Si vous entrez dans cet atelier là-bas, vous en verrez plus que vous ne le voudriez probablement.${prompt}
Perrrsonally, I'd prefer if all the Cardians were rounded up and destroyed.${prompt};Personnellement, je préférerais que tous les Cardians soient rassemblés et détruits.${prompt}
Hah! If therrre was such sweet talk of fast money, I'd have done it already.${prompt};Hah ! S'il y avait autant de belles promesses de gains rapides, je l'aurais déjà fait.${prompt}
But wait a second.;Mais attendez une seconde.
Let me see... What could be suitable for a newbie like you...?${prompt};Laissez-moi voir... Qu'est-ce qui pourrait convenir à un débutant comme vous... ?${prompt}
You know the Boneworrrkers' Guild to the south of here? If you diligently practice that trade skill, you might make some money out of synthesizing and selling items.${prompt};Connaissez-vous la Guilde des Ouvriers de l'Os au sud d'ici ? Si vous pratiquez assidûment ce métier, vous pourriez gagner de l'argent en synthétisant et en vendant des objets.${prompt}
You'rrre not going to strike it rich right away, but it's a relatively easy way to make money. Hey, it's a start, right?${prompt};Vous ne deviendrez pas riche du jour au lendemain, mais c'est un moyen relativement facile de gagner de l'argent. Eh bien, c'est un début, non ?${prompt}
Norrrmally, I'd say, “Go out and slaughter those Yagudo beastmen”!${prompt};Normalement, je dirais : « Allez massacrer ces Yagudo ! »${prompt}
But the Tarutaru of Windurrrst like to keep the peace and are trying to be friends with the Yagudo.${prompt};Mais les Tarutaru de Windurst préfèrent maintenir la paix et essaient d'être amis avec les Yagudo.${prompt}
So at this point, all I can recommend to you is the dhalmel farrrm.${prompt};À ce stade, tout ce que je peux vous recommander, c'est la ferme de dhalmel.${prompt}
If you head north from here, you'll see the long necks of the dhalmel sticking up over the farrrm's walkway. Inquire with the farrrmer. She's grateful for any help she can get.${prompt};Si vous partez vers le nord à partir d'ici, vous verrez les longs cous des dhalmel dépassant de la passerelle de la ferme. Renseignez-vous auprès du fermier. Elle est reconnaissante pour toute aide.${prompt}
Looking for worrrk, huh? Then head to one of the gatehouses.${prompt};Vous cherchez du travail, hein ? Alors rendez-vous à l'une des guérites.${prompt}
There's one right behind you. The stone building there is the Eastern Gatehouse. It's swarrrming with those preening Mithra guards.${prompt};Il y en a une juste derrière vous. Le bâtiment en pierre là-bas est la Guérite Est. Elle est grouillante de ces gardes Mithra qui se pavanent.${prompt}
You can receive missions from the gatehouses if you're into volunteerrring for your country. Perrrsonally, I don't care much for it myself, so ask for details at the gatehouse.${prompt};Vous pouvez recevoir des missions des guérites si vous aimez vous porter volontaire pour votre pays. Personnellement, ça ne m'intéresse pas beaucoup, alors demandez des détails à la guérite.${prompt}
Missions are tasks from and on behalf of the Federation of Windurst, and differrr from the requests for help from general townsfolk.${prompt};Les missions sont des tâches de et pour le compte de la Fédération de Windurst, et diffèrent des demandes d'aide des habitants ordinaires.${prompt}
For instance, if you do so-and-so a mission, you are rewarrrded with a set number of rank points.${prompt};Par exemple, si vous accomplissez une mission, vous recevez un certain nombre de points de rang.${prompt}
Collect enough rank points and your rank or position in this country will rise. But as far as I'm concerned, the rewards aren't worrrth the effort.${prompt};Accumulez suffisamment de points de rang et votre rang ou votre position dans ce pays augmentera. Mais pour ce qui me concerne, les récompenses ne valent pas l'effort.${prompt}
Hm? You don't know left from right? You poorrr thing.${prompt};Hein ? Vous ne savez pas où vous mettez les pieds ? Pauvre de vous.${prompt}
This is Windurst Woods, the easternmost of the fourrr districts of Windurst.${prompt};Nous sommes dans les Bois de Windurst, le district le plus à l'est des quatre districts de Windurst.${prompt}
Seeing as we're nearrr the Bomingo Round here, I'll use it as the starting point of my explanation.${prompt};Comme nous sommes près du Bomingo Round ici, je vais l'utiliser comme point de départ pour mon explication.${prompt}
Firrrst, if you head south from the round, there are several shops run by the local craftswomen.${prompt};Tout d'abord, si vous partez vers le sud depuis le rond-point, vous trouverez plusieurs boutiques tenues par les artisanes locales.${prompt}
There's the Weavers' Guild, which is the specialty of the Tarutaru, and there's the Boneworkers' Guild. which is more the Mithra's forte. These are the pride and joy of Windurst.${prompt};Il y a la Guilde des Tisserands, qui est la spécialité des Tarutaru, et il y a la Guilde des Ouvriers de l'Os, qui est plus le domaine des Mithra. Ce sont la fierté et la joie de Windurst.${prompt}
If you head north from the round, you'll find roads that lead to the dhalmel farm and Chocobo Stables. Just follow the sweet smell of naturrre.${prompt};Si vous partez vers le nord depuis le rond-point, vous trouverez des routes menant à la ferme de dhalmel et aux Écuries de Chocobos. Suivez simplement l'agréable odeur de la nature.${prompt}
Take the road norrrth, and you'll find an apothecary mixed among the Mithra Groves with the Mithra houses. Take the road south, and you'll find an auction house.${prompt};Prenez la route vers le nord, et vous trouverez une apothicaire mêlée parmi les bosquets Mithra avec les maisons Mithra. Prenez la route vers le sud, et vous trouverez une maison de vente aux enchères.${prompt}
Compared to the other districts, there's hardly any Tarutaru buildings in Windurst Woods at all. However, the Manustery, one of the five ministries, is right therrre.${prompt};Comparé aux autres districts, il n'y a presque pas de bâtiments Tarutaru dans les Bois de Windurst du tout. Cependant, le Manustery, l'un des cinq ministères, est juste là-bas.${prompt}
That building up high there is the Manustery's Cardian workshop. It's where those Cardian guards are manufacturrred.${prompt};Ce bâtiment là-haut est l'atelier Cardian du Manustery. C'est là que sont fabriqués ces gardes Cardian.${prompt}
Finally, heading west from the round will take you to Windurst's residential area.${prompt};Enfin, en partant vers l'ouest depuis le rond-point, vous arriverez à la zone résidentielle de Windurst.${prompt}
If you're a citizen of Windurst, you can use one of the Mog Houses inside of therrre.${prompt};Si vous êtes citoyen de Windurst, vous pouvez utiliser l'une des Maisons Mog à l'intérieur de là-bas.${prompt}
Ask the guards at the entrance there forrr the details.${prompt};Demandez aux gardes à l'entrée pour plus de détails.${prompt}
Why, hello there, adventurer.;Eh bien bonjour, aventurier.
I have a puzzling little problem you might be able to help me with...${prompt};J'ai un petit problème énigmatique que vous pourriez peut-être m'aider à résoudre...${prompt}
A while ago, I came into the possession of something called ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, which has given me the spooks.${prompt};Il y a quelque temps, je suis entré en possession de quelque chose appelé ${item-article:1[2]}, et cela m’a vraiment donné des sueurs froides.${prompt}
I've heard that its previous owners have all had the most bizarre things happen to them.${prompt};J’ai entendu dire que ses précédents propriétaires ont tous vécu les événements les plus bizarres.${prompt}
I've tried to get rid of the damned thing, but somehow it keeps making its way back to me. So...I was wondering if you can do something about this ribbon before I go quite crazy.${prompt};J’ai essayé de me débarrasser de ce fichu truc, mais il revient toujours vers moi. Alors... je me demandais si vous pouviez faire quelque chose à propos de ce ruban avant que je ne devienne complètement folle.${prompt}
Help Roberta with her ribbon?;Aider Roberta avec son ruban ?
${selection-lines};${selection-lines}
Accept.;Accepter.
Decline.${prompt};Refuser.${prompt}
Don't tell me you're too scared! Why, you looked like the type who could help an old lady.${prompt};Ne me dites pas que vous avez peur ! Vous aviez l'air du genre à pouvoir aider une vieille dame.${prompt}
I'm almost afraid to get you caught up in this business as well, but thank you for agreeing to help me out. Handle it with care, now...${prompt};J'ai presque peur de vous impliquer dans cette affaire, mais merci d'avoir accepté de m'aider. Manipulez-le avec précaution, maintenant...${prompt}
Why, hello again, adventurer. I still have that puzzling little problem you were supposed to be helping me out with...${prompt};Eh bien re-bonjour, aventurier. J'ai toujours ce petit problème énigmatique auquel vous étiez censé m'aider...${prompt}
Remember that ${item-singular: 1[2]} I gave you? Well, by any chance, did you happen to lose it?${prompt};Vous vous souvenez de ce ${item-singular:1[2]} que je vous ai donné ? Eh bien, par hasard, l’auriez-vous perdu ?${prompt}
Lost the ribbon?;Perdu le ruban ?
${selection-lines};${selection-lines}
Yes.;Oui.
No.${prompt};Non.${prompt}
I knew it! I knew it!;Je le savais ! Je le savais !
You won't believe this, but that ${item-singular: 1[2]} I gave you somehow made its way back to me again!${prompt};Vous ne me croirez jamais, mais ce ${item-singular:1[2]} que je vous ai donné est revenu vers moi encore une fois !${prompt}
Please. I beg you. Do something about this ribbon before it drives me crazy!${prompt};S'il vous plaît. Je vous en prie. Faites quelque chose à propos de ce ruban avant qu'il ne me rende folle !${prompt}
Really?;Vraiment ?
Hmm... No matter then...${prompt};Hmm... Peu importe alors...${prompt}
Hey ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Ma'am]...;Hé ${choice-player-gender}[Monsieur/Madame]...
Are you going to take me home...?${prompt};Allez-vous me ramener chez moi...?${prompt}
That ribbon is not for sale, and I certainly wouldn't buy it back from anyone. Yet, somehow it manages to come back here to me. What's going on...?${prompt};Ce ruban n'est pas à vendre, et je ne le rachèterais certainement pas à qui que ce soit. Pourtant, il parvient toujours à revenir ici vers moi. Que se passe-t-il... ?${prompt}
That ribbon is not for sale, and I certainly wouldn't buy it back from anyone. Yet, somehow it manages to come back here to me. What's going on...?${prompt};Ce ruban n'est pas à vendre, et je ne le rachèterais certainement pas à qui que ce soit. Pourtant, il parvient toujours à revenir ici vers moi. Que se passe-t-il... ?${prompt}
You don't have to tell me anything about the background of that ribbon. I don't want to know.${prompt};Vous n'avez pas besoin de me dire quoi que ce soit sur l'histoire de ce ruban. Je ne veux pas savoir.${prompt}
In this weird world of ours, some things are better left unknown.${prompt};Dans ce monde étrange qui est le nôtre, certaines choses sont mieux laissées inconnues.${prompt}
So...you've found me, huh? Yeah, I know, I know. Don't tell me--our editor, old Naiko-Paneiko, is all in a huff over wanting us to cough up our news scoops, rightaru?${prompt};Alors... vous m'avez trouvé, hein ? Oui, je sais, je sais. Ne me dites pas--notre éditeur, le vieux Naiko-Paneiko, est tout excité de vouloir que nous lâchions nos scoops d'information, n'est-ce pasaru ?${prompt}
Hmm... What should I do? You see, I have a great scoop, but haven't been able to confirm whether it is indeed true or notaru.${prompt};Hmm... Que devrais-je faire ? Vous voyez, j'ai un super scoop, mais je n'ai pas pu confirmer s'il est vraiment vrai ou nonaru.${prompt}
So I could let you just take it to him, but a good reporter should always double-check her sources, rightaru?${prompt};Alors je pourrais simplement vous laisser le prendre et le lui rapporter, mais une bonne reporter devrait toujours vérifier ses sources, n'est-ce pasaru ?${prompt}
Say, perhaps you could check my story out, and go see if the facts match up before you submitaru it to him? Maybe you could also get a few other adventurers to help you out and serve as witnesses...?${prompt};Dites, peut-être pourriez-vous vérifier mon histoire et aller voir si les faits concordent avant de le soumettre à notre éditeuraru ? Peut-être pourriez-vous aussi obtenir l'aide de quelques autres aventuriers pour vous aider et servir de témoins... ?${prompt}
To finish your job by confirming my news scoop, head into the depths of the eastern magic tower and find out whether the Cat Burglar's hideaway really does existaru there.${prompt};Pour terminer votre travail en confirmant mon scoop d'information, dirigez-vous vers les profondeurs de la tour de magie orientale et découvrez si le repaire du Voleur de Chats existe vraiment là-basaru.${prompt}
I don'taru suggest that you actually go inside her hideaway, as the Cat Burglar is bound to have dangerous traps and guards there. Just find the entrance to the place at the back of the Horutoto Ruins...then get the hell outta there!${prompt};Je ne vous suggère pas d'entrer réellement dans son repaire, car le Voleur de Chats est sûr d'avoir des pièges dangereux et des gardes là-bas. Trouvez simplement l'entrée du lieu à l'arrière des Ruines de Horutoto... puis sortez de là au plus vite !${prompt}
I knew it! My sources were correctaru! Race on back to my editor with the scoop before someone else beats us to it!${prompt};Je le savais ! Mes sources avaient raisonaru ! Filez vite voir mon éditeur avec le scoop avant que quelqu'un d'autre ne nous devance !${prompt}
This year's Pulitzer-Bulitzer Prize for journalism is in my pocket for sure! I'll make sure I thank you in my acceptance speech!${prompt};Le prix Pulitzer-Bulitzer de cette année pour le journalisme est dans ma poche, c'est sûr ! Je m'assurerai de vous remercier dans mon discours de remerciement !${prompt}
The Cat Burglar-wurglar...?;Le Voleur de Chats... ?
Oh, you mean Nanaa Mihgo?;Oh, vous voulez dire Nanaa Mihgo ?
Of course I know her!${prompt};Bien sûr que je la connais !${prompt}
They say the treasures she steals from people are never-ever found again. That's why the Mithra guardy-wardies can never arrest her...there's just no proof!${prompt};On dit que les trésors qu'elle vole aux gens ne sont jamais retrouvés. C'est pourquoi les gardes Mithra ne peuvent jamais l'arrêter... il n'y a tout simplement aucune preuve !${prompt}
As I thoughtaru!;Comme je le pensaisaru !
I won this year's Pulitzer-Bulitzer Prize for journalism with my scoop on the Cat Burglar!${prompt};J'ai remporté le Prix Pulitzer-Bulitzer cette année pour mon scoop sur le Voleur de Chats !${prompt}
And it's all thanks to you for helping confirm that it was true. I really want to thank you more, but will this do...?${prompt};Et tout ça grâce à vous pour avoir confirmé que c'était vrai. Je voulais vraiment vous remercier davantage, mais est-ce que cela suffira... ?${prompt}
I can'taru wait to see our next exclusive issue.${prompt};J'ai hâte de voir notre prochain numéro exclusif.${prompt}
My exposé will be the top story for sure. But I can'taru rest on my laurels. A good reporter has to keep following the truth, as no story ever really ends.${prompt};Mon exposé sera certainement en tête de l'actualité. Mais je ne peux pas me reposer sur mes lauriers. Un bon reporter doit continuer à suivre la vérité, car aucune histoire ne se termine jamais vraiment.${prompt}
Can't you see I'm busy now? Give a girl a little brrreathing room, huh?${prompt};Vous ne voyez pas que je suis occupée maintenant ? Laissez un peu de place à une fille, hein ?${prompt}
You did put the you-know-what into a metal box and sink it in the sea as we were told to, didn't you?${prompt};Vous avez bien mis le truc dans une boîte métallique et l'avez coulé dans la mer comme on vous l'a dit, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
You've got a cat's chance in hell of getting me to steal something like that again! Next time, you do the stealing, and I do the sinking, okay?${prompt};Vous avez une chance de chat en enfer de me faire voler quelque chose comme ça à nouveau ! La prochaine fois, c'est vous qui volez et moi qui coule, d'accord ?${prompt}
Oo～h... Aa～h... Ou～ch...!;Oo～h... Aa～h... Ai～e... !
I don't think our last burrrglary was such a good idea. The wounds where I was bitten by the you-know-what still ache, not to mention my back from carrying that heavy box I put it in.${prompt};Je ne pense pas que notre dernier cambriolage était une si bonne idée. Les blessures où j'ai été mordue par le truc me font toujours mal, sans parler de mon dos après avoir porté cette lourde boîte où je l'ai mis.${prompt}
What do you mean, my scoop exposé has been stolen!?${prompt};Comment ça, mon exposé scoop a été volé !?${prompt}
That dirty, rotten, low-down Cat Burglar! She's made a preemptive strike so as not to be caught outaru. This is a cat-astrophe!${prompt};Ce sale Voleur de Chats pourri et fourbe ! Elle a fait une attaque préventive pour ne pas se faire prendre, c'est une catastrophe !${prompt}
Looks like this week's edition of the Tarutaru Times's “Magic Paradise Weekly” is going to be canceled as well.${prompt};"Il semble que l'édition de cette semaine de ""Magic Paradise Weekly"" du Tarutaru Times va également être annulée.${prompt}"
If I said it once, I've said it a thousand times... We should give up on using those silly magic dolls to deliver our stories. and go back to the tried and true method of newspapers and magazines! Our stories always end up never getting told.${prompt};Si je l'ai dit une fois, je l'ai dit mille fois... Nous devrions abandonner l'utilisation de ces stupides poupées magiques pour transmettre nos histoires et revenir à la méthode éprouvée des journaux et des magazines ! Nos histoires finissent toujours par ne jamais être racontées.${prompt}
What...?;Quoi... ?
You've brought a Cardian that you want me to have a looky-wooky at?${prompt};Vous avez apporté un Cardian que vous voulez que je regarde ?${prompt}
I see...;Je vois...
Such a misfortunate episode has caused the poor thing to cease functioning.${prompt};Un épisode si malheureux a causé la cessation de fonctionnement de cette pauvre chose.${prompt}
The Mana Orb--the heart of this Cardian--is still glowing. This is not a mere case of magic energy depletion. This child's heart has been broken-woken.${prompt};L'Orbe de Mana - le cœur de ce Cardian - brille encore. Ce n'est pas juste un cas de déplétion d'énergie magique. Le cœur de cet enfant est brisé.${prompt}
Cardians are automaton dolls created with the help of magic, but their ability to perceive emotions is the same as us people.${prompt};Les Cardians sont des automates créés à l'aide de la magie, mais leur capacité à percevoir les émotions est similaire à celle des humains.${prompt}
Feelings are something transmitted between people as they gradually grow older. Cardians also develop by picking up many such feelings but, but...sometimes these feelings can even break them.${prompt};Les sentiments sont quelque chose qui se transmet entre les gens en grandissant progressivement. Les Cardians se développent aussi en captant beaucoup de ces sentiments mais... parfois ces sentiments peuvent même les briser.${prompt}
This Cardian you brought me was made during the war years, so it has probably felt its fair share of sorrow over its lifetime.${prompt};Ce Cardian que vous m'avez apporté a été fabriqué pendant les années de guerre, il a donc probablement ressenti sa juste part de chagrin au cours de sa vie.${prompt}
<Sigh>...;<Soupir>...
I wonder if I can heal the poor thingy-wingy?${prompt};Je me demande si je peux guérir cette pauvre petite chose.${prompt}
This is not one of the Cardians that I helped create. But...these poor children are still my responsibility...${prompt};Ce n'est pas l'un des Cardians que j'ai aidés à créer. Mais... ces pauvres enfants restent tout de même ma responsabilité...${prompt}
I'll... I'll try to re-enchant the magic back into it.${prompt};Je vais... je vais essayer de réenchanter la magie en lui.${prompt}
But I'll need help to carry it out. Would you be so good as to assist me?${prompt};Mais j'aurai besoin d'aide pour mener cela à bien. Seriez-vous assez aimable pour m'assister ?${prompt}
Help fix the Cardian?;Aider à réparer le Cardian ?
${selection-lines};${selection-lines}
Yes. Anything to help!;Oui. Tout pour aider !
Sorry, I can't.${prompt};Désolé, je ne peux pas.${prompt}
Thank you for your cooperation.;Merci pour votre coopération.
First, I'll need to remove my father's old magic. He was the previous Minister of the Manustery who created this Cardian.${prompt};Tout d'abord, je dois retirer la vieille magie de mon père. Il était l'ancien ministre du Manustère qui a créé ce Cardian.${prompt}
In order to do that, I'll need to pair it off with its opposing Cardian Card--the ten of cups. I only need a single ten of cups card, so could you be so good as to obtain one for me?${prompt};Pour cela, j'aurai besoin de l'associer avec sa carte opposée de Cardian - le dix de coupes. J'ai seulement besoin d'une seule carte de dix de coupes, pourriez-vous en obtenir une pour moi, s'il vous plaît ?${prompt}
Some of the old type of Cardians--who are now malfunctioning and breaking down--run wild in the southwestern parts of the Horutoto Ruins. That would be the best place to search. But please be very careful-wareful!${prompt};Certains des anciens types de Cardians - qui sont maintenant défectueux et en panne - errent dans les parties sud-ouest des Ruines de Horutoto. C'est là qu'il serait préférable de chercher. Mais soyez très prudent !${prompt}
That's too bady-wady...<sniff>${prompt};C'est bien dommage...<snif>${prompt}
The Ten of Cups is the opposing card to our poor little Cardian friendy-wiendy. If you bring me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, I can remove the old magic from him and commence my repairs.${prompt};Le Dix de Coupes est la carte opposée à notre pauvre ami Cardian. Si vous m’apportez ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, je pourrai retirer la vieille magie de lui et commencer mes réparations.${prompt}
Some of the old-style Cardians that have long malfunctioned run wild in the southwestern parts of the Horutoto Ruins of West Sarutabaruta. Try searching there. But please be very careful-wareful!${prompt};Certains des anciens Cardians de style ancien qui ont longtemps dysfonctionné errent dans les parties sud-ouest des Ruines de Horutoto dans l’ouest de Sarutabaruta. Essayez de chercher là-bas. Mais soyez très prudent !${prompt}
The magic that we use to breathe life into the automaton dollies can be very dangerousy if used incorrectly.${prompt};La magie que nous utilisons pour insuffler la vie aux automates peut être très dangereuse si elle est mal utilisée.${prompt}
It hasn't been as thoroughly researched or perfected as black or white magicy. Often its very use puts the caster herselfy in dangery.${prompt};Elle n'a pas été aussi bien étudiée ou perfectionnée que la magie noire ou blanche. Souvent, son utilisation met le lanceur lui-même en danger.${prompt}
Cardian Cards have the ability to dispel the magic that has been placed on Cardians...it's kind of like an emergency stop or self-destruct button.${prompt};Les Cartes Cardian ont la capacité de dissiper la magie qui a été placée sur les Cardians... c'est un peu comme un arrêt d'urgence ou un bouton d'autodestruction.${prompt}
Minister Apururu's father, the previous minister of our Manustery, could even remove magic without the use of Cards...but without him to show us, it's impossible for us to do it.${prompt};Le père du ministre Apururu, l'ancien ministre de notre Manustère, pouvait même retirer la magie sans utiliser de cartes... mais sans lui pour nous montrer, c'est impossible pour nous de le faire.${prompt}
There are many taboos when one breathes life into these automaton dolls, you know, kid?${prompt};Il y a beaucoup de tabous lorsqu'on insuffle la vie dans ces automates, vous savez, mon enfant ?${prompt}
One very important rule is to never cast a second batch of magic on a doll that already has magic placed on it. If you're not careful, either you or the doll could die! Shivers!${prompt};Une règle très importante est de ne jamais jeter un second sortilège sur une poupée qui en a déjà un. Si vous n'êtes pas prudent, vous ou la poupée pourriez mourir ! Frissons !${prompt}
Oh, goody-woody!;Oh, super !
You found it!${prompt};Vous l'avez trouvé !${prompt}
Now you can leave the rest to me. You can tell this child's friends back in Jeuno that it will be a little while longer before he's as good as new.${prompt};Maintenant, vous pouvez me laisser le reste. Vous pouvez dire aux amis de cet enfant à Jeuno qu'il faudra un peu plus de temps avant qu'il ne soit comme neuf.${prompt}
But...;Mais...
I need to wipe his Mana Orb clean in order to begin... I must clean away the memories that broke his heart...${prompt};J'ai besoin d'effacer son Orbe de Mana pour commencer... Je dois effacer les souvenirs qui ont brisé son cœur...${prompt}
Tell this child's friends back in Jeuno that it won't be much longer before he's as good as new.${prompt};Dites aux amis de cet enfant à Jeuno qu'il ne faudra pas beaucoup plus de temps avant qu'il ne soit comme neuf.${prompt}
I...;J'ai...
I need to wipe his Mana Orb clean in order to begin. I must clean away the memories that broke his heart...${prompt};J'ai besoin d'effacer son Orbe de Mana pour commencer. Je dois effacer les souvenirs qui ont brisé son cœur...${prompt}
Ooh, scary-warey!;Oh, c'est effrayant !
Don'ty you go disturbingy Minister Apururu now!${prompt};Ne dérangez pas le ministre Apururu maintenant !${prompt}
The magic needed to breathe lifey into a Cardian are all very delicate operationies. She has to keepy her concentration, she does!${prompt};La magie nécessaire pour insuffler la vie à un Cardian est une opération très délicate. Elle doit garder sa concentration, elle !${prompt}
The minister is so determined-wermined. I don'taru want her to go through with this, but it looks like nothing would stop her now.${prompt};Le ministre est si déterminée. Je ne veux pas qu'elle continue, mais il semble que rien ne l'arrêtera maintenant.${prompt}
She tends to get carried away when it comes to matters about her father. We have to look out for her as much as we can!${prompt};Elle a tendance à s'emporter quand il s'agit de questions concernant son père. Nous devons veiller sur elle autant que possible !${prompt}
There are many taboos when one breathes life into these automaton dolls, you know, kid?${prompt};Il y a beaucoup de tabous lorsqu'on insuffle la vie dans ces automates, vous savez, mon enfant ?${prompt}
One very important rule is to never cast a second batch of magic on a doll that already has magic placed on it. If you're not careful, either you or the doll could die! Shivers!${prompt};Une règle très importante est de ne jamais jeter un second sortilège sur une poupée qui en a déjà un. Si vous n'êtes pas prudent, vous ou la poupée pourriez mourir ! Frissons !${prompt}
Wot's that you sez? Give you back the book I borrrrowed from the library?${prompt};Quoi que tu dises ? Que je te rende le livre que j'ai emprunté à la bibliothèque ?${prompt}
Why, I always returrrn any books I borrow right on time, thank you! You sure you ain't got the wrong girrrl? Why would they think I've still got a book out?${prompt};Pourquoi, je rends toujours les livres que j'emprunte à temps, merci ! Vous êtes sûr que vous n'avez pas la mauvaise fille ? Pourquoi pensent-ils que j'ai encore un livre ?${prompt}
Yo～wl! Wot's that...?;Hé～hé ! Qu'est-ce...?
Do you think I'm the type to read a book like that? 'ow embarrrrassin'!${prompt};Tu crois que je suis le genre à lire un livre comme ça ? Quelle honte !${prompt}
You nincompoop!;Espèce de nigaud!
Never in all me life 'as anyone even suggested I'd borrrrow an embarrassin' book like ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}!${prompt};Jamais de ma vie on m'a suggéré d'emprunter un livre embarrassant comme ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} !${prompt}
It's not just obstruction of business, why, it's violatin' me rights, that's what it is! Get the 'ell outta 'ere before I scrrratch ya eyes out!${prompt};Ce n'est pas seulement une obstruction aux affaires, mais vous violez mes droits, voilà ce que c'est ! Déguerpissez avant que je vous arrache les yeux !${prompt}
Woowee...!;Wouah là là...!
We overhearrrd you! Seems our boss has a darrring side to her after all!♪${prompt};On vous a entendu! Il semblerait que notre patronne ait un côté audacieux après tout !♪${prompt}
Woow-woo! You go, girl!;Wouah, super! Allez-y, patronne!
Looks like our boss's sprrring has come at last! She doesn't have to deny it so much. Being a closet rrromantic is nothing to be ashamed of...${prompt};On dirait que notre patronne est enfin décidée ! Elle n'a pas besoin de le nier autant. Être une romantique cachée, ce n'est pas quelque chose dont on devrait avoir honte...${prompt}
Hae Jakhya!?;Hae Jakhya !?
Now you mention it, that is exactly like my name, ain't it?${prompt};Maintenant que vous le mentionnez, c'est exactement comme mon nom, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Yowl! But 'ow the 'ell could someone mix up a girrrly princess kitten like 'er with a rough and tough lioness like me! That's just not on!${prompt};Youhou ! Mais comment quelqu'un pourrait-il confondre une petite princesse-chatte comme elle avec une lionne rude et dure comme moi ! C'est impensable !${prompt}
But, anyways, I'm glad that little matta is overrr! Quite relieved!${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit, je suis soulagée que cette petite affaire soit terminée !${prompt}
So it was just anotherrr Mithra who has a similarrr name to our boss, Hae Jakkya, who borrowed the saucy romance novel... Well, that was a letdown!${prompt};Alors c'était juste une autre Mithra qui a un nom similaire à notre patronne, Hae Jakkya, qui a emprunté le roman romantique... Eh bien, quelle déception !${prompt}
What a borrring outcome.${prompt};Quel résultat ennuyeux.${prompt}
The overdue book was called ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, was it? Hmm...${prompt};Le livre en retard s’appelait ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, n’est-ce pas ? Hmm...${prompt}
Oh...?;Oh... ?
Not that I'd have any rrreal interest in such a thing!${prompt};Pas que j'aie un véritable intérêt pour une telle chose !${prompt}
Tehehe... I keep going out into East Sarutabaruta, hunt a whole lot of Mandragora, collect their four-leaf buds, then come back and sell them off here to make a killing-willing! I'm so richy-wichy now!♪${prompt};Tehehe... Je vais à l’est de Sarutabaruta, je chasse beaucoup de Mandragora, je collectionne leurs bourgeons à quatre feuilles, puis je reviens ici pour les vendre et faire une petite fortune ! Je suis super riche maintenant !♪${prompt}
Once I've saved up enough gil, I'm heading off to the shops on the docks of the port area. Any respectable black mage should at least equip herself with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, don'taru think?${prompt};Une fois que j’aurai économisé suffisamment de gils, je me rendrai dans les magasins du port. Tout mage noir respectable devrait au moins s’équiper de ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ne pensez-vous pas ?${prompt}
The Cat Burglar-wurglar...?;Le Voleur de Chats-wat ?
Oh, you mean Nanaa Mihgo!;Oh, vous voulez dire Nanaa Mihgo !
Of course I know her!${prompt};Bien sûr que je la connais !${prompt}
She gets angry-wangry all of a sudden, so she can be kind of scary at times, but she knows a lot of interesting story-wories.${prompt};Elle se met en colère tout d'un coup, donc elle peut être un peu effrayante par moments, mais elle connaît beaucoup d'histoires intéressantes.${prompt}
Elvaan are all so high and haughty. It almost seems like they look down on us Tarutaru at times.${prompt};Les Elvaan sont si arrogants. On dirait parfois qu'ils nous regardent de haut, nous les Tarutaru.${prompt}
Huh...?;Hein... ?
How dare you say that's because we are so short that everyone can't help but look down on us! Beat it before I bite your kneecaps!${prompt};Comment osez-vous dire que c'est parce que nous sommes si petits que tout le monde ne peut s'empêcher de nous regarder de haut ! Dégagez avant que je vous morde les genoux !${prompt}
Magical energy is strong all around the vicinities of Windurst, so magical plants thrive here!${prompt};L'énergie magique est forte tout autour des environs de Windurst, c'est pourquoi les plantes magiques prospèrent ici !${prompt}
The apothecary down the way combines her Mithran skills with the local flora to create all sorts of new medicinal products.${prompt};L'apothicaire là-bas combine ses compétences Mithra avec la flore locale pour créer toutes sortes de nouveaux produits médicinaux.${prompt}
Hmm...there's gotaru be some interesting stories floating around somewhere. Hey, you there, ${choice-player-gender}[mister/missy]...have you heard any juicy tidbits of information lately?${prompt};Hmm... il doit y avoir quelques histoires intéressantes qui traînent quelque part. Hé, vous là-bas, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/mademoiselle]... avez-vous entendu des ragots croustillants récemment ?${prompt}
I was expecting there to be a fuss among the Mithra over who assumes the chieftainness's throne, but nah... I guess good stories don'taru come that easy.${prompt};Je m'attendais à ce qu'il y ait de l'agitation parmi les Mithra pour savoir qui va occuper le trône de la cheffesse, mais non... Je suppose que les bonnes histoires ne viennent pas si facilement.${prompt}
We Mithra are often called the “people of the woods” because we originally lived in forrrests.${prompt};"Nous, les Mithra, sommes souvent appelés les ""gens des bois"" parce que nous vivions initialement dans des forêts.${prompt}"
Well, due to varrrious circumstances, we came to live in Windurst. This is a nice place, although I don't think we'll ever come to underrrstand the Tarutaru ways...but they aren't bad people at hearrrt.${prompt};Eh bien, en raison de diverses circonstances, nous sommes venus vivre à Windurst. C'est un bel endroit, même si je ne pense pas que nous comprendrons jamais les coutumes des Tarutaru... mais ce ne sont pas des gens mauvais au fond.${prompt}
It is trrrue that the Mithra of Windurst obey the Star Sibyl...${prompt};Il est vrai que les Mithra de Windurst obéissent à la Sybille des Étoiles...${prompt}
...But that's only because our chieftainness, Perih Vashai, is doing so herrrself.${prompt};...Mais c’est seulement parce que notre cheffesse, Perih Vashai, le fait elle-même.${prompt}
Whenever you look around Windurst Woods you see Mithra, rrright? But just until a few decades ago, this whole arrrea was full of Tarutaru.${prompt};Chaque fois que vous regardez autour du Bois de Windurst, vous voyez des Mithra, n'est-ce pas ? Mais il y a seulement quelques décennies, toute cette région était peuplée de Tarutaru.${prompt}
That was until the warrr years when the Mithran chieftainness, Perih Vashai, came across the seas from the Mithran homeland with her arrrmy of fighters.${prompt};C'était jusqu'aux années de guerre lorsque la cheffesse Mithra, Perih Vashai, est venue de l'ancienne patrie Mithra avec son armée de combattants.${prompt}
Have you seen those automaton guarrrds called Cardians? They are made at the Manustery, herrre in Windurst Woods.${prompt};Avez-vous vu ces gardes automates appelés Cardians ? Ils sont fabriqués à la Manustérie, ici même dans le Bois de Windurst.${prompt}
The Manustery is famous for being the poorrrest of Windurst's five ministries of magic.${prompt};La Manustérie est célèbre pour être la plus modeste des cinq ministères magiques de Windurst.${prompt}
Those automaton guards they call Cardians are said to grrrow smarter and smarter by the day as they learrrn more and more.${prompt};On dit que ces gardes automates appelés Cardians deviennent de plus en plus intelligents chaque jour qu'ils apprennent.${prompt}
It's only a matter of time until they all start developing their own perrrsonalities and then begin to fight among themselves. Won't that be fun?${prompt};Ce n'est qu'une question de temps avant qu'ils ne commencent tous à développer leur propre personnalité et ne commencent à se battre entre eux. Ça ne sera pas amusant ?${prompt}
How's it goin', mate?;Comment ça va, mon pote ?
Enjoyin' a spot of adventurrrin', I see...${prompt};Vous profitez d'une petite aventure, je vois...${prompt}
Life's long, and you can put off till tommora what you don't wanta do today. So don't you be wearin' yourself out with all that adventurrrin', you hear?${prompt};La vie est longue, et vous pouvez remettre à demain ce que vous ne voulez pas faire aujourd'hui. Alors ne vous épuisez pas trop avec toutes ces aventures, vous m'entendez ?${prompt}
It's that very attitude that's stoppin' you from ever findin' the old pirate king's treasure, y'know-wow!?${prompt};C'est cette attitude qui vous empêche de trouver le trésor du vieux roi pirate, vous savez-wow !?${prompt}
C'mon, we've gotta getta move on, Gottah! Hurry up and buy that armor you've been wantin' at the port-wort so we can go out and level up some more-wore!${prompt};Allez, on doit se bouger, Gottah ! Dépêchez-vous d'acheter cette armure que vous vouliez au port-wort pour que nous puissions sortir et monter de niveau encore plus-wore !${prompt}
The firrrst rrrule of the Starrr Onion Brrrigade...!${prompt};La première règle de la Brigade Étoile des Oignons... !${prompt}
Show kindness to any stupid-looking adventurrrerrrs you meet!${prompt};Soyez gentil avec tous les aventuriers à l'air stupide que vous rencontrez !${prompt}
It's firrrst come, firrrst serrrved when it comes to the items put on auction. You'rrre competing in bidding against people frrrom all overrr the worrrld, so don't hesitate if you'rrre not surrre. Just do it!${prompt};C'est premier arrivé, premier servi quand il s'agit des objets mis aux enchères. Vous êtes en concurrence dans les enchères avec des gens du monde entier, donc n'hésitez pas si vous n'êtes pas sûr. Faites-le juste !${prompt}
I'm starrrving!;J'ai faim !
I'm so hungrrry I could eat a...;J'ai tellement faim que je pourrais manger un...
Hey...can you eat chocobos?;Hé... est-ce qu'on peut manger des chocobos ?
I bet they taste like chicken!${prompt};Je parie qu'ils ont le goût du poulet !${prompt}
Perih Vashai is a Mithran heroine who rrrendered great service during the war twenty years ago.${prompt};Perih Vashai est une héroïne Mithra qui a rendu de grands services pendant la guerre il y a vingt ans.${prompt}
She lost a great many things back then, but never did she lose her pride or break her pledge. It just goes to show that physical strength is not the sole rrrequisite to be a hero.${prompt};Elle a perdu beaucoup de choses à l'époque, mais jamais elle n'a perdu sa fierté ni rompu son serment. Cela montre bien que la force physique n'est pas le seul prérequis pour être un héros.${prompt}
Our chieftainness is verrry old...;Notre cheffesse est très âgée...
It seems that she wants to pass the chieftainness's bow onto the Sibyl Guard Semih Lafihna.${prompt};Il semble qu'elle veuille transmettre son titre à Semih Lafihna, de la Garde Sibylline.${prompt}
But I doubt if Semih Lafihna would accept that honorable responsibility. Quite a prrredicament we're in, eh?${prompt};Mais je doute que Semih Lafihna accepterait cette honorable responsabilité. Nous sommes vraiment dans une sacrée situation, hein ?${prompt}
I don't think we've achieved any rrreal peace by making a pact with those Yagudo beastmen!${prompt};Je ne pense pas que nous ayons réellement obtenu la paix en faisant un pacte avec ces homme-bêtes Yagudo!${prompt}
But try explaining that to the Tarutaru, and they'll just be all stubborrrn and insist that it's the Star Sibyl's will!${prompt};Mais essayez d'expliquer cela aux Tarutaru, et ils seront simplement têtus et insisteront que c'est la volonté de la Sybille des Étoiles!${prompt}
It's purrr-etty darn hard to catch a dhalmel, you know? Only we Mithra have the necessary abilities to do it propurrrly!${prompt};Attraper un dhalmel, c'est sacrément dur, vous savez ? Seules les Mithra ont les compétences nécessaires pour le faire correctement !${prompt}
To carry out that ability, you need something in purrrticular. To give you a hint, it's something that only Mithra have... Purrr...${prompt};Pour accomplir cette compétence, vous avez besoin de quelque chose de particulier. Pour vous donner un indice, c'est quelque chose que seules les Mithra ont... Purrr...${prompt}
The centrrral hub of Windurst is the Windurst Walls distrrrict, with Heavens Tower encompassed by that overgrrrown star tree. You'll get there if you head north strrraight along this path.${prompt};Le centre névralgique de Windurst est le district des Murailles de Windurst, avec la Tour des Cieux entourée de cet arbre étoilé surdimensionné. Vous y arriverez si vous suivez cette route tout droit vers le nord.${prompt}
But it's too quiet there, with too many brrridges for my liking. I don't find it the least bit interrresting.${prompt};Mais c'est trop calme là-bas, avec trop de ponts à mon goût. Ça ne m'intéresse pas le moins du monde.${prompt}
You know about that mad hatter in the Tarutaru district of Windurst Waters, rrright?${prompt};Vous connaissez ce chapelier fou dans le quartier Tarutaru des Eaux de Windurst, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Well, those Tarutaru have nothing on us Mithra in Windurst Woods! Why, we have our own mad apothecary herrre!${prompt};Eh bien, ces Tarutaru n'ont rien à nous envier, les Mithra du Bois de Windurst ! Nous avons notre propre folle apothicaire ici !${prompt}
Hey... How come all the otherrr Mithrrra speak so badly of the Captain of the Sibyl Guarrrds from Heavens Towerrr? She is so strrrong and so cool-looking! Hey... Is she going to be ourrr next trrribal leaderrr?${prompt};Hé... Pourquoi est-ce que tous les autres Mithra parlent si mal de la Capitaine de la Garde Sibylline de la Tour des Cieux ? Elle est si forte et si classe ! Hé... Est-ce qu'elle va être notre prochain leader tribal ?${prompt}
Windurst Woods is famous for its dhalmel farm up the rrroad there. You've just got to check it out!${prompt};Le Bois de Windurst est célèbre pour sa ferme de dhalmel là-haut sur la route. Vous devez absolument y jeter un œil !${prompt}
The cheese made from dhalmel's milk is an acquirrred taste, but once you come to appreciate it, you just can't stop eating the stuff!${prompt};Le fromage fait avec le lait de dhalmel est un goût acquis, mais une fois que vous commencez à l'apprécier, vous ne pouvez plus vous arrêter d'en manger !${prompt}
Where did I drop it?;Où est-ce que je l'ai laissé tomber?
Damn, that's going to be impossible to find, too! What a catastrophe...!${prompt};Zut, ça va être impossible à retrouver aussi! Quelle catastrophe... !${prompt}
I heard that this was a land with strange animated dolls used as guards, but this surpassed all expectations.${prompt};J'ai entendu dire que c'était un pays avec d'étranges poupées animées utilisées comme gardes, mais cela dépasse toutes les attentes.${prompt}
They say they make these magic dolls in a place called the Manustery. If I were to visit there, I wonder if they would permit me to go a round with one of those ungodly contraptions...${prompt};On dit qu'ils fabriquent ces poupées magiques en un endroit appelé la Manustérie. Si je devais visiter là-bas, je me demande s'ils me permettraient de faire un tour avec une de ces abominations...${prompt}
Ha-ha...;Ha-ha...
Now I get it!${prompt};Maintenant, j'ai compris !${prompt}
It's against the rules to ride a chocobo into the town. So that's why those strange automaton Cardian guard things chased me around and around like that!${prompt};Il est interdit de monter à chocobo dans la ville. C'est pourquoi ces étranges automates gardiens Cardian m'ont pourchassé autour et autour comme ça !${prompt}
Phew-wee...;Ouf...
I came all the way over here in search of hints for a new kind of business, but I can't believe my eyes!${prompt};Je suis venu jusqu'ici à la recherche d'indices pour un nouveau type de commerce, mais je n'en crois pas mes yeux !${prompt}
What in Vana'diel are those long-necked animals they have here? Are these also creations conjured up with Tarutaru magic?${prompt};Qu'est-ce que sont ces animaux au long cou qu'ils ont ici à Vana'diel ? Sont-ils aussi des créations conjurées avec la magie Tarutaru ?${prompt}
Wee... We're now waltzing in Windurst Woods.;Wee... Nous valsant maintenant dans les Bois de Windurst.
Whoa! Want to whirl over to Windurst Waters? Then let me move you in a moment with my mighty magic, maybe?${prompt};Whoa ! Vous voulez tourbillonner jusqu'aux Eaux de Windurst? Alors laissez-moi vous y transporter en un instant avec ma magie puissante, peut-être ?${prompt}

<pant> I am but a poor;<pant> Je suis juste un pauvre
merchant. Mate, but you just wait!;commerçant. Mon pote, mais attends !
Strife...one day I'll live the high life.;Des luttes... un jour je vivrai la grande vie.
Hey, that's my dream, anyway...${prompt};Eh bien, c'est mon rêve, en tout cas...${prompt}
Yes. This is the consulate of San d'Oria. How may I be of service?${prompt};Oui. C'est le consulat de San d'Oria. Comment puis-je vous aider ?${prompt}
I see... You have no business with me. Sorry, but I have work I must return to, so please allow me to continue with it. Good day.${prompt};Je vois... Vous n'avez pas affaire à moi. Désolé, mais j'ai du travail auquel je dois retourner, alors veuillez me permettre de continuer. Bonne journée.${prompt}
If I may, allow me to tell you a little about San d'Oria...${prompt};Si je peux me permettre, permettez-moi de vous parler un peu de San d'Oria...${prompt}
San d'Oria is a land of the sword and of great faith. It is famous for its gallant Royal Knights and loyal Temple Knights, its grand regal chateau, and its glorious cathedral.${prompt};San d'Oria est une terre de l'épée et de grande foi. Elle est célèbre pour ses courageux chevaliers royaux et ses loyaux chevaliers du temple, son grand château royal et sa glorieuse cathédrale.${prompt}
The hymns sung in the cathedral are particularly divine. Even the stoniest of hearts cannot help but be moved by them.${prompt};Les hymnes chantés dans la cathédrale sont particulièrement divins. Même les cœurs les plus endurcis ne peuvent s'empêcher d'être émus par eux.${prompt}
It is rather impossible to say that the Windurstian government is the most logical system. However, the Tarutaru believe in their Star Sibyl and maintain strong bonds with each other.${prompt};Il est plutôt impossible de dire que le gouvernement de Windurst est le système le plus logique. Cependant, les Tarutarus croient en leur Sybille des étoiles et entretiennent des liens solides les uns avec les autres.${prompt}
And is it not the faith and the bonds of its citizens that make a country strong? Only when the hearts of the individuals are unified can a government really work.${prompt};Et n'est-ce pas la foi et les liens de ses citoyens qui rendent un pays fort ? Ce n'est que lorsque les cœurs des individus sont unifiés qu'un gouvernement peut vraiment fonctionner.${prompt}
This is the consulate of San d'Oria.;C'est le consulat de San d'Oria.
Our role is to serve and protect the citizens of San d'Oria residing in Windurst.${prompt};Notre rôle est de servir et de protéger les citoyens de San d'Oria résidant à Windurst.${prompt}
But of course, we shan't forsake non-San d'Orian citizens who require our assistance. For we San d'Orians are indeed a just people.${prompt};Mais bien sûr, nous n'abandonnerons pas les citoyens non San d'Oriens qui ont besoin de notre aide. Car nous, les San d'Oriens, sommes en effet un peuple juste.${prompt}
The light shines where there is righteousness, so do not be afraid, citizen of ${choice: 1}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]. The soldiers of San d'Oria only unsheathe their swords in the name of justice.${prompt};La lumière brille là où il y a la droiture, alors ne craignez pas, citoyen de ${choice: 1}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]. Les soldats de San d’Oria ne dégaineront leur épée que au nom de la justice.${prompt}
The light shines only where there is righteousness. Fellow citizen of San d'Oria, never lose the pride you have in your country.${prompt};La lumière ne brille que là où il y a la droiture. Compatriote de San d'Oria, ne perdez jamais la fierté que vous avez envers votre pays.${prompt}
Welcome to the consulate of San d'Oria.;Bienvenue au consulat de San d'Oria.
If you wish to speak to Consul Mourices, enter his office through the door on your right.${prompt};Si vous souhaitez parler au consul Mourices, entrez dans son bureau par la porte à votre droite.${prompt}
So you've come all the way from San d'Oria, eh? Your dedication to serving the motherland is most admirable.${prompt};Ah, vous êtes venu tout droit de San d'Oria, n'est-ce pas ? Votre dévouement envers la patrie est des plus admirables.${prompt}
Unfortunately, I am in one of my moods today. After I read the mission request from Windurst, I became most disgusted.${prompt};Malheureusement, je suis d'humeur massacrante aujourd'hui. Après avoir lu la demande de mission de Windurst, j'ai été profondément dégoûté.${prompt}
Forine, please explain to the ${choice-player-gender}[brave man/nice lady] here what the mission entails.${prompt};Forine, veuillez expliquer à ${choice-player-gender}[ce brave homme/cette charmante dame] ici présente en quoi consiste la mission.${prompt}
Yes, Consul.;Oui, Consul.
Allow me to explain...${prompt};Permettez-moi d'expliquer...${prompt}
The mission from the Windurstian government entails the oblation of magic armor to Giddeus, the frontline to the abode of the Yagudo beastmen.${prompt};La mission du gouvernement de Windurst consiste à offrir une armure magique à Giddeus, le premier rempart de l'antre des Yagudo beastmen.${prompt}
A magic shield will be handed to you at Heavens Tower in Windurst Walls. Your orders are to deliver it to the Yagudo treasure chamber, deep in the underground of Giddeus.${prompt};Un bouclier magique vous sera remis à la tour des Cieux dans les murailles de Windurst. Votre mission est de le livrer dans la chambre aux trésors des Yagudo, profondément enfouie sous terre à Giddeus.${prompt}
Have you had the misfortune of meeting the Yagudo yet? They have made a nasty practice out of ganging up to attack the travelers who pass through Sarutabaruta...${prompt};Avez-vous eu la malchance de rencontrer les Yagudo ? Ils ont pris l'habitude détestable d'attaquer les voyageurs qui traversent Sarutabaruta en bande...${prompt}
These are the same beastmen who sided with “the Kindred” twenty years ago, and killed many of our comrades in the war.${prompt};"Ce sont les mêmes beastmen qui se sont rangés du côté de ""l'Alliance"" il y a vingt ans, et ont tué bon nombre de nos camarades lors de la guerre.${prompt}"
However, the Windurstians have grown too complacent and show their love of pacifism--even if it is nothing more than a one-sided façade--by forming amicable relations with the Yagudo beastmen.${prompt};Cependant, les Windurstiens sont devenus trop complaisants et montrent leur amour de la pacifisme - même si ce n'est rien de plus qu'une façade unilatérale - en nouant des relations amicales avec les Yagudo beastmen.${prompt}
And now they dare ask us proud San d'Orians to carry a tribute to a pack of beastmen. It would almost be laughable if it wasn't such a slap in the face.${prompt};Et maintenant, ils osent demander à nous, fiers San d'Oriens, de porter un tribut à une bande de beastmen. C'en serait presque risible si ce n'était pas un tel affront.${prompt}
However, this mission has to be accomplished as part of our pledge to Windurst. We Elvaan are not ones to break our promises, are we?${prompt};Cependant, cette mission doit être accomplie dans le cadre de notre engagement envers Windurst. Nous, les Elvaan, ne sommes pas du genre à rompre nos promesses, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
And yet, at the same time, as San d'Orians, we cannot allow this injustice to go unchecked.${prompt};Et pourtant, en tant que San d'Oriens, nous ne pouvons permettre que cette injustice reste impunie.${prompt}
The situation is most exasperating. However, I must command you to go and give the Yagudo their magic shield. But at the same time, I entreat you to deprive the other Yagudo you meet along the way of two of their shields, making up for the imbalance.${prompt};La situation est des plus exaspérantes. Cependant, je dois vous ordonner de partir et de donner le bouclier magique aux Yagudo. Mais en même temps, je vous supplie de priver les autres Yagudo que vous rencontrerez en chemin de deux de leurs boucliers, afin de compenser le déséquilibre.${prompt}
Now, off with you!${prompt};Allez, en avant !${prompt}
However exasperating the situation, I must command you to go give the Yagudo their magic shield. At the same time, I entreat you to deprive the Yagudo you meet along the way twice the number of the shields to make up for the imbalance.${prompt};Aussi exaspérante que soit la situation, je dois vous ordonner d'aller donner le bouclier magique aux Yagudo. En même temps, je vous en supplie, privés les Yagudo que vous rencontrerez en chemin du double du nombre de boucliers pour compenser le déséquilibre.${prompt}
No Elvaan would ever do something as dishonorable as breaking a promise to another.${prompt};Aucun Elvaan ne ferait quelque chose d'aussi déshonorant que de rompre une promesse envers un autre.${prompt}
Your orders are to proceed to Heavens Tower in Windurst Walls, where a magic shield will be handed to you.${prompt};Votre mission est de vous rendre à la tour des Cieux dans les murailles de Windurst, où un bouclier magique vous sera remis.${prompt}
In order to accomplish this mission as assigned by Windurst, you are to deliver the shield to the Yagudo treasure chamber, deep underground in Giddeus. However, that is not all...${prompt};Afin d'accomplir cette mission telle que l'a assignée Windurst, vous devez livrer le bouclier à la chambre aux trésors des Yagudo, profondément sous terre à Giddeus. Mais ce n'est pas tout...${prompt}
While we cannot break our promise to the Windurstians, to ensure justice is served, we would secretly like you to take two shields off of the Yagudo who you meet en route.${prompt};Bien que nous ne puissions rompre notre promesse envers les Windurstiens, pour assurer que la justice soit rendue, nous aimerions secrètement que vous preniez deux boucliers aux Yagudo que vous rencontrerez en chemin.${prompt}
Act according to our convictions while fulfilling our promise with the Tarutaru. This is indeed a fitting course for us, the people of glorious San d'Oria.${prompt};Agissez selon nos convictions tout en remplissant notre promesse envers les Tarutaru. C'est en effet une voie appropriée pour nous, le peuple de la glorieuse San d'Oria.${prompt}
Fool!;Imbécile !
Did you not hear our orders correctly? Or are you just out to start a war?${prompt};N'avez-vous pas entendu correctement nos ordres ? Ou cherchez-vous simplement à déclencher une guerre ?${prompt}
Can you not remember the most important part of the mission? You had to deliver a magic shield to the Yagudo treasure chamber. And you call yourself a San d'Orian!?${prompt};Ne pouvez-vous pas vous retourer la partie la plus importante de la mission ? Vous deviez livrer un bouclier magique à la chambre aux trésors des Yagudo. Et vous vous appelez San d'Orien !?${prompt}
Fool!${prompt};Imbécile !${prompt}
You only handed over Windurst's magic shield to the Yagudo and skipped back, leaving the balance of power skewed. Such action would be considered treason back in San d'Oria!!!${prompt};Vous avez seulement remis le bouclier magique de Windurst aux Yagudo et êtes parti en courant, laissant l'équilibre du pouvoir biaisé. Une telle action serait considérée comme une trahison à San d'Oria !!!${prompt}
Humph. Seems as if you were able to maintain the path of righteousness.${prompt};Humph. Il semble que vous ayez su maintenir le chemin de la droiture.${prompt}
You are now to head to the Consulate of San d'Oria in Bastok.${prompt};Vous devez maintenant vous rendre au consulat de San d'Oria à Bastok.${prompt}
Do you know the way to Bastok from here? You can travel by sea from Mhaura back to Selbina. From there, you have to cross the highlands to the south.${prompt};Savez-vous comment vous rendre à Bastok à partir d'ici ? Vous pouvez voyager par mer depuis Mhaura jusqu'à Selbina. De là, vous devez traverser les hautes terres vers le sud.${prompt}
Glory to the Kingdom of San d'Oria.;Gloire au Royaume de San d'Oria.
Farewell and safe passage.${prompt};Adieu et bon voyage.${prompt}
Head to the Consulate of San d'Oria in Bastok.${prompt};Dirigez-vous vers le Consulat de San d'Oria à Bastok.${prompt}
The best way to journey to Bastok from here is to ride a ship from Mhaura back to Selbina. From there, you have to cross the highlands to the south.${prompt};Le meilleur moyen de se rendre à Bastok d'ici est de prendre un navire de Mhaura à Selbina. De là, vous devez traverser les hautes terres vers le sud.${prompt}
The Republic of Bastok is occupied by two races, the Hume and the Galka, who are the exact antithesis of each other.${prompt};La République de Bastok est occupée par deux races, les Humes et les Galkas, qui sont exactement l'antithèse l'une de l'autre.${prompt}
Occasionally they break out into fights, so it is imperative that you maintain neutrality as you assess the situation and then avail yourself to the righteous ones.${prompt};Parfois, ils se battent, il est donc impératif que vous mainteniez la neutralité pendant que vous évaluez la situation, puis vous joignez aux justes.${prompt}
Now that you have completed that little mission of amity, you are just an ordinary San d'Orian citizen again. So that frees you to go to Giddeus and really give those beastmen what they deserve.${prompt};Maintenant que vous avez accompli cette petite mission d'amitié, vous êtes de nouveau un simple citoyen de San d'Oria. Vous êtes donc libre d'aller à Giddeus et de vraiment donner à ces bêtes ce qu'elles méritent.${prompt}
However, we shan't take responsibility if you get seriously hurt in the process.${prompt};Cependant, nous ne prendrons pas la responsabilité si vous êtes sérieusement blessé dans le processus.${prompt}
Your efforts are well noted. Take care on your journey to Bastok.${prompt};Vos efforts sont bien notés. Prenez soin de votre voyage à Bastok.${prompt}
So you've come all the way from San d'Oria, eh? Your dedication to serving the motherland is most admirable.${prompt};Donc, vous êtes venu tout le chemin depuis San d'Oria, hein ? Votre dévouement au service de la mère patrie est des plus admirables.${prompt}
This mission on the behalf of the Windurstian government displays our country's level of friendship towards Windurst.${prompt};Cette mission au nom du gouvernement de Windurst témoigne du niveau d'amitié de notre pays envers Windurst.${prompt}
Forine, please explain to the ${choice-player-gender}[brave man/nice lady] here what the mission entails.${prompt};Forine, veuillez expliquer à ce ${choice-player-gender}[brave homme/gentille dame] ici ce que la mission implique.${prompt}
Yes, Consul.;Oui, Consul.
Allow me to explain Windurst's request...${prompt};Permettez-moi d'expliquer la demande de Windurst...${prompt}
A giant monster has appeared in the depths of Giddeus, the borderland to the theocracy of the Yagudo beastmen. The Windurstian government wants it exterminated.${prompt};Un monstre géant est apparu dans les profondeurs de Giddeus, le territoire frontalier du théocratie des Yagudos. Le gouvernement de Windurst veut l'exterminer.${prompt}
You are to receive a key from Heavens Tower in the Windurst Walls district and head to the innermost part of Giddeus, where the creature awaits.${prompt};Vous devez recevoir une clé de la Tour des Cieux dans le quartier des Murs de Windurst et vous diriger vers la partie la plus profonde de Giddeus, où la créature vous attend.${prompt}
Ha-ha! What a jolly tale that is. A ferocious monster appearing in the heart of Giddeus, scaring the Yagudo so much they ask Tarutaru to help them?${prompt};Ha-ha ! Quelle histoire joyeuse. Un monstre féroce apparaissant au cœur de Giddeus, effrayant tellement les Yagudos qu'ils demandent aux Tarutarus de les aider ?${prompt}
It's most fortunate for those beastmen that the Windurst government had sought amicable relations with them in order to maintain the peace of their country.${prompt};C'est très chanceux pour ces bêtes que le gouvernement de Windurst ait cherché des relations amicales avec eux afin de maintenir la paix de leur pays.${prompt}
What? Don't tell me you hadn't heard of Windurst's little peace pact with the Yagudo?${prompt};Quoi ? Ne me dites pas que vous n'avez pas entendu parler du petit pacte de paix de Windurst avec les Yagudos ?${prompt}
Of course, we San d'Orians have no need to show to those vulgar beastmen any courtesy whatsoever, but this is an agreement between our two countries, so we have no choice but to go through with it.${prompt};Bien sûr, nous, San d'Oriens, n'avons aucun besoin de montrer à ces vulgaires bêtes aucune courtoisie, mais c'est un accord entre nos deux pays, donc nous n'avons d'autre choix que de le respecter.${prompt}
So go ahead and exterminate the ferocious monster plaguing the depths of Giddeus, but don't think you have to hold back from also giving those whining beastmen what they deserve.${prompt};Allez donc exterminer le monstre féroce qui sévit dans les profondeurs de Giddeus, mais ne pensez pas que vous devez vous retenir de donner également à ces Yagudos pleurnicheurs ce qu'ils méritent.${prompt}
Anyway, enough chatter.;Quoi qu'il en soit, assez de bavardages.
Godspeed on your assignment.${prompt};Bonne chance dans votre mission.${prompt}
Go and exterminate the ferocious monster plaguing the depths of Giddeus, but don't hold back from also giving those whining beastmen what they deserve.${prompt};Allez et exterminiez le monstre féroce qui sévit dans les profondeurs de Giddeus, mais ne vous retenez pas de donner également à ces Yagudos pleurnicheurs ce qu'ils méritent.${prompt}
To access the innermost part of Giddeus, you must receive the key from Heavens Tower in the Windurst Walls district.${prompt};Pour accéder à la partie la plus profonde de Giddeus, vous devez recevoir la clé de la Tour des Cieux dans le quartier des Murs de Windurst.${prompt}
Report back here once you have defeated the ferocious monster that is menacing the Yagudo in the depths of Giddeus.${prompt};Revenez ici une fois que vous avez vaincu le monstre féroce qui menace les Yagudos dans les profondeurs de Giddeus.${prompt}
I would not try to deny the Tarutaru of this land from pursuing peace. It is just that I desire lasting peace, not the temporary façade that Windurst has now.${prompt};Je ne chercherais pas à priver les Tarutarus de cette terre de poursuivre la paix. C'est juste que je désire une paix durable, pas la façade temporaire qu'a maintenant Windurst.${prompt}
The apparent tranquility of this place can be considered an illusion born from idealism. Until we wake Windurst from its dream it will continue to be beyond help.${prompt};La tranquillité apparente de cet endroit peut être considérée comme une illusion née de l'idéalisme. Jusqu'à ce que nous réveillions Windurst de son rêve, elle continuera à être hors d'aide.${prompt}
Becoming a soldier is a completely different way of life than being a mere fighter.${prompt};Devenir soldat est un mode de vie complètement différent de celui d'un simple combattant.${prompt}
You are caught between intricate orders and chivalry, and sometimes you have to go against your personal convictions...${prompt};Vous êtes pris entre des ordres complexes et la chevalerie, et parfois vous devez aller à l'encontre de vos convictions personnelles...${prompt}
What is this you speak? The Shadow Lord is being resurrected!?${prompt};De quoi parlez-vous ? Le Seigneur des Ombres est en train d'être ressuscité !?${prompt}
This cannot be!;Cela ne peut pas être !
We'll have to report this to the royal family!${prompt};Nous devrons en informer la famille royale !${prompt}
I shall write an epistle. I will need you to deliver it posthaste to Monarlais Halver back in the motherland.${prompt};Je vais rédiger une lettre. J'aurai besoin que vous la remettiez sans tarder à Monarlais Halver dans la mère patrie.${prompt}
You must protect this letter with your life. Now hurry and deliver it to San d'Oria!${prompt};Vous devez protéger cette lettre avec votre vie. Maintenant, dépêchez-vous de la remettre à San d'Oria !${prompt}
What are you dawdling for, ${choice-player-gender}[boy/girl]? Did I not order you to hurry back to San d'Oria and pass my letter on to Halver, the Monarlais?${prompt};Que faites-vous à traîner, ${choice-player-gender}[garçon/fille] ? Ne vous ai-je pas ordonné de vous dépêcher de retourner à San d'Oria et de remettre ma lettre à Halver, le Monarlais ?${prompt}
Consul Mourices's face has blanched. Did you say something to upset him? Did you not complete your mission correctly?${prompt};Le visage du Consul Mourices a blanchi. Avez-vous dit quelque chose pour le contrarier ? N'avez-vous pas accompli correctement votre mission ?${prompt}
The ferocious monster was really a trap set by the beastmen...? What a horrid turn of events this has proved to be.${prompt};Le monstre féroce était vraiment un piège tendu par les bêtes... ? Quel horrible retournement de situation cela s'est avéré être.${prompt}
Moreover, there is talk of a nether beast appearing?;De plus, il est question de l'apparition d'une bête des ténèbres ?
Could it be...? No! Do not tell me that we are marching forthright into another Great War?${prompt};Est-ce possible... ? Non ! Ne me dites pas que nous nous lançons droit vers une autre Grande Guerre ?${prompt}
You mentioned that when the nether beast appeared, a Mithra guard came to your aid?${prompt};Vous avez mentionné que lorsque la bête des ténèbres est apparue, une garde Mithra est venue à votre secours ?${prompt}
The only Mithra with that degree of strength would be one of the Sibyl Guards from Heavens Tower.${prompt};La seule Mithra avec ce degré de force serait l'une des Gardes Sibylles de la Tour des Cieux.${prompt}

Speakin' of which...I bet that legend o' the great monk Scorpio who fought a giant scorrrpion with his bare hands was also just made up to excite the kiddies, too.${prompt};Regarde ce que j'ai trouvé !${prompt}
Whoa, looky-looky...ain't this somethin'? You didn't happen to break this off with your bare hands, now, did you?${prompt};Cet aventurier a tué un scorpion géant pour obtenir ça. N'est-ce pas incroyable ?${prompt}

Ho-hum...${prompt};Oh !?
Oi, oi! Don't be givin' me no “ho-hums” there, chum! Don't you feel anythin' anywhere in that heart of yours?${prompt};Ah !?${prompt}

With tattered flesh and splintered bone;Sous la terre dort ce roi pirate.${prompt}
He digs till his last breathy.${prompt};Qui aurait cru qu'il y avait des scorpions dans le vieux Labyrinthe de Shakhrami !? Il faut qu'on aille vérifier ça, hein, Gottah !? Oh, et merci beaucoup, aventurier.${prompt}
His eye carved out by a briny blusterrr;Rrralentis, Soni-Muni !
His heart pierced by a scorpion's sting;J'ai entendu que ce labyrinthe n'est pas une simple promenade. Nous n'avons aucune chance à notre niveau actuel, alors il vaudrait mieux s'entraîner d'abord !${prompt}

Beneath the earth sleeps that pirate king.${prompt};Mais alors, on n'aurait pas entendu les nouvelles sur le Labyrinthe de Shakhrami, hein ? Vrrrai ?${prompt}
Who'd have thought there were scorpions in the ol' Maze of Shakhrami!? We've gotta go check this out, eh, Gottah!? Oh, and thanks a lot, adventurer.${prompt};Notre cheftaine a récemment invité Semih Lafihna pour ouvrir le dialogue, mais Semih Lafihna n'a pas accepté l'offre.${prompt}
Hold your horrrses, Soni-Muni!;Ce n'est pas vraiment une surprise. Pour Semih Lafihna, son héritage Mithra n'a aucune importance dans sa position dans la société Tarutaru. Elle aurait aussi bien pu naître Tarutaru.${prompt}
I've hearrrd that maze is no walk in the park. We don't stand a chance at our current level, so we'd better get some trainin' in firrrst!${prompt};Je me demande si la cheftaine allait lui dire la vérité. Mais je suppose que peu importe si la vérité est dite ou non, la rancune restera forte entre elles.${prompt}
That's what I've been sayin'-wayin' all this time! We could have been out there levelin' up instead of standin' here all day! Arrrgh!!!${prompt};Rien ne changerait vraiment...
But then we wouldn't have heard the lowdown on the Maze of Shakhrami, would we? Rrright?${prompt};Mais c'est une affaire qui échappe à nos pattes...${prompt}
Our chieftainness recently invited Semih Lafihna over to open dialogue, but Semih Lafihna did not take her up on the offerrr.${prompt};Par respect pour notre ancienne cheftaine, nous devons aider à préparer le couronnement de Semih Lafihna en tant que nouvelle cheftaine.${prompt}
That's no rrreal surprise. As far as Semih Lafihna is concerned, her Mithran heritage is of no consequence in her position in Tarutaru society. Why, she may as well have been born a Tarutaru.${prompt};Je suppose que tu as raison...
I wonderrr if the chieftainness was going to tell her the truth. But I guess it doesn't matter whetherrr the truth is told or not, as the bad blood will still run thick between them.${prompt};Oh, et quel bon timing, car un aventurier passe justement par ici ! Pourquoi ne pas lui demander s'il peut nous aider dans cette tâche ?${prompt}
Nothing rrreally would change...;Oui, faisons cela... Excusez-moi, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame]...
But that is a matter which is out of our paws...${prompt};Vous ne compteriez pas chasser des monstres dans les Monts Mériphataud prochainement, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Out of honor for our old chieftainness, we must help in the preparations to crown Semih Lafihna as the new chieftainness.${prompt};Excusez-moi ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame]...
I guess you are right...;Vous ne compteriez pas chasser des monstres dans les Monts Mériphataud prochainement, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Oh, and what good timing, for there is an adventurerrr passing by now! Why don't we ask ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] whetherrr ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] can help us out with that task?${prompt};Oh bien, vous en avez trouvé un.
Yes, let's... Excuse me, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/miss]...;Tenez, je vous donne ceci en signe de notre reconnaissance...${prompt}
You wouldn't be intending to hunt monsters in the Meriphataud Mountains any time soon, would you?${prompt};(J'espère juste que cela pourra s'adapter correctement à l'autre gemme...)${prompt}
If you happen to come upon ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, could you please hand it over to us? Oh, and please don't ask why, just do it as a favor for us.

Excuse me ${choice-player-gender}[sir/miss]...;Les pierres jumelles sont, comme leur nom l'indique, une paire parfaite de pierres précieuses qui sont à l'origine trouvées réunies en une seule.${prompt}
You wouldn't be intending to hunt monsters in the Meriphataud Mountains any time soon, would you?${prompt};Aucune autre pierre ne peut les égaler une fois qu'elles sont séparées.

Oh good, you found one.;Puis-je de nouveau vous faire la même demande que la dernière fois ? J'aimerais que vous cherchiez des ${item-plural: 1[2]} dans les Monts Mériphataud.${prompt}

(I just hope it can fit that other gem properly...)${prompt};Bienvenue à la maison de ventes aux enchères.
Deep in the Meriphataud Mountains, there is a bastion of the Yagudo called Castle Oztroja. It is a place where terrific wars were fought.${prompt};Avez-vous des questions sur notre établissement ?${prompt}
Innumerable Mithran fighters were felled there. This ${item-singular: 1[2]} belonged to one of those fallen warriors.${prompt};Que voulez-vous savoir ?
Twinstones are, as their name suggests, a perrrfect pair of gemstones that are originally found joined as one.${prompt};${selection-lines}
No otherrr stones can come close to matching them once they are separated. Since they were once a single stone, only their corresponding halves fit perrrfectly back as one.${prompt};Qu'est-ce que la maison de ventes aux enchères ?
Utilizing this very properrrty, twinstones are used as proof of bonds between Mithra back in our homeland.${prompt};Comment se déroulent les enchères ?
Hello again, adventurer.;Y a-t-il des frais ?
May I again make the same rrrequest as I did before.? I'd like you to search for ${item-plural: 1[2]} in the Meriphataud Mountains.${prompt};Y a-t-il des limites ?
I'll pay a good price for any that you find. Once you find one, please bring it back to me as promptly as you can.${prompt};Comment vérifier les marchandises ?
Welcome to the auction house.;Comment retirer un article ?
Do you have any questions about our establishment?${prompt};Ma liste “Statut des ventes” est pleine !
What do you want to know?;Rien pour le moment.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Les maisons de ventes aux enchères se trouvent dans toutes les grandes villes de Vana'diel. Ici, les aventuriers se rassemblent pour enchérir sur les butins de bataille, les objets indésirables, les anciennes armures... presque tout.${prompt}
What is the auction house?;Actuellement, les maisons de ventes aux enchères à Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, et Jeuno fonctionnent toutes de manière indépendante. Par conséquent, les prix varient d'une ville à l'autre.${prompt}
How are auctions run?;Les aventuriers peuvent utiliser n'importe quelle maison de ventes aux enchères, quel que soit leur nationalité.${prompt}
Are there any fees?;Le premier aventurier à enchérir au prix demandé ou au-dessus de celui-ci achètera automatiquement le produit.${prompt}
Are there any limits?;Une fois mis aux enchères, les marchandises y resteront pendant un maximum de trente semaines de Vana'diel (neuf jours et demi en temps terrestre).${prompt}
How do you check up on merchandise?;Si les marchandises ne sont pas vendues dans ce délai, elles seront retournées à la résidence actuelle du vendeur.${prompt}
How do you remove an item?;Les frais de transaction sont proportionnels au montant pour lequel un article est mis aux enchères. La méthode de calcul de ces frais est différente pour les articles individuels et les articles empilables.${prompt}
My “Sales Status” list is full!;Un frais de transaction est prélevé lorsque des marchandises sont mises aux enchères. Ce frais est non remboursable.${prompt}
Nothing right now.${prompt};Le Comité International des Ventes aux Enchères, ou CIVE, a déclaré qu'un maximum de sept articles peut être mis aux enchères en même temps.${prompt}
Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.${prompt};Cependant, le CIVE a récemment supprimé la limite du nombre d'articles que l'on peut acheter.${prompt}
Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.${prompt};Un certain temps est nécessaire avant que de nouvelles marchandises apparaissent sur notre liste d'enchères.${prompt}
Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.${prompt};Une fois qu'un article apparaît sur votre liste “Statut des ventes”, il peut ne pas immédiatement apparaître sur la liste des enchères. Si vous ne voyez pas votre article sur la liste des enchères, essayez de regarder à nouveau plus tard.${prompt}
The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.${prompt};Si vous souhaitez retirer un article d'une enchère, vous devez vous rendre à la maison de ventes aux enchères, et sélectionner “Arrêter la vente” dans le menu “Statut des ventes”.${prompt}
Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).${prompt};Pour retirer un article de votre liste “Statut des ventes”, vous devez vous rendre à un comptoir d'enchères pour reconnaître la vente ou le retour de votre marchandise.${prompt}
If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.${prompt};Sinon, les articles précédemment vendus ou retournés rempliront votre liste et vous empêcheront de vendre d'autres marchandises.${prompt}
Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.${prompt};À n'importe quel comptoir d'enchères, ouvrez le menu “Statut des ventes” et reconnaissez la transaction pour la supprimer de la liste.${prompt}
A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.${prompt};Appuyez sur le bouton de confirmation pour supprimer toute transaction colorée en jaune (vendue) ou en rouge (retournée).${prompt}
The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.${prompt};Y a-t-il autre chose que vous voudriez savoir ?${prompt}
However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.${prompt};Par le passé, beaucoup ont amassé de grandes richesses grâce à la maison de ventes aux enchères. J'espère que vous trouverez fortune, vous aussi !${prompt}
A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.${prompt};Vana'diel est en effervescence avec la “Reconnaissance des Aventuriers”, kupo !${prompt}
Once an item appears on your “Sales Status” list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.${prompt};Nous, les mogs, avons préparé de petites surprises et rassemblé plein d'informations top secrètes sur l'activité des aventuriers, kupo !
If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select “Stop Sale” from the “Sales Status” menu.${prompt};Laissez-moi consulter mon journal pour vos données statistiques...${prompt}
To remove an item from your “Sales Status” list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.${prompt};Voilà votre vie d'aventurier en un clin d'œil !${prompt}
Otherwise, previously sold or returned items will fill up your list and prevent you from selling any more merchandise.${prompt};Voilà votre vie d'aventurier en un clin d'œil !
At any auction counter, open the “Sales Status” menu and acknowledge the transaction to clear it from the list.${prompt};Et cette fois, il y a un cadeau d'anniversaire extra-spécial ! Oh, faites juste attention à ne pas le jeter accidentellement ou quoi que ce soit, car vous ne pourrez jamais en obtenir un autre... jamais, kupo !${prompt}
Press the confirm button to remove any transaction colored yellow (sold) or red (returned).${prompt};Lequel souhaitez-vous ? (${number: 0} restant)
Is there anything else you would like to know?${prompt};${selection-lines}
In the past, many have amassed great wealth through the auction house. I hope you find fortune, too!${prompt};J'ai besoin de temps pour réfléchir.
Vana'diel is abuzz with “Adventurer Appreciation” fever, kupo!${prompt};Ah, je comprends. Avec tant de surprises à choisir, il n'est pas surprenant que vous vouliez réfléchir un peu plus. Je serai ici une fois que vous aurez décidé, kupo.${prompt}

Take a look--and to think, you can select ${number: 0} more amazing anniversary item!${prompt};You have the choice to either receive your present now, or “wait” to build up the suspense, kupo!${prompt}

${selection-lines};What will you do, kupo?
I need time to think.;${selection-lines}
Ah, I understand. With some many goodies to choose from, it's no surprise that you'd want to think about it a bit more. I'll be here once you've decided, kupo.${prompt};Lemme think, kupo.

If you choose to wait, you might find yourself receiving an even better present, kupo.${prompt};I have a favor to ask, kupo!${prompt}

Getting such a fine weapon for such a cakewalk job... It's almost like stealing!${prompt};Let me tell you, then.
Ah, I've been looking for you.;The signature you got was a “V.”${prompt}
You know how we got those papers from the Tenshodo and delivered them individually?${prompt};How do I know, you ask?
Did you check the signature you got from the Atarefaunet member before giving the papers to Vauderame?${prompt};I can tell what's written on a piece of paper just by touching it.${prompt}
You know, the last signature on the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}? It was a single letter. Did you see it?${prompt};Ah! That's my little thief!
Did you see the signature?;...So, what was the letter?${prompt}
${selection-lines};What was the signature?
Yes.;${selection-lines}
No.${prompt};T
Are you rrreally a thief?;A
Un-be-liev-able!!${prompt};V
Let me tell you, then.;I...forget.${prompt}
The signature you got was a “V.”${prompt};Rrright.
How do I know, you ask?;The signature you got was a “V.”${prompt}
I can tell what's written on a piece of paper just by touching it.${prompt};But the prrroblem is, the initial you got doesn't match the initial of the member's name, rrright?${prompt}
Ah! That's my little thief!;The signature that I got didn't match either.${prompt}
...So, what was the letter?${prompt};This didn't happen to only you and me. I also asked Esca of San d'Oria and Nbu Latteh of Bastok, and it was the same with them.${prompt}
What was the signature?;Doesn't all this seem just a little bit fishy? Doesn't it get your whiskers twitching?${prompt}
${selection-lines};After that task, I did some digging on Atarefaunet's band. It seems that the treasure from the last big heist they pulled off has yet to be found.${prompt}
T;The way I see it, those signatures were some sort of code. To contact the rrremaining members of Atarefaunet's band after all this time just doesn't make sense otherwise.${prompt}
A;Vauderame of the Tenshodo is searching for that treasure. So he threatens Atarefaunet's cutthroats, and collects the code letters...${prompt}
V;I'm gonna collect the signatures from the other six members. Will you help me?${prompt}
I...forget.${prompt};Help out?
Rrright.;${selection-lines}
The signature you got was a “V.”${prompt};Where do I sign?
But the prrroblem is, the initial you got doesn't match the initial of the member's name, rrright?${prompt};I'll keep my paws out of this one...${prompt}
The signature that I got didn't match either.${prompt};Scaredy-cat! You'll never become a world-famous thief at this rate...${prompt}
This didn't happen to only you and me. I also asked Esca of San d'Oria and Nbu Latteh of Bastok, and it was the same with them.${prompt};Are you up for it?${prompt}
Doesn't all this seem just a little bit fishy? Doesn't it get your whiskers twitching?${prompt};Okay, take these.
After that task, I did some digging on Atarefaunet's band.

Vauderame of the Tenshodo is searching for that treasure. So he threatens Atarefaunet's cutthroats, and collects the code letters...${prompt};I'm sure you'll think of something...${prompt}
I'm gonna collect the signatures from the other six members. Will you help me?${prompt};The last obstacle is finding the members' hideouts... At the moment, we know the location of two of the bandits, so why don't you go pay them a visit?${prompt}

Are you up for it?${prompt};From what I saw, to meet with the member in the Goblin store in Jeuno, you have to try your hand at a game of chance.${prompt}
Okay, take these.;Esca was furrrious at being forced to play over and over just because of her bad luck. Are you feeling lucky?${prompt}
I made copies of the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} you rrreceived before. Use them in the same way to get signatures from those brrrigands.${prompt};Just a minute!
Huh? What should you say?;I completely forgot. To climb the towerrr in Sauromugue Champaign, you need to have ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}
I'm sure you'll think of something...${prompt};But even if you have one, you won't be getting up that tower if you're a fat cat!${prompt}
The last obstacle is finding the members' hideouts... At the moment, we know the location of two of the bandits, so why don't you go pay them a visit?${prompt};Did you get those signatures? I have the last two rrright here.${prompt}

Okay, eight letters... Let's put them together...;My m-muscles are so sore!${prompt}
V, Z, A, N, A, T, A, I...${prompt};I finally figured out the code. All those letters we got from the Atarefaunet band...I know what they mean.${prompt}
Hmm... If I put this here... Umm...${prompt};When I rrrearranged the order of the letters, I came out with “Tavnazia.”${prompt}
Huh? You still here?;Tavnazia...
Here, take your loot and scoot. I'll let you know when I figure this out. Come and see me later.${prompt};In other words, the Tavnazian Marquisate. A nation to the west that was obliterated by the beastmen in the Great War.${prompt}
Huh? You still here?;Tavnazia pledged allegiance to San d'Oria and was ruled by Marquis Altedour. But after some investigation, I discovered some slightly more interesting facts.${prompt}
Here, take your loot and scoot. I'll let you know when I figure this out. Come and see me later.${prompt};Just before the nation was swarmed under by the beastmen, the knights of Tavnazia carried away the rrroyal treasure. However, the knights themselves were attacked by brigands and the treasure was stolen.${prompt}
We had our troubles, too.;If you listen to the old thieves, they'll tell you it was the work of the Atarefaunet band. But since the leader of the band died, the truth is anybody's guess.${prompt}
The member I went after told me, “Thieves need to be fleet on their feet.” I had to chase that villain around for hourrrs.${prompt};Isn't this exciting?
Ow, I hurt...;The rrremaining members of the Atarefaunet band must hold the key to the location of the Tavnazian royal treasure!${prompt}
What use is beauty in thieving?;Vauderame of the Tenshodo must be arranging a deal with them to get his greedy hands on the goods.${prompt}
My m-muscles are so sore!${prompt};Now that I know his plans, I'll have to work my way into his circle and get my paws in the pie, too.${prompt}
I finally figured out the code. All those letters we got from the Atarefaunet band...I know what they mean.${prompt};Don't rrrush into anything just yet. There's something wrong. Vauderame hasn't made a move yet.${prompt}
When I rrrearranged the order of the letters, I came out with “Tavnazia.”${prompt};If he had made some sort of deal with the brigands, you would think they would get together somewhere first, then head off to get the treasure.${prompt}
Tavnazia...;Vauderame is a man of many secrets.${prompt}
In other words, the Tavnazian Marquisate. A nation to the west that was obliterated by the beastmen in the Great War.${prompt};Nobody really knows his background, and he loses us every time we try to tail him. There's something dangerous about that man.${prompt}
Tavnazia pledged allegiance to San d'Oria and was ruled by Marquis Altedour. But after some investigation, I discovered some slightly more interesting facts.${prompt};...Hmm.
Just before the nation was swarmed under by the beastmen, the knights of Tavnazia carried away the rrroyal treasure. However, the knights themselves were attacked by brigands and the treasure was stolen.${prompt};A very mysterious character, indeed. Speaking of mysteries, there's one thing that I don't quite understand.${prompt}
If you listen to the old thieves, they'll tell you it was the work of the Atarefaunet band. But since the leader of the band died, the truth is anybody's guess.${prompt};Why did the brigands send the word “Tavnazia” to Vauderame?${prompt}
Isn't this exciting?;Surely he would have already known about the Tavnazian royal treasure before planning to meet with them.${prompt}
The rrremaining members of the Atarefaunet band must hold the key to the location of the Tavnazian royal treasure!${prompt};...That's it!${prompt}
Vauderame of the Tenshodo must be arranging a deal with them to get his greedy hands on the goods.${prompt};${name-player},
Now that I know his plans, I'll have to work my way into his circle and get my paws in the pie, too.${prompt};I want you to go and ask these two thieves a question.${prompt}
Don't rrrush into anything just yet. There's something wrong. Vauderame hasn't made a move yet.${prompt};The person who wrote the papers from the Tenshodo, the name at the top...what was wrrritten there?${prompt}
If he had made some sort of deal with the brigands, you would think they would get together somewhere first, then head off to get the treasure.${prompt};Quickly now! There's no time!${prompt}
Vauderame is a man of many secrets.${prompt};We'll deal with the rest, so hurry! Be on your way!${prompt}
Nobody really knows his background, and he loses us every time we try to tail him. There's something dangerous about that man.${prompt};A nation with allegiance to San d'Oria, ruled by Marquis Altedour... It's supposed to lie farrr to the west of here...${prompt}
...Hmm.;Anyway, let's put the geography lesson aside and go pull the rrrug out from under the Tenshodo! Things have started to get interesting...${prompt}
A very mysterious character, indeed. Speaking of mysteries, there's one thing that I don't quite understand.${prompt};Vauderame is a very mysterrrious character. He's been in the Tenshodo for ten years, quietly building up his current standing.${prompt}
Why did the brigands send the word “Tavnazia” to Vauderame?${prompt};I get the sense that he's made a deliberrrate effort to rrreach a position that allows him to move freely while keeping a low profile.${prompt}
Surely he would have already known about the Tavnazian royal treasure before planning to meet with them.${prompt};Did you get the information I asked for?
...That's it!${prompt};Okay, let's put it all together and see what we have.${prompt}
${name-player},;You've probably already noticed, but the name of the person who wrrrote the papers is different on each one. However, the contents are all exactly the same. A little odd, don't you think?${prompt}

Vauderame used us to tell the bandits to gather at Ordelle's Caves.${prompt};It is said that adventurers follow the winds, traveling far and wide across Vana'diel.${prompt}
We must hurry to Ordelle's Caves!${prompt};I wish for you to meet with Sibyl Guard Semih Lafihna with all haste. Give her this. She should rrreturn here with you.${prompt}
Vauderame used us to tell the bandits to gather at Ordelle's Caves.${prompt};Currently, Semih Lafihna is conducting an investigation in a place called Ranguemont Pass, located on the western continent.${prompt}
What's all the fuss about?;There is little time.

Regions controlled by other nations.;Nous attendons de vous que vous fassiez de votre mieux pour servir votre pays.${prompt}
Regions under beastman control.${prompt};"Vous pouvez voir l'état actuel des conquêtes en sélectionnant ""Info Région"" dans le menu principal."
All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt};Les résultats des conquêtes dans toutes les régions sont régulièrement recalculés, donc vous voudrez peut-être les vérifier de temps en temps.${prompt}
Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt};Les magasins de notre ville vendront des articles différents en fonction de notre rang de conquête.
Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt};La Troupe Valeriano visitera également la nation qui termine première et apportera un peu de joie à ses citoyens.${prompt}
So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt};Vous pouvez faire don de cristaux à votre nation une fois que vous atteignez le rang 2.
Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.;Il vous suffit de les échanger avec des gardes comme moi, et nous veillerons à ce qu'ils soient envoyés à la bonne adresse.${prompt}
They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt};Nous aimerions que vous fassiez des dons de cristaux à votre nation à partir de maintenant.
Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt};Il vous suffit de les échanger avec des gardes comme moi, et nous veillerons à ce qu'ils soient envoyés à la bonne adresse.${prompt}
Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt};Vous pouvez acquérir des cristaux en vainquant des ennemis tant que vous avez le Sceau de votre nation.
So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.;Avoir le Sceau appliqué sur vous est également le seul moyen de participer aux conquêtes.${prompt}
We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt};Des points de rang vous seront attribués pour chaque cristal que vous donnez, et vous pourriez vous voir offrir de nouvelles missions à mesure que votre rang augmente.${prompt}

Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt};Des marchands y seront également placés, et les biens de cette région trouveront leur chemin vers les magasins locaux ici.${prompt}
You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.;Prendre le contrôle des régions est le principe de base des conquêtes. Nous avons besoin que chacun de vous fasse de son mieux et porte notre nation au sommet des classements.${prompt}
Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt};Bien sûr, parfois nous perdons des régions face à d'autres nations... donc nous devons essayer de les reprendre avant que les prochains résultats des conquêtes soient annoncés.${prompt}
Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt};En guise d'incitation, nous vous attribuerons plus de points de conquête pour avoir vaincu des monstres dans ces régions.${prompt}
You also receive rank points for completing missions.;Mais si nous sommes alliés avec une autre nation, vous ne recevrez que le taux régulier pour avoir vaincu des monstres dans les régions de nos alliés. En revanche, nous vous attribuerons plus de points pour combattre dans les régions de la nation classée en tête.${prompt}

S'ils prennent le pouvoir, nous devons tous nous unir et chasser ces créatures viles de cette région.${prompt}
When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt};Nous avons besoin que vous apportiez des fournitures aux gardes-frontières postés dans les régions sous notre contrôle.${prompt}
If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt};"Il y a un poste frontière dans chaque région. Sélectionnez ""Info Région"" dans le menu, et recherchez les zones avec un petit drapeau sur la carte. C'est là qu'ils se trouvent.${prompt}"
Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt};Voici les fournitures. Il vous suffit de les remettre au garde du poste frontière et votre mission sera accomplie.

We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt};Maintenant, choisissez à quel poste vous souhaitez aller.

Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt};Où souhaitez-vous apporter les fournitures ?
As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.${prompt};${selection-lines}

${prompt};Have the winds sent you to me once more...?${prompt}
${prompt};I have just had word that one who knows of the fate of the sinner's daughter can be found in the Blacksmiths' Guild of Mhaura.${prompt}
${prompt};Upon hearing this, the Mithran Tracker immediately set off on her way. I wish for you to also travel to Mhaura and meet with this perrrson.${prompt}
${prompt};You have your task.
${prompt};The blessing of the winds upon you.${prompt}
${prompt};I have learned that one who knows of the fate of the sinner's daughter can be found in the Blacksmiths' Guild of Mhaura.${prompt}
${prompt};Upon hearing this, the Mithran Tracker immediately set off on her way. I wish for you to also travel to Mhaura and meet with this perrrson.${prompt}
${prompt};Twenty years prrrevious, there was a sinner who escaped from her prrrison and fled to this continent.${prompt}
${prompt};There are few Mithra in Windurst who know of her tale. It is a low point in our historrry, and not a thing that is often spoke of...${prompt}
PAUSE${prompt};There is little point in asking those of us who rrremember. We do not talk about it willingly.${prompt}
${number: 1}${prompt};We are of the trrribe to the south. The events that trrranspired among us at that time are taboo. That is all I can tell you.${prompt}
Have the winds sent you to me once more...?${prompt};You have rrreturned.
I have just had word that one who knows of the fate of the sinner's daughter can be found in the Blacksmiths' Guild of Mhaura.${prompt};...And the Mithran Tracker with you.${prompt}
Upon hearing this, the Mithran Tracker immediately set off on her way. I wish for you to also travel to Mhaura and meet with this perrrson.${prompt};After learning the location of the daughter's final rrresting place, we trrraveled to a place known as the Eldieme Necropolis.${prompt}
You have your task.;There, we found ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Piecing togetherrr everything I have heard, I believe it must belong to the sinner's daughter.${prompt}
The blessing of the winds upon you.${prompt};However, one problem rrremains.
I have learned that one who knows of the fate of the sinner's daughter can be found in the Blacksmiths' Guild of Mhaura.${prompt};Where is the other half of the stone?
Upon hearing this, the Mithran Tracker immediately set off on her way. I wish for you to also travel to Mhaura and meet with this perrrson.${prompt};Where is the grrrave of the mother?${prompt}
Twenty years prrrevious, there was a sinner who escaped from her prrrison and fled to this continent.${prompt};We were unable to discover the mother's body.${prompt}
There are few Mithra in Windurst who know of her tale. It is a low point in our historrry, and not a thing that is often spoke of...${prompt};Since she was held captive in the prison of Castle Oztroja, her rrremains should lie there still.${prompt}
There is little point in asking those of us who rrremember. We do not talk about it willingly.${prompt};It is said that the King of Oztroja forces prrrisoners to fight his Yagudo in a hall on the highest level of the castle. The bodies of the fallen are then supposedly thrrrown into a large pond.${prompt}
We are of the trrribe to the south. The events that trrranspired among us at that time are taboo. That is all I can tell you.${prompt};If you search the pond thorrroughly, you may find what you are looking for...${prompt}
You have rrreturned.;Well, I will leave this task to you. Rrreturn here as soon as you find the ${item-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}
...And the Mithran Tracker with you.${prompt};I must apologize, adventurer.
After learning the location of the daughter's final rrresting place, we trrraveled to a place known as the Eldieme Necropolis.${prompt};I would like to send a parrrty of warriors to aid you, but we do not have permission from Tour des Cieux to enter Castle Oztroja.${prompt}
There, we found ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Piecing togetherrr everything I have heard, I believe it must belong to the sinner's daughter.${prompt};The blessing of the earth upon you.${prompt}
However, one problem rrremains.;In the time of the Great War, the warriors held in Oztroja were forced to fight with Yagudo in a hall on the castle's highest floor.${prompt}
Where is the other half of the stone?;The fallen warriors were then thrrrown into a large pond on the upper levels.${prompt}
Where is the grrrave of the mother?${prompt};I believe the ${item-singular: 2[2]} that fits with the ${item-singular: 1[2]} of Syu Befrathi can be found there... However, the talents of a ranger will be needed to discover it.${prompt}
We were unable to discover the mother's body.${prompt};You found it...
Since she was held captive in the prison of Castle Oztroja, her rrremains should lie there still.${prompt};Yes, it's a perrrfect match with Syu Befrathi's ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
It is said that the King of Oztroja forces prrrisoners to fight his Yagudo in a hall on the highest level of the castle. The bodies of the fallen are then supposedly thrrrown into a large pond.${prompt};I'm impressed.
If you search the pond thorrroughly, you may find what you are looking for...${prompt};Tales of mighty adventurers are often little more than exaggerated rumor.${prompt}
Well, I will leave this task to you. Rrreturn here as soon as you find the ${item-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt};However, while this adventurer was perrrforming ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] task, I was busy talking with an important witness.${prompt}
I must apologize, adventurer.;This witness claims that the use of a shining bow was rrresponsible for your loss of sight.${prompt}
I would like to send a parrrty of warriors to aid you, but we do not have permission from Heavens Tower to enter Castle Oztroja.${prompt};The witness also mentioned that the prisoners of Oztroja were saved by a bow that loosed arrows of light so dazzling, the Yagudo were struck blind. This could only describe the Bow of Light.${prompt}
The blessing of the earth upon you.${prompt};It is time for the truth to be known. You are concealing the Bow of Light, aren't you? Have you been seduced by its powerrr, Perih Vashai?${prompt}
In the time of the Great War, the warriors held in Oztroja were forced to fight with Yagudo in a hall on the castle's highest floor.${prompt};Even for one who is blind, surely you can see this has gone on long enough!${prompt}
The fallen warriors were then thrrrown into a large pond on the upper levels.${prompt};......${prompt}
I believe the ${item-singular: 2[2]} that fits with the ${item-singular: 1[2]} of Syu Befrathi can be found there... However, the talents of a ranger will be needed to discover it.${prompt};Very well.
You found it...;It is said that you are not one to run and hide.${prompt}
Yes, it's a perrrfect match with Syu Befrathi's ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};I am in no hurry. Let us leave it at this for now.${prompt}
I'm impressed.;And this, adventurer, I give to you. May you always be on the side of justice.${prompt}
Tales of mighty adventurers are often little more than exaggerated rumor.${prompt};...The Bow of Light.
However, while this adventurer was perrrforming ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] task, I was busy talking with an important witness.${prompt};Thirty years have passed since its creation. And all it has brought us is death and misfortune.${prompt}
This witness claims that the use of a shining bow was rrresponsible for your loss of sight.${prompt};This all started when we came to this continent. The elders called this place the Forbidden Land, and were opposed to the crossing. It all started here...${prompt}
The witness also mentioned that the prisoners of Oztroja were saved by a bow that loosed arrows of light so dazzling, the Yagudo were struck blind. This could only describe the Bow of Light.${prompt};We Mithra receive the blessing of the earth in creating the chieftainness's bow.${prompt}
It is time for the truth to be known. You are concealing the Bow of Light, aren't you? Have you been seduced by its powerrr, Perih Vashai?${prompt};Chieftainness Perih Vashai received the blessing of this land when she made the Azure Bow.${prompt}
Even for one who is blind, surely you can see this has gone on long enough!${prompt};The Bow of Light belongs to the Fire Tribe of the south. The arrows fired from that bow are said to be so powerrrful and so destrrructive, no enemy can stand before them.${prompt}
......${prompt};But no matter how powerrrful a weapon is, our chieftainness would not take up that bow. Its use would contrrradict the code of the ranger.${prompt}
Very well.;...?
It is said that you are not one to run and hide.${prompt};The one who follows you here...${prompt}
I am in no hurry. Let us leave it at this for now.${prompt};Perih Vashai.
And this, adventurer, I give to you. May you always be on the side of justice.${prompt};There is something I wish to ask you. Please give me an answer.${prompt}
...The Bow of Light.;...And what might that be, Semih Lafihna? You wish to ask me about the lost Bow of Light?${prompt}
Thirty years have passed since its creation. And all it has brought us is death and misfortune.${prompt};No, not that. It's about my past...${prompt}
This all started when we came to this continent. The elders called this place the Forbidden Land, and were opposed to the crossing. It all started here...${prompt};I rrrealized something with all this talk of the Bow of Light. The Sibyl Guards, every one of us, were prisoners in Oztroja twenty years ago.${prompt}
We Mithra receive the blessing of the earth in creating the chieftainness's bow.${prompt};I listened to everyone's stories, and they all have memories of being saved by that bow. But for some reason, I have no recollection of it...${prompt}
Chieftainness Perih Vashai received the blessing of this land when she made the Azure Bow.${prompt};I was one of those prisoners as well, wasn't I? I was taken in by Tour des Cieux to keep the secrets of the Bow of Light hidden from the world.${prompt}
The Bow of Light belongs to the Fire Tribe of the south. The arrows fired from that bow are said to be so powerrrful and so destrrructive, no enemy can stand before them.${prompt};Or was there some other reason that only affected me? I don't know how you managed to erase the scent of sin from me, but I must be the sinner's...${prompt}
But no matter how powerrrful a weapon is, our chieftainness would not take up that bow. Its use would contrrradict the code of the ranger.${prompt};Semih Lafihna, I swear on the Azure Bow. You are not the sinner's daughter.${prompt}
...?;Then why?
The one who follows you here...${prompt};The Mithran Tracker assured me there was no record of my parents. And there's one thing I dimly rrrecall...${prompt}
Perih Vashai.;At the time of the Great War, I rrremember my ${item-singular: 1[2]} was switched with another. My past...why...?${prompt}
There is something I wish to ask you. Please give me an answer.${prompt};Why doesn't anybody know about my past?${prompt}
...And what might that be, Semih Lafihna? You wish to ask me about the lost Bow of Light?${prompt};I meant to tell you after all this was over, but I see I have no choice.${prompt}
No, not that. It's about my past...${prompt};Go to Mhaura and meet with Koh Lenbalalako.${prompt}
I rrrealized something with all this talk of the Bow of Light. The Sibyl Guards, every one of us, were prisoners in Oztroja twenty years ago.${prompt};If you take the ${item-singular: 1[2]} I entrrrusted to this adventurer, she will talk with you.${prompt}
I listened to everyone's stories, and they all have memories of being saved by that bow. But for some reason, I have no recollection of it...${prompt};Once Semih Lafihna meets with Koh Lenbalalako of Mhaura, she will understand.${prompt}
I was one of those prisoners as well, wasn't I? I was taken in by Heavens Tower to keep the secrets of the Bow of Light hidden from the world.${prompt};I would like you to follow her to Mhaura. She will need your strrrength to help bring an end to this tale.${prompt}
Or was there some other reason that only affected me? I don't know how you managed to erase the scent of sin from me, but I must be the sinner's...${prompt};The chieftainness wishes Semih Lafihna to see the trrruth with her own eyes.${prompt}
Semih Lafihna, I swear on the Azure Bow. You are not the sinner's daughter.${prompt};Everything becomes clear when you choose to see of your own free will. “Will” represents the eye of the spirit. As a ranger, the vision of your spirit must not become clouded...${prompt}
Then why?;The Mithran Tracker is unwavering in her search for the Bow of Light.${prompt}
The Mithran Tracker assured me there was no record of my parents. And there's one thing I dimly rrrecall...${prompt};But, no matter how she tries to sway us, we will not betrrray our chieftainness. We have sworn to obey the chieftainness in all things.${prompt}
At the time of the Great War, I rrremember my ${item-singular: 1[2]} was switched with another. My past...why...?${prompt};So, you will follow Semih and trrravel to the Northland?${prompt}
Why doesn't anybody know about my past?${prompt};The Northlands are a place of death that we Mithra avoid above all others. It is a land that rrrobs us of the blessing and grace of nature. May the winds watch over you.${prompt}
I meant to tell you after all this was over, but I see I have no choice.${prompt};I now have the Bow of Light in my possession. The magicite that gave this bow its cursed power has been rrreturned to the land where it belongs.${prompt}
Go to Mhaura and meet with Koh Lenbalalako.${prompt};I wish to express my heartfelt grrratitude to you, Semih Lafihna, for rrretrieving it from the wilds of the Northlands.${prompt}
If you take the ${item-singular: 1[2]} I entrrrusted to this adventurer, she will talk with you.${prompt};It was not I who found the bow. That honor belongs to the adventurer ${name-player}.${prompt}
Once Semih Lafihna meets with Koh Lenbalalako of Mhaura, she will understand.${prompt};I see. I have much to thank you for.${prompt}
I would like you to follow her to Mhaura. She will need your strrrength to help bring an end to this tale.${prompt};Ah, but words of thanks have little value to an adventurer, do they? Instead, I will give you these.${prompt}
The chieftainness wishes Semih Lafihna to see the trrruth with her own eyes.${prompt};It is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.
Everything becomes clear when you choose to see of your own free will. “Will” represents the eye of the spirit. As a ranger, the vision of your spirit must not become clouded...${prompt};Please take them as a symbol of my rrrespect for your skill as a ranger.${prompt}
The Mithran Tracker is unwavering in her search for the Bow of Light.${prompt};And so, Chieftainness Perih Vashai, I leave this land behind me to begin my next hunt.${prompt}
But, no matter how she tries to sway us, we will not betrrray our chieftainness. We have sworn to obey the chieftainness in all things.${prompt};...And just like that, she leaves...${prompt}
So, you will follow Semih and trrravel to the Northland?${prompt};...Hmmm, the Tracker's real task here was most likely the destruction of the Bow of Light.${prompt}
The Northlands are a place of death that we Mithra avoid above all others. It is a land that rrrobs us of the blessing and grace of nature. May the winds watch over you.${prompt};And not catching the sinner?${prompt}
I now have the Bow of Light in my possession. The magicite that gave this bow its cursed power has been rrreturned to the land where it belongs.${prompt};I don't know for certain, but the homeland was definitely more concerned with the Bow of Light than the sinner's daughter.${prompt}
I wish to express my heartfelt grrratitude to you, Semih Lafihna, for rrretrieving it from the wilds of the Northlands.${prompt};In that case, the magicite's power must truly be dreadful.${prompt}
It was not I who found the bow. That honor belongs to the adventurer ${name-player}.${prompt};......
I see. I have much to thank you for.${prompt};Magicite rrresembles crystals. Or rather, the power contained in magicite is similar to, or perhaps greater than, that contained in crystals.${prompt}
Ah, but words of thanks have little value to an adventurer, do they? Instead, I will give you these.${prompt};But both are unnatural creations. The powerrr of magicite is an ominous, cursed energy. It is a manifestation of evil that we cannot tolerrrate.${prompt}
It is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.;The Chieftainness of the Fire Tribe, Nhev Befrathi, knew this. And after seeing the bow for ourselves, the Mithran Tracker and I knew it too.${prompt}
Please take them as a symbol of my rrrespect for your skill as a ranger.${prompt};That crystal calls to those of Mithran blood. It awakens feelings of envy, of jealousy. It darkens the nature of the heart.${prompt}
And so, Chieftainness Perih Vashai, I leave this land behind me to begin my next hunt.${prompt};Nhev Befrathi and her daughter, however, had the strength to rrresist its influence. Even though they used the bow, the light in their hearts rrremained.${prompt}
...And just like that, she leaves...${prompt};...I understand now.
...Hmmm, the Tracker's real task here was most likely the destruction of the Bow of Light.${prompt};Perih Vashai, you lost the light when you drew back the string of that cursed weapon.${prompt}
And not catching the sinner?${prompt};Yes. I saw the power of that bow and closed my eyes to it.${prompt}
I don't know for certain, but the homeland was definitely more concerned with the Bow of Light than the sinner's daughter.${prompt};You desire nothing in a world where you see nothing. There is nothing to be afraid of.${prompt}
In that case, the magicite's power must truly be dreadful.${prompt};......
......;I rrrespect you, Perih Vashai. I don't know if I could have done the same in your place.${prompt}
Magicite rrresembles crystals. Or rather, the power contained in magicite is similar to, or perhaps greater than, that contained in crystals.${prompt};But for that, I twisted the path you were to walk. To save Syu Befrathi, I erased the existence of my own daughter...${prompt}
But both are unnatural creations. The powerrr of magicite is an ominous, cursed energy. It is a manifestation of evil that we cannot tolerrrate.${prompt};......${prompt}
The Chieftainness of the Fire Tribe, Nhev Befrathi, knew this. And after seeing the bow for ourselves, the Mithran Tracker and I knew it too.${prompt};...Perih Vashai.
That crystal calls to those of Mithran blood. It awakens feelings of envy, of jealousy. It darkens the nature of the heart.${prompt};I have no feelings of hate towards you. It is my duty to listen to the voice of naturrre.${prompt}
Nhev Befrathi and her daughter, however, had the strength to rrresist its influence. Even though they used the bow, the light in their hearts rrremained.${prompt};I will come to see you again.
...I understand now.;Until then, may the wind guide your footsteps.
Perih Vashai, you lost the light when you drew back the string of that cursed weapon.${prompt};Occasionally, you too should try seeing the world through closed eyes.${prompt}
Yes. I saw the power of that bow and closed my eyes to it.${prompt};What is there, in your inner world? ...Who do you see?${prompt}
You desire nothing in a world where you see nothing. There is nothing to be afraid of.${prompt};All of the children taken in by Tour des Cieux lost their mothers. Under normal circumstances, they would be sent to our homeland to be cared for by other Mithra.${prompt}
......;You rrrealize why they were not sent to the homeland, don't you? The chieftainness wished to watch over the growth of her child, Semih Lafihna...Even if it meant being despised...${prompt}
I rrrespect you, Perih Vashai. I don't know if I could have done the same in your place.${prompt};We know what the chieftainness felt when she gave up her child for the sake of rrreturning the Bow of Light to its rrrightful place.${prompt}
But for that, I twisted the path you were to walk. To save Syu Befrathi, I erased the existence of my own daughter...${prompt};She had to abandon her rrrole as a mother in order to fulfil her duties as a chieftainness, and as a ranger. I wonder if Semih Lafihna understands this?${prompt}
......${prompt};Ho there, adventurer.
...Perih Vashai.;Have you come to take on the search for the ${item-plural: 1[2]}?${prompt}
I have no feelings of hate towards you. It is my duty to listen to the voice of naturrre.${prompt};There's actually no longer a need for it... But we should honor the brave warriors who brought about this time of peace.${prompt}
I will come to see you again.;Well, if you find any, bring them here the same as usual.${prompt}
Until then, may the wind guide your footsteps.;Ah, you've arrived.
Occasionally, you too should try seeing the world through closed eyes.${prompt};With your help, Semih Lafihna has become a little more rrreceptive to the words of the chieftainness.${prompt}
What is there, in your inner world? ...Who do you see?${prompt};Now we have some peace around here. Especially since the Mithran Tracker has returned home convinced of the fate of the sinner's daughter.${prompt}
All of the children taken in by Heavens Tower lost their mothers. Under normal circumstances, they would be sent to our homeland to be cared for by other Mithra.${prompt};Hmmm? You also went to Eldieme Necropolis to confirm her death?${prompt}
You rrrealize why they were not sent to the homeland, don't you? The chieftainness wished to watch over the growth of her child, Semih Lafihna...Even if it meant being despised...${prompt};Heh-heh-heh.
We know what the chieftainness felt when she gave up her child for the sake of rrreturning the Bow of Light to its rrrightful place.${prompt};That wasn't the rrremains of the daughter. It was the final rrresting place of her mother, Nhev Befrathi.${prompt}
She had to abandon her rrrole as a mother in order to fulfil her duties as a chieftainness, and as a ranger. I wonder if Semih Lafihna understands this?${prompt};We had another adventurer like you find a set of ownerless-earrings. We placed them in the necropolis long before you got there.${prompt}
Ho there, adventurer.;Chieftainness Perih Vashai had predicted that another Mithran Tracker would show up eventually.${prompt}
Have you come to take on the search for the ${item-plural: 1[2]}?${prompt};But if you do happen to find any ${item-plural: 1[2]} in the Meriphataud Mountains, bring them here. I'll buy them from you.${prompt}
There's actually no longer a need for it... But we should honor the brave warriors who brought about this time of peace.${prompt};They belonged to the Mithran warriors responsible for bringing about this time of peace. They should be properly honored.${prompt}
Well, if you find any, bring them here the same as usual.${prompt};If you ever find any ${item-plural: 1[2]} in the Meriphataud Mountains, bring them back here. I will buy them from you to honor the fallen.${prompt}
Ah, you've arrived.;We found many earrings but had a terrible time trying to find the missing halves...I thought furrr was going to fly.${prompt}
With your help, Semih Lafihna has become a little more rrreceptive to the words of the chieftainness.${prompt};I wonder if the Mithran Tracker really believes that the daughter is dead... We can't let our guarrrd down yet.${prompt}
Now we have some peace around here. Especially since the Mithran Tracker has returned home convinced of the fate of the sinner's daughter.${prompt};You found some?
Hmmm? You also went to Eldieme Necropolis to confirm her death?${prompt};Here, take this with my thanks.${prompt}
Heh-heh-heh.;Hello, adventurer.
That wasn't the rrremains of the daughter. It was the final rrresting place of her mother, Nhev Befrathi.${prompt};If you find any ${item-plural: 1[2]}, bring them here to me.${prompt}
We had another adventurer like you find a set of ownerless-earrings. We placed them in the necropolis long before you got there.${prompt};Let us honor the Mithran warriors who fell in the Meriphataud Mountains.${prompt}
Chieftainness Perih Vashai had predicted that another Mithran Tracker would show up eventually.${prompt};Captain Rakoh Buuma was sooo angrrry, y'know? She was saying something like, “Lately the guards of Windurst Woods have rrreally been slacking off! Slacking off completely!”...I think.${prompt}
But if you do happen to find any ${item-plural: 1[2]} in the Meriphataud Mountains, bring them here. I'll buy them from you.${prompt};Now that the airship route to the southern continent has been reopened, there might be some trrrouble amongst the Mithra of Windurst...I think.
They belonged to the Mithran warriors responsible for bringing about this time of peace. They should be properly honored.${prompt};...Gotta stay alert, y'know?${prompt}
If you ever find any ${item-plural: 1[2]} in the Meriphataud Mountains, bring them back here. I will buy them from you to honor the fallen.${prompt};Captain Rakoh Buuma has been fuming that the guards of Windurst Woods have “rrreally been slacking off, slacking off completely”!${prompt}
We found many earrings but had a terrible time trying to find the missing halves...I thought furrr was going to fly.${prompt};I wonderrr if she found out about me fishing during patrol duty? I'm not gonna fish anymorrre! I'm gonna do my job properly!${prompt}
I wonder if the Mithran Tracker really believes that the daughter is dead... We can't let our guarrrd down yet.${prompt};W-we were r-reprimanded by Captain Rakoh Buuma. She was growling that we guards of Windurst Woods have rrreally been slacking off... “Slacking off completely,” she said!${prompt}
You found some?;I, erm, I think she was angry b-because I, I don'taru get along with Mithra very well...
Here, take this with my thanks.${prompt};M-maybe I sh-should try to invite Sola Jaab along on a fishing trip s-sometime.${prompt}
Hello, adventurer.;Ajido-Marujido...
If you find any ${item-plural: 1[2]}, bring them here to me.${prompt};Minister of the Orastery and head of the Mage Academy. This mission has been issued by him.${prompt}
Let us honor the Mithran warriors who fell in the Meriphataud Mountains.${prompt};It says here that you should head to the Orastery right away. There's nothing written about the nature of the mission, but...it's a direct order from the ministerrr. You should hurry along.${prompt}
Captain Rakoh Buuma was sooo angrrry, y'know? She was saying something like, “Lately the guards of Windurst Woods have rrreally been slacking off! Slacking off completely!”...I think.${prompt};...This is a mission ordered by Ajido-Marujido, head of the Mage Academy. He wants you to head to the Orastery rrright away.${prompt}
Now that the airship route to the southern continent has been reopened, there might be some trrrouble amongst the Mithra of Windurst...I think.;The mission parameters are strictly confidential... I wonder what he'll ask of you?${prompt}
...Gotta stay alert, y'know?${prompt};Where did she hear about it, I wonder...?
Captain Rakoh Buuma has been fuming that the guards of Windurst Woods have “rrreally been slacking off, slacking off completely”!${prompt};Semih Lafihna, she like, totally wanted to know everything about this mission from Ajido-Marujido.${prompt}
I wonderrr if she found out about me fishing during patrol duty? I'm not gonna fish anymorrre! I'm gonna do my job properly!${prompt};She seemed kinda on edge, y'know?
W-we were r-reprimanded by Captain Rakoh Buuma. She was growling that we guards of Windurst Woods have rrreally been slacking off... “Slacking off completely,” she said!${prompt};Even Captain Buuma, who like, totally hates Semih, was like, “Oh, okay, this is what the mission is about,”...or something like that.${prompt}
I, erm, I think she was angry b-because I, I don'taru get along with Mithra very well...;Things are so easygoing herrre lately.
M-maybe I sh-should try to invite Sola Jaab along on a fishing trip s-sometime.${prompt};It's nice to have some peace in Windurst for a change.${prompt}
Ajido-Marujido...;Up until now there have been so many heart-stopping incidents. Farrr too many. We should try and preserve this peace for a while.${prompt}
Minister of the Orastery and head of the Mage Academy. This mission has been issued by him.${prompt};S-speaking of Minister Ajido-Marujido, I, I heard Minister Tosuka-Porika of the Optistery c-calling him a thiefy-wief.${prompt}
It says here that you should head to the Orastery right away. There's nothing written about the nature of the mission, but...it's a direct order from the ministerrr. You should hurry along.${prompt};I, I mean, they've never been the besty-westy of friends, but I w-wonder what else could have h-happened?
...This is a mission ordered by Ajido-Marujido, head of the Mage Academy. He wants you to head to the Orastery rrright away.${prompt};It gives me b-butterflies in my tummy-wummy.${prompt}
The mission parameters are strictly confidential... I wonder what he'll ask of you?${prompt};......
Where did she hear about it, I wonder...?;I mustaru help my brother...!
Semih Lafihna, she like, totally wanted to know everything about this mission from Ajido-Marujido.${prompt};I havetaru be strong...!${prompt}
She seemed kinda on edge, y'know?;You have been summoned to Tour des Cieux by order of the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
Even Captain Buuma, who like, totally hates Semih, was like, “Oh, okay, this is what the mission is about,”...or something like that.${prompt};Could this be rrrelated to the arrest of Minister Ajido-Marujido by the Sibyl Guards? You will probably be interrogated on the details of your previous mission. Make haste to Tour des Cieux.${prompt}
Things are so easygoing herrre lately.;You have been summoned to Tour des Cieux by order of the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
It's nice to have some peace in Windurst for a change.${prompt};...Ah yes, if you happen to meet with Semih Lafihna, tell her this: No matter what the Star Sibyl says, we Mithra will follow the path of our beliefs.${prompt}
Up until now there have been so many heart-stopping incidents. Farrr too many. We should try and preserve this peace for a while.${prompt};The D-Dark D-Dungeon is the w-worst punishment that a criminal can g-getaru.${prompt}
S-speaking of Minister Ajido-Marujido, I, I heard Minister Tosuka-Porika of the Optistery c-calling him a thiefy-wief.${prompt};There's n-no leaving the Dark Dungeon until you d-die. H-h-h-how h-h-h-horrible!${prompt}
I, I mean, they've never been the besty-westy of friends, but I w-wonder what else could have h-happened?;What an uproarrr!
It gives me b-butterflies in my tummy-wummy.${prompt};There's been anotherrr incident!${prompt}
......;...But being a Tarutaru problem, it's probably nothing to get worked up about. He'll just get a slap on the wrist and a week in jail or something similarrr, I would think.${prompt}
I mustaru help my brother...!;I always thought Tour des Cieux just did, y'know, prophecies and stuff. But the Star Sibyl rrreally, like, lays down the law when she has to.${prompt}
I havetaru be strong...!${prompt};What did the Orastery minister get up to, anyway? I mean, what's under that crumbly old tower, like, y'know?${prompt}
You have been summoned to Heavens Tower by order of the Star Sibyl.${prompt};Now that the Sibyl Guards are checking all the missions, it really gets my hackles up.${prompt}
Could this be rrrelated to the arrest of Minister Ajido-Marujido by the Sibyl Guards? You will probably be interrogated on the details of your previous mission. Make haste to Heavens Tower.${prompt};Well, leaving all that aside, your next mission comes from the Optistery. They are rrrequesting assistance with tidying up the book vault.${prompt}
You have been summoned to Heavens Tower by order of the Star Sibyl.${prompt};The Optistery must have been happy with your past performance to ask for you by name.${prompt}
...Ah yes, if you happen to meet with Semih Lafihna, tell her this: No matter what the Star Sibyl says, we Mithra will follow the path of our beliefs.${prompt};Go to the Optistery and talk to the minister for the details of your mission.${prompt}
The D-Dark D-Dungeon is the w-worst punishment that a criminal can g-getaru.${prompt};...Oh, it's a little late, but...
There's n-no leaving the Dark Dungeon until you d-die. H-h-h-how h-h-h-horrible!${prompt};Congratulations on rrreaching rrrank seven.${prompt}
What an uproarrr!;I, I, I don't like to talk aboutaru people this way, b-b-but please take c-c-care around the Sibyl Guards.${prompt}
There's been anotherrr incident!${prompt};I, I, I think they're k-k-k-eeping a close eye on y-y-you.
...But being a Tarutaru problem, it's probably nothing to get worked up about. He'll just get a slap on the wrist and a week in jail or something similarrr, I would think.${prompt};W-w-watch your back on the streets at n-n-night...${prompt}
I always thought Heavens Tower just did, y'know, prophecies and stuff. But the Star Sibyl rrreally, like, lays down the law when she has to.${prompt};I despise cleaning, but I love those frog books.${prompt}
What did the Orastery minister get up to, anyway? I mean, what's under that crumbly old tower, like, y'know?${prompt};If I were a rank seven adventurerrr being offered this mission... Rrr, what a dilemma!${prompt}
Now that the Sibyl Guards are checking all the missions, it really gets my hackles up.${prompt};You know the Minister of the Manustery...Miss Apururu? She doesn't like, y'know, smile as much as she used to.${prompt}
Well, leaving all that aside, your next mission comes from the Optistery. They are rrrequesting assistance with tidying up the book vault.${prompt};Even when she does smile, it's like, not rrreally a smile, y'know? I'm a girrrl, too. I know these things... I think.${prompt}
The Optistery must have been happy with your past performance to ask for you by name.${prompt};This is a mission issued by the Rrrhinostery.${prompt}
Go to the Optistery and talk to the minister for the details of your mission.${prompt};The Rrrhinostery wishes your help in a certain matter. Speak with the rrresearcher Leepe-Hoppe for the full details. He can be found on the second floor of the Rrrhinostery.${prompt}
...Oh, it's a little late, but...;I have a feeling something bad has happened. I hope you're able to straighten things out for them.${prompt}
Congratulations on rrreaching rrrank seven.${prompt};This mission entails helping out the Rrrhinostery. Speak with the rrresearcher Leepe-Hoppe for the full details. He can be found on the second floor of the Rrrhinostery.${prompt}
I, I, I don't like to talk aboutaru people this way, b-b-but please take c-c-care around the Sibyl Guards.${prompt};The Sibyl Guards had nothing to say about this mission. Does this mean the Rrrhinostery is considered above suspicion? Or does it mean that something more sinister already has their full attention?${prompt}
I, I, I think they're k-k-k-eeping a close eye on y-y-you.;I, I, I've heard that Minister R-R-Rukususu of the R-R-Rhinostery is investigating a-a-ancient ruins in the Northlands.${prompt}
W-w-watch your back on the streets at n-n-night...${prompt};S-S-She is looking into things like, erm...the reason why the Northlands have towers similar to the ones found in S-S-Sarutabaruta. Wh-wh-why would that be, I wonder?${prompt}
I despise cleaning, but I love those frog books.${prompt};We Mithra came to Windurst from a village far to the south.${prompt}
If I were a rank seven adventurerrr being offered this mission... Rrr, what a dilemma!${prompt};...I don't really rememberrr much about it, though. Just that it was always hot.${prompt}
You know the Minister of the Manustery...Miss Apururu? She doesn't like, y'know, smile as much as she used to.${prompt};Have you ever been to the southern continent?
Even when she does smile, it's like, not rrreally a smile, y'know? I'm a girrrl, too. I know these things... I think.${prompt};There are lots of, like, rrreally rrrare plants and stuff... I think.${prompt}
This is a mission issued by the Rrrhinostery.${prompt};We use those plants to make, y'know, medicine and weapons and stuff like that.
The Rrrhinostery wishes your help in a certain matter. Speak with the rrresearcher Leepe-Hoppe for the full details. He can be found on the second floor of the Rrrhinostery.${prompt};We Mithra are, like, children of nature, y'know?${prompt}
I have a feeling something bad has happened. I hope you're able to straighten things out for them.${prompt};Before I explain your mission, I wish to congratulate you.${prompt}
This mission entails helping out the Rrrhinostery. Speak with the rrresearcher Leepe-Hoppe for the full details. He can be found on the second floor of the Rrrhinostery.${prompt};Well done on rrreaching rrrank eight.
The Sibyl Guards had nothing to say about this mission. Does this mean the Rrrhinostery is considered above suspicion? Or does it mean that something more sinister already has their full attention?${prompt};There aren't many people who can make it this far.${prompt}
I, I, I've heard that Minister R-R-Rukususu of the R-R-Rhinostery is investigating a-a-ancient ruins in the Northlands.${prompt};Rrright, down to brass tacks.
S-S-She is looking into things like, erm...the reason why the Northlands have towers similar to the ones found in S-S-Sarutabaruta. Wh-wh-why would that be, I wonder?${prompt};Your next mission is from the Aurastery. You can get the details from the teachers at the School of Magic.${prompt}
We Mithra came to Windurst from a village far to the south.${prompt};The School of Magic is another name for the Aurastery. The teachers there will explain your mission objectives.${prompt}
...I don't really rememberrr much about it, though. Just that it was always hot.${prompt};Rrrecently, there have been rrrumors of feral Cardians gathering at the magic towers of the Horutoto Ruins. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?${prompt}
Have you ever been to the southern continent?;D-d-did you know that they h-h-have lots of m-m-magical dolls at the Aurastery?${prompt}
There are lots of, like, rrreally rrrare plants and stuff... I think.${prompt};O-o-originally there were only a f-f-few types, but Professor Koru-Moru has re-re-remodeled them for various tasks.${prompt}
We use those plants to make, y'know, medicine and weapons and stuff like that.;Let me see...
We Mithra are, like, children of nature, y'know?${prompt};...You have ${choice: 1}[50/60/70/80/90/100] points!${prompt}
Before I explain your mission, I wish to congratulate you.${prompt};What do I mean, ${choice: 1}[50/60/70/80/90/100] points?
Well done on rrreaching rrrank eight.;Ah, now that would be telling!${prompt}
There aren't many people who can make it this far.${prompt};F...f...froggies!${prompt}
Rrright, down to brass tacks.;Meow!${prompt}
Your next mission is from the Aurastery. You can get the details from the teachers at the School of Magic.${prompt};The Principal of the School of Magic is Professor Koru-Moru, y'know? But, like, a few years back, there was a different guy doing the job, y'know?${prompt}
The School of Magic is another name for the Aurastery. The teachers there will explain your mission objectives.${prompt};What's really weird is that you don't hear anything about that guy. Tarutaru are, like, totally into their rumors, so I thought it was kinda strange.${prompt}
Rrrecently, there have been rrrumors of feral Cardians gathering at the magic towers of the Horutoto Ruins. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?${prompt};This mission has not been officially approved. However, all of the gatehouse guards have agreed to ask you to perform this task.${prompt}
D-d-did you know that they h-h-have lots of m-m-magical dolls at the Aurastery?${prompt};Go to the Manustery and assist Minister Apururu. Those are your orders.${prompt}
O-o-originally there were only a f-f-few types, but Professor Koru-Moru has re-re-remodeled them for various tasks.${prompt};I don't think I need to tell you this, but don't tell anyone about this mission. Be especially careful of that Semih Lafihna. She has a habit of picking up on rrrumors from the most unlikely places.${prompt}
Let me see...;Don't make me rrrepeat myself. Head to the Manustery and talk with Minister Apururu. This is your mission.${prompt}
...You have ${choice: 1}[50/60/70/80/90/100] points!${prompt};Keep your orders to yourself, and be especially careful that Semih Lafihna doesn't get wind of what you're doing.${prompt}
What do I mean, ${choice: 1}[50/60/70/80/90/100] points?;Th-th-this is not a b-b-betrayal of the S-S-Star Sibyl.${prompt}
Ah, now that would be telling!${prompt};W-w-we just want to h-h-help Minister Apururu. The Orastery needs your h-h-help too.${prompt}
F...f...froggies!${prompt};Things are getting exciting now! All the guards arrre in on this secret together!${prompt}
Meow!${prompt};I can hardly contain myself! But I won't let on to anyone. I'll just flick my tail and keep it in.${prompt}
The Principal of the School of Magic is Professor Koru-Moru, y'know? But, like, a few years back, there was a different guy doing the job, y'know?${prompt};Miiri-Wohri is, like, totally freaked about this mission.${prompt}
What's really weird is that you don't hear anything about that guy. Tarutaru are, like, totally into their rumors, so I thought it was kinda strange.${prompt};But even if we, like, y'know, get found out and stuff, they'll just throw us all into the dungeon for a couple of days. It'll be like a sleepover!${prompt}
This mission has not been officially approved. However, all of the gatehouse guards have agreed to ask you to perform this task.${prompt};You have my thanks.
Go to the Manustery and assist Minister Apururu. Those are your orders.${prompt};I'm sure you've heard from the guards how terribly-werribly important this mission is to me.${prompt}
I don't think I need to tell you this, but don't tell anyone about this mission. Be especially careful of that Semih Lafihna. She has a habit of picking up on rrrumors from the most unlikely places.${prompt};As you know, my brother, Minister Ajido-Marujido, has now spent a considerable amountaru of time in the Dark Dungeon.${prompt}
Don't make me rrrepeat myself. Head to the Manustery and talk with Minister Apururu. This is your mission.${prompt};My brother is a very resilient person.
Keep your orders to yourself, and be especially careful that Semih Lafihna doesn't get wind of what you're doing.${prompt};However, the Dark Dungeon is a chamber that drains magical power. To spend this much time in there...${prompt}
Th-th-this is not a b-b-betrayal of the S-S-Star Sibyl.${prompt};I beg of you!
W-w-we just want to h-h-help Minister Apururu. The Orastery needs your h-h-help too.${prompt};Please help me save him! I know this goes against all the rules, but I have to help my brother!${prompt}
Things are getting exciting now! All the guards arrre in on this secret together!${prompt};Help out?
I can hardly contain myself! But I won't let on to anyone. I'll just flick my tail and keep it in.${prompt};${selection-lines}
Miiri-Wohri is, like, totally freaked about this mission.${prompt};Leave it to me!
But even if we, like, y'know, get found out and stuff, they'll just throw us all into the dungeon for a couple of days. It'll be like a sleepover!${prompt};It's too risky.${prompt}
You have my thanks.;......
I'm sure you've heard from the guards how terribly-werribly important this mission is to me.${prompt};That's true... But I know you can do it.${prompt}
As you know, my brother, Minister Ajido-Marujido, has now spent a considerable amountaru of time in the Dark Dungeon.${prompt};...Thank you.
My brother is a very resilient person.;${name-player}...${prompt}
However, the Dark Dungeon is a chamber that drains magical power. To spend this much time in there...${prompt};I've been researching a way to save my brother.${prompt}
I beg of you!;The chambers that lie beneath the central tower are sealed with the power of the stars and the moon. This means that the doors to those chambers can only be opened with an item imbued with that same power.${prompt}
Please help me save him! I know this goes against all the rules, but I have to help my brother!${prompt};The rings carry-warried by the ministers are such items. Every time a minister is appointed, a ring is made and presented to the new minister by Tour des Cieux.${prompt}
Help out?;After learning this, I took the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} and set off for the Dark Dungeon...${prompt}
${selection-lines};Give it up, Apururu.
Leave it to me!;That seal is beyond you.${prompt}
It's too risky.${prompt};Professor Shantotto...${prompt}
......;I heard you were sneaking around, asking people about the Dark Dungeon.
That's true... But I know you can do it.${prompt};Why don't you just stand at the top of Tour des Cieux and yell, “I'm going to break my brother out of jail. Arrest me, someone!”${prompt}
...Thank you.;How imprudent.
${name-player}...${prompt};And you were always such a bright student.${prompt}
I've been researching a way to save my brother.${prompt};I won'taru just stand by and let my brother waste away in there! But I can't...the door won't...${prompt}
The chambers that lie beneath the central tower are sealed with the power of the stars and the moon. This means that the doors to those chambers can only be opened with an item imbued with that same power.${prompt};I understand how you feel. I don't want to lose him either.
The rings carry-warried by the ministers are such items. Every time a minister is appointed, a ring is made and presented to the new minister by Heavens Tower.${prompt};Especially after all the trouble I've gone through to raise a tough-as-nails, wicked-wand-wielding, savage-spell-slinging wizard to take over as Orastery minister...${prompt}
After learning this, I took the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} and set off for the Dark Dungeon...${prompt};Listen up and I'll explain about the door deep below the tower.${prompt}
Give it up, Apururu.;This door, as you've discovered, can be opened by the power of the stars and the moon. Everything in the Horutoto Ruins is governed by this power.${prompt}
That seal is beyond you.${prompt};However, the magic sealing these doors was weakened when several of the towers were severely damaged during the Great War.${prompt}
Professor Shantotto...${prompt};And so up until now, these doors could have been opened with a single minister's ring--no need for a charm created by Tour des Cieux, like before.${prompt}
I heard you were sneaking around, asking people about the Dark Dungeon.;...!${prompt}
Why don't you just stand at the top of Heavens Tower and yell, “I'm going to break my brother out of jail. Arrest me, someone!”${prompt};Haven't you figured it out? What does that head of yours contain?
How imprudent.;You would have realized it by now if you were using that melon you call a brain.${prompt}
And you were always such a bright student.${prompt};If you'll recall, Ajido-Marujido restored the power of the ruins, my dear dumpling.
I won'taru just stand by and let my brother waste away in there! But I can't...the door won't...${prompt};Now, you are no longer able to open the doors by using just a single ring.${prompt}
I understand how you feel. I don't want to lose him either.;Ohoho, such stupidity!${prompt}
Especially after all the trouble I've gone through to raise a tough-as-nails, wicked-wand-wielding, savage-spell-slinging wizard to take over as Orastery minister...${prompt};......${prompt}
Listen up and I'll explain about the door deep below the tower.${prompt};...Ah, forgive my amusement. I didn't come just to laugh at you.
This door, as you've discovered, can be opened by the power of the stars and the moon. Everything in the Horutoto Ruins is governed by this power.${prompt};I have a brilliant idea to help your brother through.${prompt}
However, the magic sealing these doors was weakened when several of the towers were severely damaged during the Great War.${prompt};Really, Professor Shantotto?
And so up until now, these doors could have been opened with a single minister's ring--no need for a charm created by Heavens Tower, like before.${prompt};Please tell me what I have to do.${prompt}
...!${prompt};Ohoho!
Haven't you figured it out? What does that head of yours contain?;You must gather the rings of the five ministers. Yes, yes. It is a chore.
You would have realized it by now if you were using that melon you call a brain.${prompt};But, using their combined power, you should be able to dispel the seal on the door.${prompt}
If you'll recall, Ajido-Marujido restored the power of the ruins, my dear dumpling.;Bring the five rings to my house in Windurst Walls.
Now, you are no longer able to open the doors by using just a single ring.${prompt};We can only get started when you have them all.
Ohoho, such stupidity!${prompt};Ohoho!${prompt}
......${prompt};Thank you so much, Professor. I will never forget this.${prompt}
...Ah, forgive my amusement. I didn't come just to laugh at you.;You'd better not. Ah, and there's one more thing you'd better not forget.
I have a brilliant idea to help your brother through.${prompt};Don't think of going after the rings yourself. It would be something you'd regret.${prompt}
Really, Professor Shantotto?;Leave it to an adventurer who's capable.
Please tell me what I have to do.${prompt};Do you know ${name-player}? ${choice-player-gender}[He's/She's] very useful and usable.${prompt}
Ohoho!;It almost boggles the mind how eager ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] is to stick ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] nose into some dangerous squeeze.
You must gather the rings of the five ministers. Yes, yes. It is a chore.;There's no reason not to take advantage of ${name-player}'s natural tendencies.${prompt}
But, using their combined power, you should be able to dispel the seal on the door.${prompt};This is why I need your help.
Bring the five rings to my house in Windurst Walls.;Here... This is my ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
We can only get started when you have them all.;I know it's a lot to ask, but...please save my brother. I beg of you.${prompt}
Ohoho!${prompt};With the rings of the five ministers, I should be able to open the Dark Dungeon. Please gather all five rings and take them to Professor Shantotto.${prompt}
Thank you so much, Professor. I will never forget this.${prompt};Please, save Ajido-Marujido. My poor, dear brother...${prompt}
You'd better not. Ah, and there's one more thing you'd better not forget.;We have a lot to thank Minister Ajido-Marujido for. He might have mumble-grumbled about it, but he was always there to bail the Manustery out of money troubles.${prompt}
Don't think of going after the rings yourself. It would be something you'd regret.${prompt};We justaru follow whatever Minister Apururu decides. No mattaru what happens, we're behind her until the fat Galka sings.${prompt}
Leave it to an adventurer who's capable.;Minister Ajido-Marujido succeeded in reactivating the towers, didn'taru he?${prompt}
Do you know ${name-player}? ${choice-player-gender}[He's/She's] very useful and usable.${prompt};Isn't that a good thing?
It almost boggles the mind how eager ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] is to stick ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] nose into some dangerous squeeze.;Why'd they have to go and throw him into the Dark Dungeon?${prompt}
There's no reason not to take advantage of ${name-player}'s natural tendencies.${prompt};“Rules were made to be broken.”
This is why I need your help.;That way of thinking got Minister Ajido-Marujido thrown in the slammer-wammer.${prompt}
Here... This is my ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};And now his younger sister, Minister Apururu, has taken up the motto:
I know it's a lot to ask, but...please save my brother. I beg of you.${prompt};“Jails were made to be broken.”${prompt}
With the rings of the five ministers, I should be able to open the Dark Dungeon. Please gather all five rings and take them to Professor Shantotto.${prompt};Of course! I had totarully forgotten.
Please, save Ajido-Marujido. My poor, dear brother...${prompt};When my brother was arrested, his ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} was confiscated by Tour des Cieux...${prompt}
We have a lot to thank Minister Ajido-Marujido for. He might have mumble-grumbled about it, but he was always there to bail the Manustery out of money troubles.${prompt};There's no way Semih Lafihna will just hand it over for no good reason. Maybe if you try talking with Kupipi...${prompt}
We justaru follow whatever Minister Apururu decides. No mattaru what happens, we're behind her until the fat Galka sings.${prompt};What's that!?
Minister Ajido-Marujido succeeded in reactivating the towers, didn'taru he?${prompt};The Cardians have chosen a king!?
Isn't that a good thing?;What on Vana'diel are they thinking!?${prompt}
Why'd they have to go and throw him into the Dark Dungeon?${prompt};I understand when Cardians no longer follow the orders of their masters. This happens when the concept of “master” ceases to have meaning to them.${prompt}
“Rules were made to be broken.”;But after this has happened, they shouldn't be taking on a new master. For that to happen...${prompt}
That way of thinking got Minister Ajido-Marujido thrown in the slammer-wammer.${prompt};......
And now his younger sister, Minister Apururu, has taken up the motto:;No. It's not possible!${prompt}
“Jails were made to be broken.”${prompt};......
Of course! I had totarully forgotten.;But putting that aside for the moment, please take the rings to Professor Shantotto in Windurst Walls.${prompt}
When my brother was arrested, his ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} was confiscated by Heavens Tower...${prompt};I mustaru apologize, I was a little-bitty distracted by what you told me...${prompt}
There's no way Semih Lafihna will just hand it over for no good reason. Maybe if you try talking with Kupipi...${prompt};...Please take the rings to Professor Shantotto in Windurst Walls.${prompt}
What's that!?;I mustaru apologize, I was a little-bitty distracted by what you told me...${prompt}
The Cardians have chosen a king!?;You've completed the preparations for opening the Dark Dungeon!? Wonderful! You have my mostaru heartfelt thanks!${prompt}
What on Vana'diel are they thinking!?${prompt};Now, to the Dark Dungeon we go!
I understand when Cardians no longer follow the orders of their masters. This happens when the concept of “master” ceases to have meaning to them.${prompt};...Oh, that won't do. Professor Shantotto said I shouldn't be seen traveling with you.${prompt}
But after this has happened, they shouldn't be taking on a new master. For that to happen...${prompt};We'll rendezvous by the door. Please be careful, ${name-player}.${prompt}
......;Now, to the Dark Dungeon we go!
No. It's not possible!${prompt};...Oh, that won't do. Professor Shantotto said I shouldn't be seen traveling with you.${prompt}
......;We'll rendezvous by the door. Please be careful, ${name-player}.${prompt}
But putting that aside for the moment, please take the rings to Professor Shantotto in Windurst Walls.${prompt};${name-player}.
I mustaru apologize, I was a little-bitty distracted by what you told me...${prompt};...My brother has yet to open his eyes...${prompt}
...Please take the rings to Professor Shantotto in Windurst Walls.${prompt};Professor Shantotto came to check on his condition, but there was nothing she could do...
I mustaru apologize, I was a little-bitty distracted by what you told me...${prompt};If he doesn't regain consciousness...${prompt}
You've completed the preparations for opening the Dark Dungeon!? Wonderful! You have my mostaru heartfelt thanks!${prompt};......
Now, to the Dark Dungeon we go!;But I must stay strong. Thank you, adventurer.${prompt}
...Oh, that won't do. Professor Shantotto said I shouldn't be seen traveling with you.${prompt};I will never forget what you have done to help my dear brother.${prompt}
We'll rendezvous by the door. Please be careful, ${name-player}.${prompt};Oh, and about the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}... Professor Shantotto still...${prompt}
Now, to the Dark Dungeon we go!;Well, perhaps you should go and ask the professor.${prompt}
...Oh, that won't do. Professor Shantotto said I shouldn't be seen traveling with you.${prompt};${name-player}.
We'll rendezvous by the door. Please be careful, ${name-player}.${prompt};...My brother has yet to open his eyes...${prompt}
${name-player}.;Professor Shantotto came to check on his condition, but there was nothing she could do...
...My brother has yet to open his eyes...${prompt};If he doesn't regain consciousness...${prompt}
Professor Shantotto came to check on his condition, but there was nothing she could do...;Things don'taru look good.
If he doesn't regain consciousness...${prompt};If Ajido-Marujido doesn't wake up, Minister Apururu may have murder-wurder to answer for...not just a jailbreak!${prompt}
......;Wait a minute.
But I must stay strong. Thank you, adventurer.${prompt};Wasn't there an adventurer who went to the dungeon with the minister? What if we shift all the blame onto ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]...?${prompt}
I will never forget what you have done to help my dear brother.${prompt};You're worried, rightaru?
Oh, and about the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}... Professor Shantotto still...${prompt};I'm worried about Minister Ajido-Marujido, too.${prompt}
Well, perhaps you should go and ask the professor.${prompt};I'm so worried, the Cardians I've made have learned how to sigh from me. What a dilemma. <sigh>${prompt}
${name-player}.;I can'taru believe there was a jailbreaky!
...My brother has yet to open his eyes...${prompt};Minister Apururu is so cooly!${prompt}
Professor Shantotto came to check on his condition, but there was nothing she could do...;But I get the feelingy there was someone along to help her... It went just a little too well for one of Minister Apururu's schemeys.${prompt}
If he doesn't regain consciousness...${prompt};There's a Windurst Waters merrrchant making a big fuss over a Mana Orb, you say?${prompt}
Things don'taru look good.;Ahaha, serves him rrright!
If Ajido-Marujido doesn't wake up, Minister Apururu may have murder-wurder to answer for...not just a jailbreak!${prompt};That old coot, Honoi-Gomoi, always trrrying to get what he wants by any means possible.${prompt}
Wait a minute.;He seems terribly anxious to get his hands on that orb. Why don't you be a sporrrt and give it back? I promise I won't say anything.${prompt}
Wasn't there an adventurer who went to the dungeon with the minister? What if we shift all the blame onto ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]...?${prompt};You want to talk to me about Mana Orbs?
You're worried, rightaru?;I'm sorry, but I'm up to my earlobes in work at the moment. Could you come back another time?${prompt}
I'm worried about Minister Ajido-Marujido, too.${prompt};This is...
I'm so worried, the Cardians I've made have learned how to sigh from me. What a dilemma. <sigh>${prompt};This is a terribly-werribly old Cardian card...${prompt}
I can'taru believe there was a jailbreaky!;But there's something strange about it. There's no mark, just this odd-bodd picture. I can't sense any magic from it, either.${prompt}
Minister Apururu is so cooly!${prompt};How unusual. Ordinarily, Cardian cards are imbued with powerful magic.${prompt}
But I get the feelingy there was someone along to help her... It went just a little too well for one of Minister Apururu's schemeys.${prompt};The Cardian cards were a creation of my father, the previous Minister of the Manustery. The holder of the card could use it to remove the magic animating the card's respective Cardian.${prompt}
There's a Windurst Waters merrrchant making a big fuss over a Mana Orb, you say?${prompt};Do you understand the whammy-ramifications of this? The older Cardians could use the cards in their possession to deactivate other Cardians.${prompt}
Ahaha, serves him rrright!;...My father had essentially made it possible for Cardians to kill each other, just like people can. Isn't that horrible-worrible...?${prompt}
That old coot, Honoi-Gomoi, always trrrying to get what he wants by any means possible.${prompt};Ah, forgive me!
He seems terribly anxious to get his hands on that orb. Why don't you be a sporrrt and give it back? I promise I won't say anything.${prompt};I seem to have drifted on to a darker topic.
You want to talk to me about Mana Orbs?;Enough of that, back to this card!${prompt}
I'm sorry, but I'm up to my earlobes in work at the moment. Could you come back another time?${prompt};This card holds no power over its respective Cardian. Which means it's more than likely just a reject.${prompt}
This is...;Either that...or could it be...
This is a terribly-werribly old Cardian card...${prompt};This card has no respective Cardian?
But there's something strange about it. There's no mark, just this odd-bodd picture. I can't sense any magic from it, either.${prompt};That would mean that this is a unique card...${prompt}
How unusual. Ordinarily, Cardian cards are imbued with powerful magic.${prompt};${name-player}, please let me buy this card off you!
The Cardian cards were a creation of my father, the previous Minister of the Manustery. The holder of the card could use it to remove the magic animating the card's respective Cardian.${prompt};I'm sure there's more to this than meets the eye!${prompt}
Do you understand the whammy-ramifications of this? The older Cardians could use the cards in their possession to deactivate other Cardians.${prompt};Have you heard?
...My father had essentially made it possible for Cardians to kill each other, just like people can. Isn't that horrible-worrible...?${prompt};Ajido-Marujido has rrregained consciousness.${prompt}
Ah, forgive me!;Word of these goings-on has yet to rrreach Tour des Cieux, so keep up the charade on your way to the Manustery.${prompt}
I seem to have drifted on to a darker topic.;Ajido-Marujido had been in a coma since collapsing in the Dark Dungeon, rrright?${prompt}
Enough of that, back to this card!${prompt};He would probably be dead by now if no one had gone to save him. What an awful place.${prompt}
This card holds no power over its respective Cardian. Which means it's more than likely just a reject.${prompt};Th-the Orastery Minister has finally r-regained c-consciousness.${prompt}
Either that...or could it be...;D-do you realize now what a t-terrible-werrible place the Dark Dungeon is? Even a p-powerful mage like Ajido-Marujido wasn't immune to its e-effects.${prompt}
This card has no respective Cardian?;These Tarutaru sure can be a vicious little bunch.${prompt}
That would mean that this is a unique card...${prompt};We Mithra would neverrr leave someone anguishing in torment like that. Those who transgress against Mithran law are cut down cleanly and face-to-face by the Mithran Trackerrr.${prompt}
${name-player}, please let me buy this card off you!;Tour des Cieux is gonna, like, totally notice that the Dark Dungeon is empty at any time now.${prompt}
I'm sure there's more to this than meets the eye!${prompt};We Mithra are born with, you know, a sixth sense and stuff. You can bet that Semih Lafihna's tail is totally twitching right now.${prompt}
Have you heard?;Ah, ${name-player}--my dear brother has finally woken from his coma!${prompt}
Ajido-Marujido has rrregained consciousness.${prompt};He's right here. Please come with me!${prompt}
Word of these goings-on has yet to rrreach Heavens Tower, so keep up the charade on your way to the Manustery.${prompt};${name-player}, we have some serious-werious problems!${prompt}
Ajido-Marujido had been in a coma since collapsing in the Dark Dungeon, rrright?${prompt};Thanks to you, I was able to see all that was written in the Book of the Gods. We must act before Windurst is wiped off the face of Vana'diel...${prompt}
He would probably be dead by now if no one had gone to save him. What an awful place.${prompt};After I found you missing from the Dark Dungeon, I knew I'd find you here, Ajido-Marujido!${prompt}
Th-the Orastery Minister has finally r-regained c-consciousness.${prompt};Semih Lafihna!?${prompt}
D-do you realize now what a t-terrible-werrible place the Dark Dungeon is? Even a p-powerful mage like Ajido-Marujido wasn't immune to its e-effects.${prompt};Great galloping gigas, I just can't get away from you...${prompt}
These Tarutaru sure can be a vicious little bunch.${prompt};I'm not here to arrest you this time. You must come with me to Tour des Cieux immediately!${prompt}
We Mithra would neverrr leave someone anguishing in torment like that. Those who transgress against Mithran law are cut down cleanly and face-to-face by the Mithran Trackerrr.${prompt};The bearer of darkness has returned!${prompt}
Heavens Tower is gonna, like, totally notice that the Dark Dungeon is empty at any time now.${prompt};The bearer of darkness!?
We Mithra are born with, you know, a sixth sense and stuff. You can bet that Semih Lafihna's tail is totally twitching right now.${prompt};What of the Star Sibyl?${prompt}
Ah, ${name-player}--my dear brother has finally woken from his coma!${prompt};We don't know. We haven't been able to open the door to her chambers. But with your magic, we should be able to get in...${prompt}
He's right here. Please come with me!${prompt};I don't think I've ever seen Semih Lafihna in such a tizzy-wizzy.${prompt}
${name-player}, we have some serious-werious problems!${prompt};The Star Sibyl... Ajido-Marujido... I hope they'll be okay...${prompt}
Thanks to you, I was able to see all that was written in the Book of the Gods. We must act before Windurst is wiped off the face of Vana'diel...${prompt};Goddess! Are you certain? Ajido-Marujido has received a pardon from the Star Sibyl!?${prompt}
After I found you missing from the Dark Dungeon, I knew I'd find you here, Ajido-Marujido!${prompt};And permission to enter Karaha-Baruha's Animastery... No matter how many times I hear it, I just can'taru believe it...!${prompt}
Semih Lafihna!?${prompt};Apururu. I know you have-ethy a lot on your mind with Ajido-Marujido and all, but I wonder if I might have a moment-ethy?${wait-animation: 2}
Great galloping gigas, I just can't get away from you...${prompt};Doctor Yoran-Oran!${prompt}
I'm not here to arrest you this time. You must come with me to Heavens Tower immediately!${prompt};Ahem. I was given this letter by an adventurer. Apparently it was dropped-ethy by a mandragora inside the Boyahda Tree...${prompt}
The bearer of darkness has returned!${prompt};...?${prompt}
The bearer of darkness!?;Wait, this handwriting...!?${prompt}
What of the Star Sibyl?${prompt};I see you recognize-ethy the author. He's being held-ethy prisoner somewhere in the Boyahda Tree, and needs help to escape.${prompt}
We don't know. We haven't been able to open the door to her chambers. But with your magic, we should be able to get in...${prompt};But I figured-ethy, considering who...
I don't think I've ever seen Semih Lafihna in such a tizzy-wizzy.${prompt};I figured-ethy I should leave this mattaru up to you and your brother.${prompt}
The Star Sibyl... Ajido-Marujido... I hope they'll be okay...${prompt};So much has passed-ethy between you siblings and the author of that letter. I'll justaru pretend-ethy that I never saw it.${prompt}
Goddess! Are you certain? Ajido-Marujido has received a pardon from the Star Sibyl!?${prompt};Well, I've taken up enough-ethy of your time. Keep your chin up, little Apururu.${prompt}
And permission to enter Karaha-Baruha's Animastery... No matter how many times I hear it, I just can'taru believe it...!${prompt};What should I do...? I can't think straightaru. All this time I thought he had died.${prompt}
Apururu. I know you have-ethy a lot on your mind with Ajido-Marujido and all, but I wonder if I might have a moment-ethy?${wait-animation: 2};Goddess above! My father, alive! I don't know what to do. What should I do, adventurer?${prompt}
Doctor Yoran-Oran!${prompt};What to do?
Ahem. I was given this letter by an adventurer. Apparently it was dropped-ethy by a mandragora inside the Boyahda Tree...${prompt};${selection-lines}
...?${prompt};We must save him!
Wait, this handwriting...!?${prompt};Leave him to rot!${prompt}
I see you recognize-ethy the author. He's being held-ethy prisoner somewhere in the Boyahda Tree, and needs help to escape.${prompt};Usually, that would be my firstaru thought, but...${prompt}
But I figured-ethy, considering who...;I almostaru wish I could, but...${prompt}
I figured-ethy I should leave this mattaru up to you and your brother.${prompt};Could I ask you to help me? I want you to go to the Boyahda Tree and find my father...Zonpa-Zippa.${prompt}
So much has passed-ethy between you siblings and the author of that letter. I'll justaru pretend-ethy that I never saw it.${prompt};And when you do find him, if...if he really is alive, I have some questions I want you to ask him. Why did the Cardians rise up against him? Who is this Cardian they have chosen for a king?${prompt}
Well, I've taken up enough-ethy of your time. Keep your chin up, little Apururu.${prompt};Help Apururu?
What should I do...? I can't think straightaru. All this time I thought he had died.${prompt};${selection-lines}
Goddess above! My father, alive! I don't know what to do. What should I do, adventurer?${prompt};Leave it to me!
What to do?;Leave him to rot!${prompt}
${selection-lines};I'm begging you. I have no desire to see my father again. I don'taru want to end up hating him even more than I do now.${prompt}
We must save him!;${name-player}, thank you for being so understanding!${prompt}
Leave him to rot!${prompt};Ah, one more thing. Please don't tell any of this to my brother. I wouldn't want news of our father to interfere with his importantaru research.${prompt}
Usually, that would be my firstaru thought, but...${prompt};If my father really is alive in the Boyahda Tree, I have some questions I want you to ask him. Why did the Cardians rise up against him? Who is this Cardian they have chosen for a king?${prompt}
I almostaru wish I could, but...${prompt};I really should be asking my dear brother's advice on this mattaru, but I wouldn't want news of our father to interfere with his research...${prompt}
Could I ask you to help me? I want you to go to the Boyahda Tree and find my father...Zonpa-Zippa.${prompt};...
And when you do find him, if...if he really is alive, I have some questions I want you to ask him. Why did the Cardians rise up against him? Who is this Cardian they have chosen for a king?${prompt};I still can'taru believe my father was alive...${prompt}
Help Apururu?;Hmm? You have a letter from him? An explanation for the actions of the Cardians?${prompt}
${selection-lines};This is incredible...! Joker was created by the famous Karaha-Baruha...!?${prompt}
Leave it to me!;What was that bit about Karaha-Baruha?${wait-animation: 1}
Leave him to rot!${prompt};...Ajido-Marujido!${prompt}
I'm begging you. I have no desire to see my father again. I don'taru want to end up hating him even more than I do now.${prompt};What's wrong with you? You went all pasty-wasty white as soon as you saw me. What mischief have you been up to?${prompt}
${name-player}, thank you for being so understanding!${prompt};I...${prompt}
Ah, one more thing. Please don't tell any of this to my brother. I wouldn't want news of our father to interfere with his importantaru research.${prompt};I don't know what to say. To hear this...and on top of knowing the old coot was still breathing...${prompt}
If my father really is alive in the Boyahda Tree, I have some questions I want you to ask him. Why did the Cardians rise up against him? Who is this Cardian they have chosen for a king?${prompt};The King of the Cardians is the creation of a dead genius? What on Vana'diel is going on!?${prompt}
I really should be asking my dear brother's advice on this mattaru, but I wouldn't want news of our father to interfere with his research...${prompt};There's something I don't understand. Who brought the Cardian back to life in the first place? How was this possible?${prompt}
...;You need a massive amountaru of magic to restore life to a Cardian. Not to mention the use of forbidden rituals...${prompt}
I still can'taru believe my father was alive...${prompt};...${prompt}
Hmm? You have a letter from him? An explanation for the actions of the Cardians?${prompt};Even more importantaru is the fact that the ritual would have brought Karaha-Baruha back from the dead.${prompt}
This is incredible...! Joker was created by the famous Karaha-Baruha...!?${prompt};And if he really is alive and kicking again, why hasn't he been to see the Star Sibyl?${prompt}
What was that bit about Karaha-Baruha?${wait-animation: 1};Is there something preventaruing him from putting in an appearance? Or is he planning something, off in the shadows...?${prompt}
...Ajido-Marujido!${prompt};...
What's wrong with you? You went all pasty-wasty white as soon as you saw me. What mischief have you been up to?${prompt};A summoning...${prompt}
I...${prompt};That's it! Karaha-Baruha was focused on perfecting a “complete summoning.”${prompt}
I don't know what to say. To hear this...and on top of knowing the old coot was still breathing...${prompt};Karaha-Baruha wasn't trying to enlist the aid of the Great Beast, Fenrir. He wanted to completely enslave its will.${prompt}
The King of the Cardians is the creation of a dead genius? What on Vana'diel is going on!?${prompt};If he had succeeded in his efforts... Karaha-Baruha wouldn't be the only one brought back to life...${prompt}
There's something I don't understand. Who brought the Cardian back to life in the first place? How was this possible?${prompt};${name-player}! The Full Moon Fountain! We mustaru stop the Star Sibyl!${prompt}
You need a massive amountaru of magic to restore life to a Cardian. Not to mention the use of forbidden rituals...${prompt};${name-player}, please go after my brother!${prompt}
...${prompt};The Full Moon Fountain...! I've got an awfully bad feeling about this!${prompt}
Even more importantaru is the fact that the ritual would have brought Karaha-Baruha back from the dead.${prompt};...
And if he really is alive and kicking again, why hasn't he been to see the Star Sibyl?${prompt};I g-got an advance on my s-salary...${prompt}
Is there something preventaruing him from putting in an appearance? Or is he planning something, off in the shadows...?${prompt};This m-month I have to try to g-get by on ${item-plural: 1[2]}...${prompt}
...;......
A summoning...${prompt};Grrr...${prompt}
That's it! Karaha-Baruha was focused on perfecting a “complete summoning.”${prompt};Captain Buuma said something that really upset me...! I'm in such a state, my furrr is starting to fall out...!${prompt}
Karaha-Baruha wasn't trying to enlist the aid of the Great Beast, Fenrir. He wanted to completely enslave its will.${prompt};I just saw Ajido-Marujido leaving the Manustery in, like, full view...${prompt}
If he had succeeded in his efforts... Karaha-Baruha wouldn't be the only one brought back to life...${prompt};Should he be, y'know, walking around outside and stuff? Shouldn't he be using, like, some sorta invisibility spell thingy?${prompt}
${name-player}! The Full Moon Fountain! We mustaru stop the Star Sibyl!${prompt};What happened at the Full Moon Fountain? I wanted to ask my brother, but he hasn't visitarued the Manustery at all lately.${prompt}
${name-player}, please go after my brother!${prompt};Maybe I should go to the Animastery to talk with him. Something about all this is really giving me the heeber-jeebers...${prompt}
The Full Moon Fountain...! I've got an awfully bad feeling about this!${prompt};I heard that Minsiter Ajido-Marujido was pardoned for his crimes. Well, isn'taru that a surprise?${prompt}
...;This is, y'know, one of those high-level, governmentaru things. There's gotta be some back room, political-type dealy-weals going on here.${prompt}
I g-got an advance on my s-salary...${prompt};Do you know what's going on, ${name-player}? Ajido-Marujido has been pardoned for his crimes, and the guards have escaped any disciplinary action, despite our insubordination...${prompt}
This m-month I have to try to g-get by on ${item-plural: 1[2]}...${prompt};Has something happened within Tour des Cieux? They've sent us another mission for you.${prompt}
......;According to the mission statement, the Yagudo have proposed a rrrevision to the peace treaty...${prompt}
Grrr...${prompt};...
Captain Buuma said something that really upset me...! I'm in such a state, my furrr is starting to fall out...!${prompt};I'm well aware I shouldn't be poking my nose where it doesn't belong, but my Mithran instincts are making my tail twitch.${prompt}
I just saw Ajido-Marujido leaving the Manustery in, like, full view...${prompt};Tour des Cieux has rrrequested your presence. The Yagudo have sent a proposal to the Star Sibyl asking for a rrrevision of the peace treaty.${prompt}
Should he be, y'know, walking around outside and stuff? Shouldn't he be using, like, some sorta invisibility spell thingy?${prompt};The Star Sibyl is more likely to keep the peace, rrrather than object to any of the Yagudo's rrridiculous demands...${prompt}
What happened at the Full Moon Fountain? I wanted to ask my brother, but he hasn't visitarued the Manustery at all lately.${prompt};...
Maybe I should go to the Animastery to talk with him. Something about all this is really giving me the heeber-jeebers...${prompt};Naturally, I have been informed of Semih Lafihna's report to Chieftainness Perih Vashai.${prompt}
I heard that Minsiter Ajido-Marujido was pardoned for his crimes. Well, isn'taru that a surprise?${prompt};Let us worry about the Yagudo--You just keep your mind on the task you have been given. Are we clear?${prompt}
This is, y'know, one of those high-level, governmentaru things. There's gotta be some back room, political-type dealy-weals going on here.${prompt};M-Minister Ajido-Marujido has been a-absolved of his crimes! N-now Windurst can f-finally return to a state of peace!${prompt}
Do you know what's going on, ${name-player}? Ajido-Marujido has been pardoned for his crimes, and the guards have escaped any disciplinary action, despite our insubordination...${prompt};...Wh-what?
Has something happened within Heavens Tower? They've sent us another mission for you.${prompt};Wh-why are you l-looking at me with p-pity like thataru...?${prompt}
According to the mission statement, the Yagudo have proposed a rrrevision to the peace treaty...${prompt};P-please don't t-tell me something else is wr-wrong!${prompt}
...;Captain Buuma was saying that our work might dry up completely after this next mission. If that happens, I'm gonna go hungry.${prompt}
I'm well aware I shouldn't be poking my nose where it doesn't belong, but my Mithran instincts are making my tail twitch.${prompt};That's why I've started fishing again. I bought the most amazing fishing rod! It was so nice of Miiri-Wohri to lend me the money!${prompt}
Heavens Tower has rrrequested your presence. The Yagudo have sent a proposal to the Star Sibyl asking for a rrrevision of the peace treaty.${prompt};Even though you, like, totally trrrashed the beastmen's boss guy, the Yagudo still act like they're tougher than us.${prompt}
The Star Sibyl is more likely to keep the peace, rrrather than object to any of the Yagudo's rrridiculous demands...${prompt};Something fishy's going on. It's like, the Yagudo are prrreying on our weaknesses...or something like that. You're, y'know, all important and stuff, so you should know what's going on, rrright?${prompt}
...;${name-player}, you have the task of gathering the three verses left by the ancient ones, don'taru you?${prompt}
Naturally, I have been informed of Semih Lafihna's report to Chieftainness Perih Vashai.${prompt};Ajido-Marujido mentioned Ro'Maeve, the Chamber of Oracles, and The Temple of Uggalepih...I'm pretty sure.${prompt}
Let us worry about the Yagudo--You just keep your mind on the task you have been given. Are we clear?${prompt};All this talk of ancient peoples and places I've never-ever even heard of... My brother seems to have gained some amazing knowledge.${prompt}
M-Minister Ajido-Marujido has been a-absolved of his crimes! N-now Windurst can f-finally return to a state of peace!${prompt};I'm certain that we'll be able to save the Star Sibyl now that he's back with us. We mustaru play our parts, too.${prompt}
...Wh-what?;Minister Apururu has been up late every night, researchingy the old Cardians made by Zonpa-Zippa.${prompt}
Wh-why are you l-looking at me with p-pity like thataru...?${prompt};It's really very simple if you wanted to disabley the old Cardians. All you would have to do is searchy out Minister Zonpa-Zippa and takey him out of the picture...${prompt}
P-please don't t-tell me something else is wr-wrong!${prompt};Wa-wa-wait!
Captain Buuma was saying that our work might dry up completely after this next mission. If that happens, I'm gonna go hungry.${prompt};That justaru slippedy out! I don'taru want to go to the Dark Dungeon!${prompt}
That's why I've started fishing again. I bought the most amazing fishing rod! It was so nice of Miiri-Wohri to lend me the money!${prompt};You would definitely be able to slow the Cardians down with a big ol' blast of magey-wagey power.${prompt}
Even though you, like, totally trrrashed the beastmen's boss guy, the Yagudo still act like they're tougher than us.${prompt};But the problem is where do you get that kinda power, and who do you get to handle it? To be perfectaruly honest I don't think Miss Apururu is up to it.${prompt}
Something fishy's going on. It's like, the Yagudo are prrreying on our weaknesses...or something like that. You're, y'know, all important and stuff, so you should know what's going on, rrright?${prompt};Hmmm...if you could draw on the Mana Orbs of all the Cardians in town then maybe...
${name-player}, you have the task of gathering the three verses left by the ancient ones, don'taru you?${prompt};I better not suggestaru that to the minister, she would just keel over from worry.${prompt}
Ajido-Marujido mentioned Ro'Maeve, the Chamber of Oracles, and The Temple of Uggalepih...I'm pretty sure.${prompt};Minsiter Apururu is doing her bestaru to hide something from us...${prompt}
All this talk of ancient peoples and places I've never-ever even heard of... My brother seems to have gained some amazing knowledge.${prompt};But she's so bad at lying-wying it makes it hard for us to pretend that we don't notice.${prompt}
I'm certain that we'll be able to save the Star Sibyl now that he's back with us. We mustaru play our parts, too.${prompt};...I have heard from Semih Lafihna that a time of rrreckoning has come to this land.${prompt}
Minister Apururu has been up late every night, researchingy the old Cardians made by Zonpa-Zippa.${prompt};We Mithra have always known that the world is but a sharrrd of a greater power.${prompt}
It's really very simple if you wanted to disabley the old Cardians. All you would have to do is searchy out Minister Zonpa-Zippa and takey him out of the picture...${prompt};The abundant life and light born from that sharrrd, that single destiny...${prompt}
Wa-wa-wait!;...Leave the Yagudo to us. We will not fall against the tides of evil. You, too, must make your stand.${prompt}
That justaru slippedy out! I don'taru want to go to the Dark Dungeon!${prompt};There is no need for panic. We alrrready have details on the enemy's army within our grrrasp.${prompt}
You would definitely be able to slow the Cardians down with a big ol' blast of magey-wagey power.${prompt};We have done more than simply glare at the Yagudo these past twenty years.${prompt}
But the problem is where do you get that kinda power, and who do you get to handle it? To be perfectaruly honest I don't think Miss Apururu is up to it.${prompt};Several of our units are already concealed near the Yagudo strrronghold.${prompt}
Hmmm...if you could draw on the Mana Orbs of all the Cardians in town then maybe...;As soon as the enemy makes its move, we'll go straight for the thrrroat. I can almost see the panicked faces of those Yagudo wrrretches.${prompt}
I better not suggestaru that to the minister, she would just keel over from worry.${prompt};The magic doll...builtaru by Professor Koru-Moru...${prompt}
Minsiter Apururu is doing her bestaru to hide something from us...${prompt};Wearing the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}...made by Doctor Shantotto...${prompt}
But she's so bad at lying-wying it makes it hard for us to pretend that we don't notice.${prompt};Then have Doctor Yoran-Oran constructaru the seal...${prompt}
...I have heard from Semih Lafihna that a time of rrreckoning has come to this land.${prompt};Oh, adventurer!
We Mithra have always known that the world is but a sharrrd of a greater power.${prompt};You've brought all three verses!?${prompt}
The abundant life and light born from that sharrrd, that single destiny...${prompt};It's time then! I mustaru go to Doctor Yoran-Oran's manor and pick up the finished work.${prompt}
...Leave the Yagudo to us. We will not fall against the tides of evil. You, too, must make your stand.${prompt};My brother should be waiting in Tour des Cieux. Please tell him that I'll be rightaru there!${prompt}
There is no need for panic. We alrrready have details on the enemy's army within our grrrasp.${prompt};Adventurer! We mustaru hurry to the Full Moon Fountain!${prompt}
We have done more than simply glare at the Yagudo these past twenty years.${prompt};I have no idea what's going to happen, so we should be prepared for the doom-gloomiest worst. It may come down to a battle with the Bearer of Darkness!${prompt}
Several of our units are already concealed near the Yagudo strrronghold.${prompt};You have done your utmost for Windurst these many months. As the Captain of the Windurst Woods guards, I formally extend to you our gratitude and friendship.${prompt}
As soon as the enemy makes its move, we'll go straight for the thrrroat. I can almost see the panicked faces of those Yagudo wrrretches.${prompt};If I had my way, you would be permanently stationed in Windurst. However, I know that your adventurer's blood would never allow you to settle down for long.${prompt}
The magic doll...builtaru by Professor Koru-Moru...${prompt};Be sure to come back and visit on occasion, though, and bring us tales and aromas of the new lands you pass through on your travels.${prompt}
Wearing the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}...made by Doctor Shantotto...${prompt};Ah, ${name-player}!
Then have Doctor Yoran-Oran constructaru the seal...${prompt};S-so good to s-see you!${prompt}
Oh, adventurer!;S-so many t-terrible-werrible things were g-going on that we d-didn'taru know about...${prompt}
You've brought all three verses!?${prompt};B-but everyone p-pulled together and s-saved the day! I'm j-just s-speechless!${prompt}
It's time then! I mustaru go to Doctor Yoran-Oran's manor and pick up the finished work.${prompt};Fishing is fun, but I'm a Windurst Woods guard first and foremost! The safety of this city is my top priority!${prompt}
My brother should be waiting in Heavens Tower. Please tell him that I'll be rightaru there!${prompt};Oh, and by the way, I finally learned your name. You're ${name-player}, right?${prompt}
Adventurer! We mustaru hurry to the Full Moon Fountain!${prompt};It could be just my imagination, but I feel like, y'know, all the Mithra in Windurst have finally become united in spirrrit.${prompt}
I have no idea what's going to happen, so we should be prepared for the doom-gloomiest worst. It may come down to a battle with the Bearer of Darkness!${prompt};I also feel that we've become, like, buddies with all the little Tarutaru. And you, of course, ${name-player}. You're, like, my hero!${prompt}
You have done your utmost for Windurst these many months. As the Captain of the Windurst Woods guards, I formally extend to you our gratitude and friendship.${prompt};I still can'taru believe it. Everything that happened at the Full Moon Fountain seems so surrealy-weal.${prompt}
If I had my way, you would be permanently stationed in Windurst. However, I know that your adventurer's blood would never allow you to settle down for long.${prompt};It was so scary-wary, and so heartbreakingly sad. But both my brother and the Star Sibyl have come back to us safely.${prompt}
Be sure to come back and visit on occasion, though, and bring us tales and aromas of the new lands you pass through on your travels.${prompt};There was nothing I could've done by myselfily-welfily, but with everybody's help, we've broughtaru the light back to Windurst!${prompt}
Ah, ${name-player}!;Thank you, everyone!
S-so good to s-see you!${prompt};I'm going to work even harder to make the world a better place for everybody to live in.${prompt}
S-so many t-terrible-werrible things were g-going on that we d-didn'taru know about...${prompt};Minister Apururu is still studying the Cardians builty by her father, Zonpa-Zippa.${prompt}
B-but everyone p-pulled together and s-saved the day! I'm j-just s-speechless!${prompt};With all the queasy-weasy experiments detailed in the previous minister's notes, though, I don'taru thinky Minister Apururu really wants to read through them...${prompt}

Oh, and by the way, I finally learned your name. You're ${name-player}, right?${prompt};Many Cardians died willingly for the sakey-wake of their king, the Cardian Joker.${prompt}
It could be just my imagination, but I feel like, y'know, all the Mithra in Windurst have finally become united in spirrrit.${prompt};Former minister Zonpa-Zippa loved to build in those sorts of tragic loyalties... He probably put in a self-destructaru mechanism, too.${prompt}
I also feel that we've become, like, buddies with all the little Tarutaru. And you, of course, ${name-player}. You're, like, my hero!${prompt};The ring of the Manustery has finally-winally made its way back to the hand of Minister Apururu. Now I can make new and improved Cardian-wardians!${prompt}

It was so scary-wary, and so heartbreakingly sad. But both my brother and the Star Sibyl have come back to us safely.${prompt};It has rrreturned. The great power that belongs to this land...${prompt}
There was nothing I could've done by myselfily-welfily, but with everybody's help, we've broughtaru the light back to Windurst!${prompt};I have come to realize that the world exists to help us find a way to bridge the gaps between the races.${prompt}

The ring of the Manustery has finally-winally made its way back to the hand of Minister Apururu.

Flamme.;The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt}
Match score.;If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt}
Petras and quarrying.;Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt}
Sprint.;You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt}
KO.;No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt}
Return.${prompt};The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt}
The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt};Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}
First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt};“LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt};A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt};The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt};If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt};After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt};Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt};In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt};Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt};Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}
The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt};However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}
Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt};${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}

A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt};The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}
The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt};In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt};In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt};I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}
Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt};You wish to hear of Al'Taieu, adventurer?${prompt}
In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt};A moment.
Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt};To ask questions in such a blunt manner does not befit a ${choice: 0}[lady/gentleman].${prompt}
Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt};My most humble apologies for the intrusion, Chieftainness Perih Vashai.${prompt}
However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt};My name is Louverance N Mistalle.
${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt};To save the people of Vana'diel, I seek the truth that hides behind the veil of history.${prompt}
Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt};A time of apocalypse is at hand.
The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt};I beg you for the guiding knowledge of ages, passed down through the Mithran race...${prompt}
In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt};I understand your situation.
In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt};However, I know nothing of the city painted in that picture.${prompt}
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt};Even if you were to ask the Mithran Trrrackers, I doubt they would have an answer for you.
You wish to hear of Al'Taieu, adventurer?${prompt};They are on a journey to fulfill an important duty.${prompt}
A moment.;...?
To ask questions in such a blunt manner does not befit a ${choice: 0}[lady/gentleman].${prompt};If I may be so bold, are the Mithran Trackers following the scent of some grave crime?${prompt}
My most humble apologies for the intrusion, Chieftainness Perih Vashai.${prompt};Yes. They came to demand atonement for the sins of the Tavnazian cardinal.${prompt}
My name is Louverance N Mistalle.;The cardinal?
To save the people of Vana'diel, I seek the truth that hides behind the veil of history.${prompt};What crime could she have committed?${prompt}
A time of apocalypse is at hand.;Strrrangely enough, her sins are related to the picture you speak of.${prompt}
I beg you for the guiding knowledge of ages, passed down through the Mithran race...${prompt};That picture was stolen from the Temple of Uggalepih.${prompt}
I understand your situation.;A Mithran Trrracker traveled to Tavnazia to recover it, but was instead presented with a deal by the cardinal.${prompt}
However, I know nothing of the city painted in that picture.${prompt};A deal?${prompt}
Even if you were to ask the Mithran Trrrackers, I doubt they would have an answer for you.;The cardinal apparently knew everything about the legend rrrecited by the Mithra, and the duty that it entails.${prompt}
They are on a journey to fulfill an important duty.${prompt};She also stated that the means to carry out that duty had been prepared in Tavnazia.${prompt}
...?;The trrracker had no choice but to accept the deal.
If I may be so bold, are the Mithran Trackers following the scent of some grave crime?${prompt};The fate of Vana'diel's people was placed in the hands of the cardinal.${prompt}
Yes. They came to demand atonement for the sins of the Tavnazian cardinal.${prompt};Chieftainness, indulge me if you will.${prompt}
The cardinal?;What is this legend, and what of the duty it reveals?
What crime could she have committed?${prompt};What had your people intended to do?${prompt}
Strrrangely enough, her sins are related to the picture you speak of.${prompt};That duty was given to the Mithra by the ancient race depicted in the picture.
That picture was stolen from the Temple of Uggalepih.${prompt};A duty to awaken the sleeping gods...${prompt}
A Mithran Trrracker traveled to Tavnazia to recover it, but was instead presented with a deal by the cardinal.${prompt};The sleeping gods...!?${prompt}
A deal?${prompt};Surely you have heard the tale of the ancient rrrace that wounded Vana'diel by opening the Gates of Paradise?${prompt}
The cardinal apparently knew everything about the legend rrrecited by the Mithra, and the duty that it entails.${prompt};The Emptiness that poured from that wound tried to swallow everything in its path: the mountains, the seas, the skies, the forests, even life itself.${prompt}
She also stated that the means to carry out that duty had been prepared in Tavnazia.${prompt};The living beings of Vana'diel decided to use the tears that Altana had shed to cleanse the world.${prompt}
The trrracker had no choice but to accept the deal.;However, a battle erupted between the king of people and the king of dragons over the fifth tear. A conflict that knew no end...${prompt}
The fate of Vana'diel's people was placed in the hands of the cardinal.${prompt};The people that survived used the power of the sleeping gods to heal the wounded land.${prompt}
Chieftainness, indulge me if you will.${prompt};And that is the legend told by the Mithra?${prompt}
What is this legend, and what of the duty it reveals?;Adventurer.
What had your people intended to do?${prompt};In your trrravels you would have seen the giant, glowing crystals that lie hidden far away from civilization.${prompt}
That duty was given to the Mithra by the ancient race depicted in the picture.;Those crystals are the rrresting places of the gods.${prompt}
A duty to awaken the sleeping gods...${prompt};Slumbering within are the immortal beings who were called forth to heal the land in the age of legend.${prompt}
The sleeping gods...!?${prompt};The wounded land of Vana'diel bleeds forth dreaded Emptiness...${prompt}
Surely you have heard the tale of the ancient rrrace that wounded Vana'diel by opening the Gates of Paradise?${prompt};It is now time for us to awaken the sleeping deities, and mend our sufferrring world.${prompt}
The Emptiness that poured from that wound tried to swallow everything in its path: the mountains, the seas, the skies, the forests, even life itself.${prompt};And this is the role that the cardinal attempted to fill?
The living beings of Vana'diel decided to use the tears that Altana had shed to cleanse the world.${prompt};But how...?${prompt}
However, a battle erupted between the king of people and the king of dragons over the fifth tear. A conflict that knew no end...${prompt};That has not yet been rrrevealed to me.${prompt}
The people that survived used the power of the sleeping gods to heal the wounded land.${prompt};But if you must learn the answer to that question, you should ask the Tavnazian theologian who was a survivor of the Great War.${prompt}
And that is the legend told by the Mithra?${prompt};Before she is punished for that crrrime...${prompt}
Adventurer.;...!${prompt}
In your trrravels you would have seen the giant, glowing crystals that lie hidden far away from civilization.${prompt};Do you need further explanation?
Those crystals are the rrresting places of the gods.${prompt};The Mithran sin hunters never forgive a crime.
Slumbering within are the immortal beings who were called forth to heal the land in the age of legend.${prompt};The sin does not die with the sinner.${prompt}
The wounded land of Vana'diel bleeds forth dreaded Emptiness...${prompt};Be careful with your actions.
It is now time for us to awaken the sleeping deities, and mend our sufferrring world.${prompt};It is not our place to judge your sins, but in time, your sins may come to judge you.${prompt}
And this is the role that the cardinal attempted to fill?;What do you make of her words, ${name-player}?${prompt}
But how...?${prompt};The theology of the Mithra veers quite dramatically from that of the San d'Orian Cathedral in several respects.${prompt}
That has not yet been rrrevealed to me.${prompt};The legend concerning the five tears of Altana is especially at odds with what the Elvaan believe...${prompt}
But if you must learn the answer to that question, you should ask the Tavnazian theologian who was a survivor of the Great War.${prompt};That is why I warn you not to swallow her tale without question.${prompt}
Before she is punished for that crrrime...${prompt};Talk of legends aside, the chieftainness's description of the Emptiness that has appeared in every corner of Vana'diel is an indisputable truth.${prompt}
...!${prompt};However, the Mithran Trackers are now chasing after the theologian, Prishe, and not Cardinal Mildaurion.${prompt}
Do you need further explanation?;Which would mean that even the trackers were unable to locate the whereabouts of the cardinal.${prompt}
The Mithran sin hunters never forgive a crime.;Does this mean that the cardinal has already bid farewell to this world?${prompt}
The sin does not die with the sinner.${prompt};Has my astonishing luck finally failed me...?${prompt}
Be careful with your actions.;It is nice to see you after so long, sir.
It is not our place to judge your sins, but in time, your sins may come to judge you.${prompt};I wonder if you remember old Honoi-Gomoi?${prompt}
What do you make of her words, ${name-player}?${prompt};I thought you might have informed me of your presence.
The theology of the Mithra veers quite dramatically from that of the San d'Orian Cathedral in several respects.${prompt};I was mightaruly surprised to hear that you were in town.${prompt}
The legend concerning the five tears of Altana is especially at odds with what the Elvaan believe...${prompt};As always, your visits cause quite a stir...${prompt}
That is why I warn you not to swallow her tale without question.${prompt};...${prompt}
Talk of legends aside, the chieftainness's description of the Emptiness that has appeared in every corner of Vana'diel is an indisputable truth.${prompt};But I do babble-wabble on.
However, the Mithran Trackers are now chasing after the theologian, Prishe, and not Cardinal Mildaurion.${prompt};Your subordinates bade me pass this on to you.${prompt}

You're not finished with the chocolate yet, are you?;Kupopopo～!

Here you go, kupo!${prompt};Les mogs nomades ont également développé une magie qui annulera cette aura anti-attaque, alors assurez-vous de leur rendre visite tout en portant l'arme avant d'affronter l'ennemi, kupo.${prompt}
Come again and bring your friends! Each of them will also get an item, kupo!${prompt};Mais attention, cette magie a pour effet secondaire de vous empêcher d'attaquer tout autre monstre pendant trois jours entiers, kupo !${prompt}
You can get items only once each day, so come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt};Voici votre ${item-singular: 0[2]}.
You obtain ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 0[2]}, ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 1[2]}, ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 2[2]}, and ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 3[2]}!${prompt};Maintenant, vous êtes prêt pour le combat, kupo !${prompt}
Kupopopo～!;Si vous voulez croiser le fer avec les intrus invincibles, équipez-vous de la ${item-singular: 0[2]} et parlez à un mog nomade, kupo !${prompt}
This is terrible!;Kupopo !
Sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords, kupo!${prompt};L'événement principal du Festival de la Brise Solaire est de retour, et mieux que jamais !${prompt}
The villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt};Et cette fois, il s'appelle Cercle Azimuth...II !${prompt}
But never fear!;Voulez-vous en savoir plus, kupo ?${prompt}
Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans!;Vous voulez en savoir plus ?
Behold the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]}, kupo!${prompt};${selection-lines}
The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt};Raconte-moi tout !
But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!${prompt};Ça ira pour l'instant, kupo.${prompt}
Here's your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;Pour jouer à Cercle Azimuth II, vous devrez faire équipe avec un partenaire et utiliser une boussole pour chercher un point spécifique.${prompt}
Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt};Donc, votre première étape est de trouver cette personne spéciale et de former une équipe !${prompt}
If you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt};Ensuite, parlez à un mog de l'événement, et nous vous enverrons tous les deux hors de la ville, kupo !${prompt}
Kupopo!;Nous avons mis en place plusieurs points de contrôle à l'extérieur.${prompt}
The Sunbreeze Festival's main event is back and better than ever!${prompt};Le but est de trouver le bon, kupo !${prompt}
And this time, it's called Azimuth Circle...II!${prompt};Quoi ? Vous voulez un indice pour vous aider à trouver votre point de contrôle ? Ne craignez rien, kupo, c'est là que la boussole portable d'Azima entre en jeu !${prompt}
Would you like to know more, kupo?${prompt};Et c'est très facile à utiliser ! Tout ce que les aventuriers ont à faire est de s'asseoir et d'attendre !${prompt}
Want to know more?;Une fois la boussole stabilisée, elle vous donnera un indice pour vous aider à trouver le point de contrôle de votre partenaire, kupo.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Mais faites attention à ne pas trop vous détendre ! Juste s'asseoir et regarder les nuages ne vous aidera pas du tout, kupo. Vous devez vous concentrer comme vous le faites lorsque vous guérissez vos blessures !${prompt}
Fill me in!;Et gardez à l'esprit que vous n'apprendrez que des informations sur le point de contrôle de votre partenaire.${prompt}
I'm okay for now, kupo.${prompt};Alors aidez-vous mutuellement et rien ne devrait mal tourner !${prompt}
To play Azimuth Circle II, you'll need to team up with a partner and use a compass to search for a specific point.${prompt};Une fois que vous avez atteint votre point de contrôle, vous devriez y trouver quelque chose d'enfoui qui prouvera que vous y êtes arrivé ! Vous et votre partenaire devriez échanger vos objets entre vous, puis les remettre à un mog, kupo !${prompt}
So your first step is to find that special somebody and form a party!${prompt};C'est tout ce qu'il y a à faire, kupo ! Vous recevrez un prix si vous réussissez, alors j'espère que vous ferez de votre mieux !${prompt}
Then talk to an event moogle, and we'll send you both out of town, kupo!${prompt};Vous aurez besoin d'un partenaire, alors revenez quand vous en aurez un !${prompt}
We've set up several checkpoints outside.${prompt};Trois, c'est une foule, kupo ! Je cherche des équipes de deux, pas plus !${prompt}
The goal is to find the correct one, kupo!${prompt};Voulez-vous sortir et essayer l'événement avec la personne avec qui vous êtes en équipe maintenant ?${prompt}
What's that? You want a hint to help you find your checkpoint? Never fear, kupo--that's where Azima's portable compass comes in!${prompt};Est-ce que ce partenaire vous convient ?
And it couldn't be easier to use! All the adventurers have to do is sit there and wait!${prompt};${selection-lines}
Once the compass has stabilized, it will give you a hint to help you find your partner's checkpoint, kupo.${prompt};Parfait !
But be careful not to relax too much! Just sitting there staring at the clouds won't help you at all, kupo. You have to concentrate the way you do when healing your wounds!${prompt};Je veux aller avec quelqu'un d'autre...${prompt}
And keep in mind that you will only learn about your partner's checkpoint.${prompt};Revenez quand vous aurez décidé d'un partenaire, kupo !${prompt}
So help each other out and nothing should go wrong!${prompt};Kupo ?
Once you reach your checkpoint, you should find something buried there that will prove that you made it! You and your partner should trade your items with each other and then hand them to a moogle, kupo!${prompt};Où est passé votre partenaire ?${prompt}
That's all there is to it, kupo! You'll get a prize if you succeed, so I hope you do well!${prompt};J'espère que vous apprécierez l'événement ensemble, kupo ! Quand vous serez tous les deux prêts, parlez simplement à l'un de nous, les mogs, pour commencer !${prompt}
You'll need a partner, so come back when you have one!${prompt};J'attendrai ici, alors faites-le moi savoir quand vous serez prêts, kupo.${prompt}
Three makes a crowd, kupo! I'm looking for parties of two, and no more!${prompt};Kupopo ! Félicitations !
Do you want to go outside and try the event with the person you're in a party with now?${prompt};Vous étiez merveilleux ensemble ! C'est tout à vous maintenant, kupo...${prompt}
Is this partner okay with you?;Kupo ? Ce n'est pas l'objet de votre partenaire ! Échangez d'abord avec votre partenaire, et donnez-moi son objet !${prompt}
${selection-lines};Nous attendons juste votre partenaire maintenant, kupo ! Ou voudriez-vous annuler votre participation ?${prompt}
Perfect!;Votre partenaire n'est pas encore prêt, kupo. Mais j'attendrai.${prompt}
I want to go with someone else...${prompt};Il semble que votre partenaire ne veuille pas encore y aller. Faites-le moi savoir quand il sera prêt, kupo.${prompt}
Come back when you've decided on a partner, kupo!${prompt};Êtes-vous prêts maintenant, kupo ?${prompt}
Kupo?;Quitter la ville ?
Where'd your partner go?${prompt};${selection-lines}
I hope you enjoy the event together, kupo! When both of you are ready, just talk to one of us moogles to start!${prompt};Envoyez-moi dehors !
I'll be waiting here, so just let me know when you're prepared, kupo.${prompt};Pas encore...${prompt}
Kupopo! Congratulations!;Oh, vous portez tous les deux des yukata ! Vous devez être prêts pour un vrai défi, kupo ! Ne vous inquiétez pas, cependant, le prix en vaut la peine !${prompt}
You were wonderful together! This is all yours now, kupo...${prompt};Kupo ? Ce n'est pas le partenaire que vous aviez avant ! Changer de partenaire en cours de jeu est contre les règles, kupo.${prompt}
Kupo? This isn't your partner's item! Trade with your partner first, and give their item to me!${prompt};Si vous voulez jouer avec une autre personne, vous devriez parler à l'un de nous, les mogs, et recommencer le jeu !${prompt}
We're just waiting on your partner now, kupo! Or would you like to cancel your participation?${prompt};Je ne peux donner à chaque personne qu'un seul objet par jour !${prompt}
Your partner isn't ready yet, kupo. I'll wait, though.${prompt};Plus tard, je vérifierai que vous avez tous les deux trouvé vos points de contrôle. Je vous donnerai aussi ce glyphe de porte pour que vous puissiez retourner en ville, kupo !${prompt}
It looks like your partner doesn't want to go yet. Just let me know when your partner is ready, kupo.${prompt};Kupo ? Vous avez déjà ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...${prompt}
Are you ready now, kupo?${prompt};Kupo ! J'ai presque oublié la chose la plus importante de toutes ! Tenez, prenez ceci !${prompt}
Leave town?;${color-alt: 15}Le mog donne à ${name-player} une petite boussole faite d’un minerai scintillant.
${selection-lines};Si vous parvenez tous les deux à trouver vos points de contrôle, je vous donnerai une récompense... Alors faites de votre mieux, kupo ! ${prompt}
Send me out!;Quoi ? Vous avez trouvé une poupée, kupo ? Alors échangez-la avec votre partenaire et donnez-la à l'un de nous, les mogs !${prompt}
Not yet...${prompt};Désolé, mais si vous n'atteignez pas le point de contrôle vous-même, je ne peux pas donner de récompense, kupo...${prompt}
Oh, you're both wearing yukata! You must be ready for a real challenge, kupo! Don't worry, though--the prize is worth it!${prompt};On dirait que vous n'avez pas réussi... Bonne chance la prochaine fois, d'accord, kupo ? Je vais reprendre la boussole maintenant...${prompt}
Kupo? That's not the partner you were with before! Changing partners in the middle of the game is against the rules, kupo.${prompt};Bonne chance la prochaine fois, d'accord, kupo ? Je vais reprendre la boussole maintenant...${prompt}
If you want to play with a different person, you should talk to one of us moogles and start the game over!${prompt};${color-alt: 15}${name-player} rend la boussole au mog.
I can only give each person one item a day!${prompt};Vous savez maintenant quoi faire : relevez-vous et essayez à nouveau ! Faites-le moi savoir si vous vous sentez prêts, kupo.${prompt}
Later, I'll check to make sure you both found your checkpoints. I'll also give you this gate glyph so you can return to town, kupo!${prompt};Que se passe-t-il ? Voulez-vous recommencer ?${prompt}
Kupo? You already have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...${prompt};Recommencer ?
Kupo! I almost forgot the most important thing of all! Here, take this!${prompt};${selection-lines}
${color-alt: 15}The moogle hands ${name-player} a small compass made from scintillant ore.;Oui, s'il vous plaît.
If you both manage to find your checkpoints, I'll give you a reward... So do your best, kupo! ${prompt};Non, merci.${prompt}
What? You found a doll, kupo? Then trade it with your partner and give it to one of us moogles!${prompt};Répandez-vous la joie parmi les enfants de Vana'diel ?
Sorry, but if you don't reach the checkpoint yourself, I can't give out a reward, kupo...${prompt};Hé, je peux vous dire quelque chose que vous devriez savoir !${prompt}
Looks like you weren't successful... Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...${prompt};Écoutez bien ! Pour rendre les enfants heureux, vous devez... leur offrir des cadeaux !
Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...${prompt};Vous devriez bien réfléchir à ce que vous allez leur donner ! On dit que c'est l'intention qui compte, mais malheureusement, les enfants pensent autrement !${prompt}
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} returns the compass to the moogle.;Vous devriez aussi porter un chapeau rouge comme celui que je porte maintenant ! Cela prouvera que vous êtes un joyeux dispensateur, alors les enfants ne penseront pas que vous êtes un creep.${prompt}
You know what to do now--get right back on your feet and try again! Just let me know if you're feeling up for it, kupo.${prompt};Où pouvez-vous trouver un chapeau ? Eh bien, j'ai vu quelqu'un en vendre par ici plus tôt. Je suis sûr que vous pouvez les trouver si vous cherchez !${prompt}
What is it? Do you want to start over?${prompt};${choice: 1}[Vous n’avez apporté aucun bonheur aux enfants !/Vous avez fait du bon travail./Vous avez fait plutôt bien./Vous avez donné beaucoup de joie aux enfants !/Vous avez apporté sourire après sourire aux enfants !/Vous avez les enfants éclatant de joie !/Les enfants vous adorent !] ${choice: 1}[Quelle déception./Il vous suffit de faire un petit effort supplémentaire !/Continuez comme ça !/Vous faites un bon dispensateur de sourires./Excellent travail !/Travail stupéfiant !/Même moi, je vous trouve génial !]${prompt}
Start over?;Vous pouvez faire bon usage de la joie que vous avez apportée pour vous transporter dans une autre nation. Les enfants d'autres régions de Vana'diel ont aussi besoin de sourires !${prompt}
${selection-lines};Se transporter dans une autre nation ?
Yes, please.;${selection-lines}
No thanks.${prompt};Pas maintenant.
Are you spreading joy to the children of Vana'diel?;Aller à San d'Oria.
Hey, I can tell you something you should know!${prompt};Aller à Bastok.
Listen close, now! To make the children happy you must...give them presents!;Aller à Windurst.${prompt}
You should think hard about what to get them! You might say it's the thought that counts, but unfortunately, the children think otherwise!${prompt};À plus !${prompt}
You should also wear a red hat like the one I have on now! It'll prove you're a smilebringer, so the kids won't think you're a creep.${prompt};Désolé, mais il semble que vous n'ayez pas assez de joie et de bonheur dans votre vie pour faire cela. Vous pouvez en gagner en offrant des cadeaux aux enfants, cependant !${prompt}
Where can you find a hat? Well, I saw someone selling them around here earlier. I'm sure you can find them if you look!${prompt};Laissez-nous ce tas de bois de chauffage futur, kupo ! Tout ce dont nous avons besoin de votre part, c’est de quelques ${color: 5}acclamations${color: 1} !${prompt}
${choice: 1}[You haven't brought any happiness to the children!/You've done some good./You have done fairly well./You have given the children much joy!/You have brought smile upon smile to the children!/You have the children bursting with glee!/The children love you!] ${choice: 1}[What a disappointment./You just need to give a little extra effort!/Keep it up!/You make a good smilebringer./Excellent work!/Stupendous job!/Even I think you're great!]${prompt};Nous devons chasser ce monstre hors de la ville, kupo ! Les mogs feront tout le travail. Tout ce que vous avez à faire, c’est de nous ${color: 5}encourager${color: 1} !${prompt}
You can make good use of some of that joy you've brought to transport yourself to another nation. The children in other parts of Vana'diel need smiles, too!${prompt};Méchant arbre ! Méchant arbre !
Transport to another nation?;Merci, tout le monde !
${selection-lines};Continuez comme ça et il n'y a aucun moyen que nous perdions, kupo !${prompt}
Not now.;10000... 15000... 30000 !
Go to San d'Oria.;L'arbre gagne trop de puissance ! Cela ne semble pas bon, kupo !${prompt}
Go to Bastok.;Unnnnnngh... Méchant arbre !
Go to Windurst.${prompt};Nous ne vous laisserons pas entraver nos plans cette fois-ci, kupo !${prompt}
See ya!${prompt};Nnngahhh, kupo! Je ne peux pas le retenir!${prompt}
Sorry, but it looks like you don't have enough joy and happiness in your life to do that. You can earn some by giving presents to children, though!${prompt};Le Treant Scintillant verse une larme solitaire en disparaissant dans le néant...${prompt}
Leave this heap of future firewood to us, kupo! All we need from you is a couple ${color: 5}cheers${color: 1}!${prompt};Eh bien, c'était intéressant. Qui aurait pensé qu'un de nos arbres de festival se mettrait à marcher? Je suis juste content que ce soit fini.${prompt}
We have to run this monster out of town, kupo! The moogles will do all the work. All you have to do is ${color: 5}cheer${color: 1} us along!${prompt};Cependant, il y a quelque chose qui me dérange toujours... C'est comme un nuage sombre qui plane au-dessus de notre belle ville...${prompt}
Bad tree! Bad tree!;"J'ai été tellement occupé à combattre les treants et à répandre l'amour auprès des enfants que ce n'est que récemment que j'ai entendu les rumeurs des ""autres"" apporteurs de sourires...${prompt}"
Thanks, everybody!;Je ne sais pas ce que ces imposteurs mijotent, mais s'ils pensent ne serait-ce qu'à toucher aux enfants innocents de la ville...${prompt}
Keep it up and there's no way we can lose, kupo!${prompt};Je déteste demander cela à un étranger, mais vous avez l'air d'être quelqu'un en qui je peux avoir confiance. Pourriez-vous avoir la gentillesse de rechercher le faux apporteur de sourires et de me l'amener pour que nous puissions régler toute cette histoire?${prompt}
10000... 15000... 30000!;Vous êtes de retour ! Avez-vous pu trouver l'imposteur?${prompt}
The tree is gaining too much power! This doesn't look good, kupo!${prompt};Vous l'avez localisé, mais il a réussi à s'échapper? Eh bien, je suppose que c'est mieux que rien. Maintenant qu'il sait que nous sommes sur ses traces, peut-être qu'il cessera de s'en prendre aux enfants du Royaume.${prompt}
Unnnnnngh... Bad tree!;J'ai entendu d'un autre aimable aventurier que le faux apporteur de sourires distribuait des boîtes étranges aux jeunes... Pourquoi, pour tout ce que je sais, il pourrait y avoir des scorpions vivants cachés dans ces paquets, juste en attente de piquer les petits bouts de nez de tous mes petits amis.${prompt}
We won't let you get in the way of our plans this time, kupo!${prompt};Vous ne savez pas à quel point votre gentillesse signifie pour moi. Vous êtes un peu trop vieux pour être mon ami, mais j'aimerais que vous ayez ceci en signe de mon appréciation.${prompt}
Nnngahhh, kupo! I can't hold him back!${prompt};Wow! C'était plutôt effrayant. Je suis tout pour les droits des arbres et tout ça, mais une fois que ces gars-là commencent à se promener dans ma ville...${prompt}
The Twinkling Treant sheds a solitary tear as it fades into nothingness...${prompt};Coupez-les en morceaux et jetez-les sur le feu de camp, c'est ce que je dis. Le seul bon arbre est celui qui fait griller mon marshmallow.${prompt}
Well, that was interesting. Who would have thought that one of our festival trees would just get up and start walking around? I'm just glad that it is all over.${prompt};Oh oui, je voulais vous demander quelque chose avant que vous ne m'interrompiez.${prompt}
However, there is something that still bothers me... It is like a dark cloud hanging over our fair city...${prompt};Il y a ces étranges nains qui courent en ville en prétendant qu'ils sont des apporteurs de sourires comme moi.${prompt}
I've been so busy fighting treants and spreading love to the children, that it wasn't until recently that I heard the rumors of the “other” smilebringers...${prompt};J'ai eu les mains tellement pleines à courir après les arbres ambulants que je n'ai pas pu enquêter. Pour compenser le fait de m'avoir interrompu, pourriez-vous aller voir si vous pouvez trouver des informations juteuses sur les faux?${prompt}
I don't know what these imposters are cooking up, but if they are even thinking of laying a finger on the city's innocent children...${prompt};Je serai juste ici à protéger la fontaine contre d'autres attaques de treants. Faites-le moi savoir dès que vous aurez appris quelque chose d'utile.${prompt}
I hate to ask this of a stranger, but you look like someone I can trust. Would you please be so kind as to search out the false smilebringer and bring him to me so we can straighten this whole mess out?${prompt};Qui est-tu, kewpo ?
You're back! Were you able to find the imposter?${prompt};Je ne fais rien de mal ici, tu vois ? J'apporte des sourires aux gentils garçons et filles, kewpo ! Passe ton chemin ! Passe ton chemin !${prompt}
You located him, but he managed to escape? Well, I guess that is better than nothing. Now that he knows we are on to him, perhaps he will cease to prey on the Kingdom's children.${prompt};Ummm...
I heard from another kind adventurer that the false smilebringer was passing out strange-looking boxes to the young ones... Why, for all I know, there could be live scorpions hiding in those packages, just waiting to sting the cute little button noses of all my little friends.${prompt};Je peux expliquer, kewpo...${prompt}
You don't know how much your kindness means to me. You're a little old to be my friend, but I'd like you to have this as a token of my appreciation.${prompt};Juste pas aujourd'hui !
Wow! That was pretty frightening. I'm all for tree's rights and everything, but once those guys start walking around my town...${prompt};Kew-pooooooooo !${prompt}
Chop 'em up and toss them on the campfire, that's what I say. The only good tree is the one toasting my marshmallow.${prompt};De retour enfin. Avez-vous appris quelque chose qui vaille la peine de partager mon attention partiellement divisée?${prompt}
Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you something before you interrupted me there.${prompt};Uh-huh...
There are these strange midgets running around town claiming that they're smilebringers just like me.${prompt};Donc vous l'avez laissé s'échapper... Eh bien, je suppose que c'est ce que je mérite pour avoir fait confiance à un amateur. Ma faute, ma faute.${prompt}
I've had my hands so full chasing around the walking trees that I haven't been able to investigate. How about to make up for interrupting me back there, you go and see if you can find any juicy info on the fakes?${prompt};Un de mes autres contacts m'a dit que le petit gars distribuait une sorte de pâtisserie étrange à tous les enfants. Jusqu'à présent, je n'ai pas entendu parler de cas de diarrhée, mais la journée est encore jeune.${prompt}
I'll be right here protecting the fountain from any more treant attacks. Let me know the moment you've learned something worthwhile.${prompt};Je suppose que le fait de l'avoir effrayé mettra fin à ce fiasco, mais nous ne pouvons pas en être sûrs à cent pour cent. Gardez un œil sur ce fléau et la prochaine fois, ne le laissez pas s'échapper !${prompt}
Who the kewpo are you, kewpo?;Quoi ?
I'm nothing doing wrong here, see? I'm smilebringing to nice boys and girls, kewpo! Move along! Move along!${prompt};Vous voulez quelque chose pour m'avoir aidé ? Eh bien, c'est la célébration de la Starlight. Pourquoi pas ? Vous ne récoltez que ce que vous semez, non ?${prompt}
Ummm...;Arrrg, cet arbre ambulant a failli marcher sur moi et mon perroquet ! Un pas de plus et je me faisais une nouvelle jambe de bois avec sa tête.${prompt}
I can explaining, kewpo...${prompt};Oui, parlant de jambes de bois, il y a ce drôle de loustic qui rôde à Windurst en prétendant être un apporteur de sourires. Qu'est-ce que ça a à voir avec les jambes de bois ? Arrrg, ne t'en soucie pas.${prompt}
Just not today!;Tu n'as qu'à te soucier du fait que cet imposteur empiète sur mon territoire${prompt}
Kew-pooooooooo!${prompt};Personne, même pas Davy Jones, n'a le droit de jeter l'ancre dans mon port sans ma permission expresse.${prompt}
Back at last. Did you learn anything worth my partially divided attention?${prompt};Arrrg, tu as l'air d'une âme digne de confiance. Pourrais-tu trouver en ton cœur d'aider un pirate en détresse ?${prompt}
Uh-huh...;J'ai un mauvais pressentiment au sujet de cet arbre, et je veux être là si quelque chose tourne mal.${prompt}
So you let the thing get away... Well, I guess that's what I get for relying on an amateur. My bad, my bad.${prompt};Arrrg, as-tu trouvé ce scélérat et l'as-tu fait marcher sur la planche?${prompt}
One of my other contacts told me that the little spud was passing out some strange kind of pastry to all the kids. So far I haven't heard of any diarrhea breakouts, but the day is still young.${prompt};Tu dis qu'il a juste disparu, hein ? Eh bien, je suppose que tu n'es pas à blâmer.${prompt}
I guess your scaring him off will put an end to this fiasco, but we can't be one hundred percent sure. Keep your eyes out for that pest and next time don't let him escape!${prompt};Un de mes autres matelots a dit qu'ils ont vu le faux apporteur de sourires se promener comme une marionnette et distribuer des cadeaux étranges aux enfants.${prompt}
What?;Mais maintenant que tu l'as effrayé, la ville devrait être en sécurité.
You want something for helping me out? Well, it is the Starlight Celebration. Why not? You only get what you give, right?${prompt};Tiens, prends ce butin. Tu l'as bien mérité, matelot !${prompt}
Arrrg, that there walkin' tree almost stepped on me and me parrot! One step closer and I'd be makin' meself a new peg leg out of its head.${prompt};Kupopopo～ !
Aye, speakin' o' peg legs, there be this mighty fishy landlubber swaggerin' 'round Windurs' posin' as a smilebringer. What's that got t' do with peg legs? Arrrg, never ye mind.${prompt};C'est terrible !
Ye only needs t' concern yerself with the fact that this imposter is encroachin' on me territory${prompt};Quelques crapules sournoises ont encore volé les armures que nous avions apportées pour la Fête des Épées... kupo !${prompt}
Nobody, not even Davy Jones, has the right t' drop his anchor in me harbor without me express permission.${prompt};Comme vous le savez probablement, les bandits qui portent ces armures sont invulnérables aux armes normales ! Et comme si ça ne suffisait pas, ils sont entourés d'une puissante aura qui les rend intouchables, kupo !${prompt}
Arrrg, ye looks like a trustworthy soul. Could ye find it in yer heart t' help out a fellow pirate in need?${prompt};Mais ne vous inquiétez pas !
I've got a bad feelin' 'bout that tree, an' I want t' be 'round if anythin' goes awry.${prompt};Les moogles nomades ont aussi développé une magie qui annulera cette aura anti-attaque. Assurez-vous de leur rendre visite tout en portant l'arme avant d'affronter l'ennemi, kupo.${prompt}
Arrrg, did ye find that scurvy dawg an' make 'im walk the plank?${prompt};Mais attention -- cette magie a pour effet secondaire de vous empêcher d'attaquer tout autre monstre pendant trois jours vana'dieliens entiers, kupo !${prompt}
Ye say he just up an' vanished, now do ye? Well, I guess yer not t' blame.${prompt};Et ce n'est pas tout !
One of me other mateys said they saw the rotten bringer prancin' round like a puppet an' passin' out strange presents t' the kiddies.${prompt};Cette fois, nous voulons nous assurer que ces voleurs misérables auront du mal à revenir, kupo !${prompt}
But now that ye've frightened 'im off, the city should be safe.;Vous voyez, même si vous en abattez un, le pouvoir de l'armure restaurera lentement sa santé, et avant que vous ne le sachiez, le coquin sera de nouveau à plein régime !${prompt}
Here, take this bit o' plunder. Ye've earned it, matey!${prompt};C’est pourquoi nous vous conseillons de planter (${color: 5}échanger${color: 1}) votre ${item-singular: 0[2]} ou votre ${item-singular: 1[2]} près d’un malfrat abattu. Cela créera une protection qui devrait ralentir les propriétés régénératives de l’équipement, vous permettant de les vaincre à répétition, kupo !${prompt}
Kupopopo～!;Souvenez-vous simplement que plus vous vous éloignez de la protection, plus elle s’affaiblit. Nous vous recommandons de rester dans la même ${color: 5}zone${color: 1} pour de meilleurs résultats.${prompt}
This is terrible!;Très bien. Voici votre ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Maintenant, vous êtes prêt pour le combat, kupo !${prompt}
Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!${prompt};Oh, et vous constaterez que les récompenses que nous avons pour vous cette fois-ci sont encore meilleures que les précédentes. Vous pourriez même être l'un des chanceux aventuriers à remporter un tout nouveau et chic... Ah, vous devrez le voir pour le croire, kupo !${prompt}
As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt};Maintenant, si vous voulez croiser le fer avec les intrus invincibles, équipez ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} ou ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} et parlez à un moogle nomade, kupo !${prompt}
But never fear!;Vana'diel est attaquée par des bandits portant nos armures de samouraï volées ! Aidez les moogles de chaque nation à vaincre cette menace, kupo !${prompt}
The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt};Nous avons concocté une magie moogle pour briser cette aura, mais vous devrez équiper une arme spéciale pour au moins leur causer une égratignure, kupo ! Equipez-vous, je vous le dis ! Equiiiip !${prompt}
But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!${prompt};Ce... cet ${item-singular: 0[2]}...
And that's not all!;C'est peut-être exactement ce qu'il faut pour frapper ces samouraïs farfelus ! Tenez-vous tranquille pendant que je fais ma magie moogle, kupo !${prompt}
This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!${prompt};Oh, n’oubliez pas de placer la protection avec votre ${item-singular: 0[2]} une fois que vous en avez abattu un !${prompt}
You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!${prompt};Vous pourrez vraiment blesser ces porteurs de malheur avec ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Allez, tenez-vous tranquille pendant que je fais ma magie moogle, kupo !${prompt}
That's why we want you to plant (${color: 5}trade${color: 1}) your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or ${item-singular: 1[2]} into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment's regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!${prompt};Oh, n’oubliez pas de placer la protection avec votre ${item-singular: 0[2]} ou votre ${item-singular: 1[2]} une fois que vous en avez abattu un !${prompt}
Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same ${color: 5}area${color: 1} for best results.${prompt};"Et quoi que vous fassiez, ne vous éloignez pas trop de la zone ; vos protections fatiguées s’affaibliront, kupo !${prompt}"
Alright. Here's your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt};Non, non, non ! Cet ${item-singular: 1[2]} est beaucoup trop tranchant ! Pensez aux dégâts qu’il pourrait causer à l’armure innocente ! Allez, allez chercher ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} ou ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} et revenez vite, kupo !${prompt}
Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!${prompt};Bien joué !
Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt};Passons au suivant, kupo !${prompt}
Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!${prompt};Ce voleur a déjà été affaibli par une protection. Essayez d'en trouver un qui ne l'ait pas été, kupo !${prompt}
We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!${prompt};Merveilleux ! Voici votre récompense, kupo !
Th-that ${item-singular: 0[2]}...;Si vous êtes toujours partant, pourquoi ne pas sortir et en frapper quelques autres ?${prompt}
It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt};Incroyable ! Maintenant, peut-être que ces commerçants d'Extrême-Orient ne nous mélangeront pas en hachis moogle ! Voici votre récompense, kupo !${prompt}
Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} when you've defeated one!${prompt};J-je suis sans voix ! Nous ne pensions pas que quelqu'un pourrait rivaliser d'ingéniosité avec cette menace mithra ! Voici votre récompense, kupo !${prompt}
You'll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt};L'ombre du voleur plane toujours sur l'armure...${prompt}
Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or your ${item-singular: 1[2]} when you've defeated one!${prompt};L'ombre du voleur a presque disparu complètement.${prompt}
"And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!${prompt}";Hé ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame], arrêtez-vous là !
No, no, no! That ${item-singular: 1[2]} is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and hurry back, kupo!${prompt};Êtes-vous un “aventurier” ?${prompt}
Well done!;Alors, avouez.

Yikes!;Quoi qu’il en soit, il semble qu’ils aient marchandé à la baisse le prix d’un tas de navires désarmés de Bastok pour les utiliser dans le transport de mercenaires vers Aht Urhgan...${prompt}

Anyway, it looks like they've haggled the price down on a bunch of decommissioned ships from Bastok to use in hauling mercenaries off to Aht Urhgan...${prompt};Révélez un secret spécial à tout aventurier que vous rencontrez portant un insigne spécial !${prompt}
Those giantaru scraps of metal could sink any time, not to mention the scores of dangers awaiting on the open seas! The Near East obviously cares nothing for the mercenaries' lives.${prompt};Les “Sentinelles de Salaheem” tant entendues se trouvent dans la ville d'“Al Zahbi” !${prompt}

Are you really willing to give up without even seeing its face one last time?${prompt}
You can send your chocobo to dig for items to benefit the stables. We will thank you for your contribution with a certain amount of gil.${prompt};Fine. Then the stables will raise this egg. Is there anything you wish to say?${prompt}
Digging for items will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};Fine. Custody of this chocobo will be transferred to the stables. Do you have any last words for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt}
Your chocobo can even appear in plays. You will receive payment for this service in gil.${prompt};Fine. When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?${prompt}
Interacting with actors and the audience should improve the chocobo's receptivity, but the difficult practice will place some strain on the animal.${prompt};Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. Sorry...${prompt}
What's that? You want to give up on this egg, do you?${prompt};Is that so? That's a good attitude to have...${prompt}
What's that? You don't want to raise ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} any longer?${prompt};...
Eh? You want to stop raising the poor animal at a time like this?${prompt};I'm disappointed in you.${prompt}
You just started raising the poor creature! You're really sure you want to do this?${prompt};Some excuse... You haven't even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt}
If you decide to quit, you will never see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Is that okay with you?${prompt};No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt}
If you decide to quit, you will never see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Are you really willing to give up without even seeing its face one last time?${prompt};We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse.${prompt}
Fine. Then the stables will raise this egg. Is there anything you wish to say?${prompt};Of course not! Keep up the good work with your chocobo, all right?${prompt}
Fine. Custody of this chocobo will be transferred to the stables. Do you have any last words for ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt}
Fine. When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?${prompt};You really want to retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt}
Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. Sorry...${prompt};Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to see it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?${prompt}
Is that so? That's a good attitude to have...${prompt};Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms.${prompt}
...;Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.${prompt}
I'm disappointed in you.${prompt};Parting with your chocobo is difficult, isn't it? Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Don't look so down.${prompt}
Some excuse... You haven't even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to your chocobo. Don't worry, though...you can see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Don't look so down.${prompt}
No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt}
We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse.${prompt};A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.${prompt}
Of course not! Keep up the good work with your chocobo, all right?${prompt};Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt}
You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
You really want to retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.${prompt}
Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to see it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?${prompt};You can register a retired chocobo by trading ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to me.${prompt}
Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms.${prompt};All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready.${prompt}

Parting with your chocobo is difficult, isn't it? Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Don't look so down.${prompt};I will now register ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} to come when you call.${prompt}
I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to your chocobo. Don't worry, though...you can see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Don't look so down.${prompt};I'll take ${number: 0} gil for the preparations.${prompt}
I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};I've got your ${item-singular: 0[2]} right here. You can have it now.${prompt}
A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.${prompt};You lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}
Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};Well, I guess I'll have to get another one from Hantileon. It's going to cost you ${number: 1} gil, though.${prompt}
You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};This item links you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} together. You would be wise not to lose it again.${prompt}
Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.${prompt};It looks like you're taking good care of this. There seems to be no problem.${prompt}
You can register a retired chocobo by trading ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to me.${prompt};This ${item-singular: 2[2]}'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.${prompt}
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready.${prompt};I can give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for it if you wish.${prompt}
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready as soon as it returns.${prompt};Here you go. Take good care of it.${prompt}
I will now register ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} to come when you call.${prompt};All right... You can have this back, then.${prompt}
I'll take ${number: 0} gil for the preparations.${prompt};Let me give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for this old one.${prompt}
I've got your ${item-singular: 0[2]} right here. You can have it now.${prompt};And don't worry about the usual fee. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is all I need from you this time.${prompt}
You lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};I still haven't given your chocobo it's food, so I will return it to you.${prompt}
Well, I guess I'll have to get another one from Hantileon. It's going to cost you ${number: 1} gil, though.${prompt};Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.${prompt}
This item links you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} together. You would be wise not to lose it again.${prompt};Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.${prompt}
It looks like you're taking good care of this. There seems to be no problem.${prompt};Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.${prompt}
This ${item-singular: 2[2]}'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.${prompt};Alright. Let's give ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} its food.${prompt}
I can give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for it if you wish.${prompt};I hope it gets well soon.${prompt}
Here you go. Take good care of it.${prompt};I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo.${prompt}
All right... You can have this back, then.${prompt};I hope your chocobo awakens soon.${prompt}
Let me give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for this old one.${prompt};Ah, ${name-player}.
And don't worry about the usual fee. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is all I need from you this time.${prompt};I've been waiting for you. You can have this.${prompt}
I still haven't given your chocobo it's food, so I will return it to you.${prompt};To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.${prompt};You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.${prompt}
Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.${prompt};Hello, ${name-player}...
Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.${prompt};What's all this about?${prompt}
Alright. Let's give ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} its food.${prompt};I see...
I hope it gets well soon.${prompt};So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.${prompt}
I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo.${prompt};${name-player}, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.${prompt}
I hope your chocobo awakens soon.${prompt};I'm sure its owner is searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.${prompt}
Ah, ${name-player}.;If you discover anything, have Gonija take down the details.${prompt}
I've been waiting for you. You can have this.${prompt};${name-player}, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I've been collecting information myself, too...${prompt}
To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};The owner's name starts with the letter ${choice: 0}[ / / /D/G/A].${prompt}
You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.${prompt};The owner is ${choice: 0}[ / / / /a Galka/a Hume woman/a Hume man/an old Hume woman].${prompt}
Hello, ${name-player}...;The owner is ${choice: 0}[ /a watchman/ /a merchant/a miner/a guild worker].${prompt}
What's all this about?${prompt};I'll search too when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.${prompt}
I see...;I've found more information on the lost chick's owner.${prompt}
So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.${prompt};That's all I could find. The rest is up to you.${prompt}
${name-player}, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.${prompt};The chick's owner came and picked it up not long ago. I'm glad we found its rightful home.${prompt}
I'm sure its owner is searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.${prompt};I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.${prompt}
If you discover anything, have Gonija take down the details.${prompt};Hmm...
${name-player}, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I've been collecting information myself, too...${prompt};I believe that name violates the VCS naming conventions.
The owner's name starts with the letter ${choice: 0}[ / / /D/G/A].${prompt};You'll need to choose something different, I'm afraid.${prompt}
The owner is ${choice: 0}[ / / / /a Galka/a Hume woman/a Hume man/an old Hume woman].${prompt};Lately, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been crying loud enough at night to wake the dead!${prompt}
The owner is ${choice: 0}[ /a watchman/ /a merchant/a miner/a guild worker].${prompt};I know chicks cry a lot, but this is the worst...${prompt}
I'll search too when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.${prompt};I know! Could you hold on to this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for a while?${prompt}
I've found more information on the lost chick's owner.${prompt};Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.${prompt}
That's all I could find. The rest is up to you.${prompt};That should be enough! Hand over the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} now.${prompt}
The chick's owner came and picked it up not long ago. I'm glad we found its rightful home.${prompt};Hm...yes...${chocobo-name: 0[2]} should be able to sleep well with this...${prompt}
I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.${prompt};Thanks to the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been sleeping like a baby!${prompt}
Hmm...;I haven't seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep better.${prompt}
I believe that name violates the VCS naming conventions.;I'll get rid of this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for you. No need to thank me! I'm just that kind of gal!${prompt}
You'll need to choose something different, I'm afraid.${prompt};${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride!${prompt}
Lately, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been crying loud enough at night to wake the dead!${prompt};${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs!${prompt}

I haven't seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep better.${prompt};I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has never looked better!${prompt}
I'll get rid of this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for you. No need to thank me! I'm just that kind of gal!${prompt};You'll need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in order to call it in the field. Sorry, but you have to go aaall the way to the chocobo stables in San d'Oria to get one!${prompt}
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride!${prompt};You just gave me an egg! I can't take care of two at once!${prompt}
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs!${prompt};I can't take that egg! You're already raising a chocobo!${prompt}
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak!${prompt};I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables!${prompt}
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that graceful plumage!${prompt};So this is the egg you want to raise, is it?${prompt}
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs and fine beak!${prompt};We'll take good care of it, then... This is going to be the greatest chocobo ever!${prompt}

${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs, that fine beak...and what graceful plumage!${prompt};Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause problems when the chocobo matures and it comes time to fill out important paperwork!${prompt}
I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has never looked better!${prompt};Just look at that color! It won't be long until ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is fully grown!${prompt}
You'll need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in order to call it in the field. Sorry, but you have to go aaall the way to the chocobo stables in San d'Oria to get one!${prompt};And I must say, your bird seems quite energetic. Quite more than usual, in fact.${prompt}
You just gave me an egg! I can't take care of two at once!${prompt};You did a really super job raising this chocobo! Now is the best time to improve its attributes.${prompt}
I can't take that egg! You're already raising a chocobo!${prompt};And I must say, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is beginning to develop a pretty distinguished air.${prompt}
I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables!${prompt};${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s growth seems to have stabilized. The animal looks really distinguished now!${prompt}

We'll take good care of it, then... This is going to be the greatest chocobo ever!${prompt};But, ${name-player}... You still haven't named it.${prompt}

Afraid it's stopped caring about you now?${prompt};${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is spoiled rotten! You should discipline it more often!${prompt}

Before you know it, your verrry own chocobo will come galloping gallantly to your side.${prompt};I'll warn you right now, but some of the loot is pretty deep, so you may have to dig multiple times beforrre you uncover any chests.${prompt}
Once it arrives, your map will open and you'll have the opportunity to confirm the general location of the burrried treasure in that area.${prompt};But, with a little bit of luck and a lot of bits of persistence, you'll be rolling in goodies in no time!${prompt}
Please note that once your chocobo has gobbled up the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, you'll need to obtain another from a VCS representative before playing again.${prompt};That's rrright! Once you've unearthed the chest, all that's left is to open it. Whatever you find inside is yours to keep.${prompt}
Ah yes... I knew you'd want to hear about that.;Now, to increase your chances of finding treasure, you'll want to know how chocobo abilities can give you that extrrra edge.${prompt}
Well, first ride your chocobo out to the location indicated on your map.${prompt};The ones that will help you most are “Treasure Finder,” “Burrow,” and “Bore.”${prompt}
When you think you're close to where the treasure might be buried, take a test dig and see what happens.${prompt};Burrow and Bore will allow you to go deeper with each dig, helping you reach the chest beforrre your bird grows too tired.${prompt}
All chocobos have noses for finding burrried goods, and depending on how hot or cold you are (Get it? That's where we got the name for the game!) your steed will react differently.${prompt};Treasure Finder does just that--helps you find the treasure easierrr by honing your chocobo's sense of smell.${prompt}
The closer you are, the more drrramatic that reaction will be, so listen carefully.${prompt};Alright, this part is the most important, so I'm going to need you to listen up.${prompt}
When you think you've found the spot...${prompt};Digging for extended periods of time can rrreally drain a chocobo's strength.${prompt}
...dig and dig, and then dig some more!${prompt};Push your bird too harrrd, and it may just reach that point where it refuses to dig anymore.${prompt}
I'll warn you right now, but some of the loot is pretty deep, so you may have to dig multiple times beforrre you uncover any chests.${prompt};When this happens, you might as well tighten the string on your gobbiebag because you won't be getting any morrre treasure that day.${prompt}
But, with a little bit of luck and a lot of bits of persistence, you'll be rolling in goodies in no time!${prompt};In other words, locating the chest in the fewest possible digs will be the key to your success.${prompt}
That's rrright! Once you've unearthed the chest, all that's left is to open it. Whatever you find inside is yours to keep.${prompt};Remember that.${prompt}
Now, to increase your chances of finding treasure, you'll want to know how chocobo abilities can give you that extrrra edge.${prompt};Okay! Now I think you're finally rrready to head out there and start digging!${prompt}
The ones that will help you most are “Treasure Finder,” “Burrow,” and “Bore.”${prompt};Let me get you your two complimentary licenses...${prompt}
Burrow and Bore will allow you to go deeper with each dig, helping you reach the chest beforrre your bird grows too tired.${prompt};Here's a ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} and a ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt}
Treasure Finder does just that--helps you find the treasure easierrr by honing your chocobo's sense of smell.${prompt};And here's your ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Alright, this part is the most important, so I'm going to need you to listen up.${prompt};Like I told you before, too much digging is hard on your chocobo, so the VCS prohibits me from giving adventurers too many of these ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Digging for extended periods of time can rrreally drain a chocobo's strength.${prompt};If you want any more, let your chocobo rest a while beforrre coming back, alright?${prompt}
Push your bird too harrrd, and it may just reach that point where it refuses to dig anymore.${prompt};Okay. I can tell that you've heard enough from me.${prompt}
When this happens, you might as well tighten the string on your gobbiebag because you won't be getting any morrre treasure that day.${prompt};You're frrree to go! Talk to you later!${prompt}
In other words, locating the chest in the fewest possible digs will be the key to your success.${prompt};Step rrright up, boys and girls! I can give you IX finally fantastic reasons why the Chocobo Hot and Cold Game is the most fun you'll have on the back of a giant yellow bird!${prompt}
Remember that.${prompt};So, what do you need?

What would you like to know?;Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt}
${selection-lines};We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt}
Why race chocobos, anyway?;However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt}
How do I register for a race?;The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt}
How do I prepare for a race?;And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt}
What kind of races are there?;Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt}
What are “racing teams”?;First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
Quit.;Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}
Return.${prompt};As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
Why not!?;Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt};Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt}
We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt};Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt}
However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt};In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt}
The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt};Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt}
And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt};Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}
Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt};Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt};Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt};There are two main types of races.${prompt}
As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt};The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}
Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt};Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt};You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt};However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt};The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt}
Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt};You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)${prompt}
Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt};The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt};Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt};Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
There are two main types of races.${prompt};In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt};You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt};Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt};Ah, it says here that you are a member of the ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.${prompt}
However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt};Have you come today to change your affiliation?${prompt}
The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt};Remember, you will not be able to use any chocobucks earned in ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] here, and you will also lose any Solo Victory Points that you may have. Are you sure you want to go through with this?${prompt}

Victory points.;Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt}
Race Progression.;The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt}
That's about it.${prompt};The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt}
A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.${prompt};The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt}
Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.${prompt};In such an event, the “less endowed” of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.${prompt}
In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.${prompt};Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.${prompt}

The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.${prompt};For example, a “C4 Chocobo Race” would indicate a typical grade 4 race.${prompt}
What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.${prompt};We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.${prompt}
Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt};No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.${prompt}
Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.${prompt};Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.${prompt}
The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.${prompt};As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.${prompt}
The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.${prompt};Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.${prompt}
The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.${prompt};Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.${prompt}

${selection-lines};For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt}
What is chocobetting?;And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt}

Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt};It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt}
For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt};What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt}

Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt};The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins.

With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.${prompt};Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt}
As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!${prompt};The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.
“The Monster Races”!${prompt};It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt}
Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing! ${prompt};Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.
Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele.;If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt}
What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?${prompt};Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.
First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown.

Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt};Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}
As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt};Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt};Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt};There are two main types of races.${prompt}

If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt};However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.;The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}.

With me today is a man who needs absolutely no introduction, Markovich, and our favorite...${prompt};But of course! I had forgotten all about it!
Oh...?;Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!
Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?${prompt};Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt}
I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt};But that's not where it ends!
Is that so...?;There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt}
Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt};A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.
Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone.;Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt}
You of all people should know that the show must go on!${prompt};It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt}
Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own “baby” will be taking the field!${prompt};Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!
Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!${prompt};But...${prompt}
But of course! I had forgotten all about it!;But...?${prompt}
Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!;I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt}
Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt};I see...
But that's not where it ends!;Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt}
There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt};You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.
A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.;Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt}
Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt};But enough talking, I say.
It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt};It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt}
Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!;Oh, yes, right...
But...${prompt};Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!
But...?${prompt};It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt}
I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt};In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt}
I see...;Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?
Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt};I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt}
You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.;${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don't let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep's clothing”!${prompt}
Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt};I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt}
But enough talking, I say.;I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt}
It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt};Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt}
Oh, yes, right...;Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt}
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!;With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt}
It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt};Whoopee!
In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt};Bring them on, I say!${prompt}
Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?;Erm...yes...
I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt};Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt}
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don't let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep's clothing”!${prompt};Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt}
I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt};Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!
I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt};Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt}
Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt};Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.
Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt};I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt}
With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt};And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt}
Whoopee!;My, oh my...!
Bring them on, I say!${prompt};I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt}
Erm...yes...;A-ahem!
Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt};I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt}
Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt};All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!
Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!;Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt}
Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt};It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...
Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.;<Sniffle>${prompt}
I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt};Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt};...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt}
My, oh my...!;Hrmmm...
I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt};Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt}
A-ahem!;Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt}
I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt};What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!
All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!;There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt}
Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt};Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt}
It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...;And won't you look at the lineup!
<Sniffle>${prompt};This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?
Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2};I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt}
...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt};And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt}
Hrmmm...;Huh?
Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt};Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt}
Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt};Ohohohohohoho!
What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!;You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt}
There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt};<Gulp>
Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt};You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt}
And won't you look at the lineup!;...Professor Shantotto!${prompt}
This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?;If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,
I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt};as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt}
And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt};Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,
Huh?;four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt}
Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt};So if you care to hear out my little proposal,
Ohohohohohoho!;these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt}
You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt};With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...
<Gulp>;Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt}
You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt};With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?
...Professor Shantotto!${prompt};Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt}
If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,;First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt}
as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt};Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.
Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,;I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt}
four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt};Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt}
So if you care to hear out my little proposal,;Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”
these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt};Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt}
With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...;Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt}
Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt};Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.
With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?;If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt}
Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt};Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt}
First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt};For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.
Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.;Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt}
I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt};Um...Professor Shantotto...
Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt};Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt}
Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”;Ohohohohoho!
Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt};Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.
Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt};But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt}
Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.;Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.
If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt};Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt}
Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt};Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.
For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.;So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt}
Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt};Ohohohohohoho!
Um...Professor Shantotto...;Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--
Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt};that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt}
Ohohohohoho!;The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.
Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.;But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt}
But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt};H-hey!
Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.;What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt}
Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt};My, my, what a pleasant surprise!
Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.;I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt}
So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt};How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!
Ohohohohohoho!;This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt}
Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--;Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.
that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt};I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt}
The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.;And you, Goccilo!
But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt};What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt}
H-hey!;Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!
What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt};Until next time...!${prompt}
My, my, what a pleasant surprise!;${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt}
I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt};What's with the baffled expression?
How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!;It's me, Sakura.${prompt}
This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt};You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.
Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.;I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt}
I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt};I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt}
And you, Goccilo!;I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt}
What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt};And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt}
Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!;I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt}
Until next time...!${prompt};Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt}
${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt};I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt}
What's with the baffled expression?;I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt}
It's me, Sakura.${prompt};And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.;But something seems to be different...
I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt};Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt}
I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt};She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt}
I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt};The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt}
And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt};I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!
I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt};A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt}
Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt};And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt}
I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt};It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt}
I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt};And that completes the lineup, folks.
And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2};With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt}
But something seems to be different...;You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt};Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt};I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt}
The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt};I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt}
I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!;I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt}
A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt};But no more...
And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt};If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt}
It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt};This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt}
And that completes the lineup, folks.;I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt};Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt}
You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt}
Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt};I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt}
I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt};Next, we have Sakura...${prompt}
I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt};Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?
I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt};This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt}
But no more...;Well I'll be...
If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt};In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt}
This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt};...${prompt}
I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt};Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.
Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt};For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt}
Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt};${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt}
I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt};Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!
Next, we have Sakura...${prompt};Congratulations!${prompt}
Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?;Great race, ${name-player}.
This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt};It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt}
Well I'll be...;But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..
In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt};With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt}
...${prompt};Princess...
Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.;Princess Sakura!${prompt}
For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt};Princess...?
${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt};What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt}
Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!;Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.
Congratulations!${prompt};I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt}
Great race, ${name-player}.;Searching for...me?${prompt}
It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt};Yes, Your Highness.
But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..;You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt}
With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt};Are you serious!?
Princess...;Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt}
Princess Sakura!${prompt};That is correct.
Princess...?;Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt}
What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt};D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt}
Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.;...!
I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt};I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt}
Searching for...me?${prompt};Wh...what happened?${prompt}
Yes, Your Highness.;You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.
You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt};You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt}
Are you serious!?;She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt}
Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt};Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.
That is correct.;But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt}
Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt};My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt}
D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt};So that's what happened...${prompt}
...!;Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt}
I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt};...${prompt}
Wh...what happened?${prompt};I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt}
You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.;Your Highness!
You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt};But...why!?${prompt}
She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt};Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt}
Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.;What's more...${prompt}
But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt};I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt}
My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt};I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt}
So that's what happened...${prompt};What...?${prompt}
Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt};The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt}
...${prompt};And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?
I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt};I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt}
Your Highness!;I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt}
But...why!?${prompt};Heehee!
Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt};Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt}
What's more...${prompt};${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!
I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt};Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt}
I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt};You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt}
What...?${prompt};Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt}
The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt};What?
And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?;How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt}
I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt};Hohoho...
I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt};It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.${prompt}
Heehee!;I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...${prompt}
Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt};Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos?
${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!;No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.${prompt}
Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt};Sakura is the queen, you say?${prompt}
You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt};<Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises.
Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt};But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.${prompt}
What?;You know what they say: Home is where the heart is.
How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt};To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.${prompt}
Hohoho...;And you, our new Chocochampion!
It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life.

So, are you interested in some entry-level duties to put you well on your way to greatness?;Very well, then! As a reward for successful completion of your first assignment I would like to present you with these ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Not to worry, I've got just the thing for you!${prompt};There is more here than “meats” the eye! That was a joke...
Go talk to the guard Aravoge just over yonder and have him cast “Signet” on you. Then come back and see me.${prompt};Anyway, this is a type of item known amongst adventurers as a “meal.”
Go talk to the guard Rabid Wolf over yonder and have him cast “Signet” on you. Then come back and see me.${prompt};This meal in particular will temporarily enhance your attack power when eaten.${prompt}
Go talk to the guard Harara over yonder and have her cast “Signet” on you. Then come back and see me.${prompt};Whenever any type of meal is consumed, you will receive some such temporary status bonus.
Well, it looks like you were able to get your Signet. Easy enough, yes?${prompt};Naturally, different meals grant different types of bonuses.${prompt}
As long as Signet is in effect, there is always a possibility that you will obtain crystals from any enemies that you defeat.;For the most part, meat dishes will affect attack power.
There are also other more concrete benefits, such as increased defense and evasion.${prompt};Conversely, seafood dishes generally enhance defense, and so on and so forth.
Signet even helps you when not engaged in combat with an enemy. For example, it boosts the rate at which healing occurs while at rest.;Take care to select dishes best suited to your purpose.${prompt}
For all of these reasons and more, you should consider it essential to have Signet cast on you at all times.${prompt};One thing you should make note of, however, is that you cannot eat a meal while another meal's status bonus is still in effect.
Very well, then! As a reward for successful completion of your first assignment I would like to present you with these ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt};Your stomach would simply burst!${prompt}
There is more here than “meats” the eye! That was a joke...;Hmmm, that's quite a lot to cover...
Anyway, this is a type of item known amongst adventurers as a “meal.”;Are you with me so far?${prompt}
This meal in particular will temporarily enhance your attack power when eaten.${prompt};So far so good?
Whenever any type of meal is consumed, you will receive some such temporary status bonus.;${selection-lines}
Naturally, different meals grant different types of bonuses.${prompt};Explain Signet again.
For the most part, meat dishes will affect attack power.;Explain meals again.
Conversely, seafood dishes generally enhance defense, and so on and so forth.;This is a breeze.${prompt}
Take care to select dishes best suited to your purpose.${prompt};Great! Well, talking can only prepare you so much. Let's get right down to it.
One thing you should make note of, however, is that you cannot eat a meal while another meal's status bonus is still in effect.;Go ahead and pop one of those ${item-plural: 0[2]}!${prompt}
Your stomach would simply burst!${prompt};After eating a meal, a status icon designated as “Food” will appear in the upper-left portion of your screen.
Hmmm, that's quite a lot to cover...;Come back and talk to me again once you've confirmed that it's there.${prompt}
Are you with me so far?${prompt};Check out the full belly on you! Well done!
So far so good?;Signet and meals can both play crucial roles whenever you take on any type of enemy.
${selection-lines};This is a key lesson that you would do well not to forget!${prompt}
Explain Signet again.;Next, let's get those pristine hands of yours nice and dirty!
Explain meals again.;No sense in letting that food go to waste now, is there? Let's send you out to fight a monster on a full stomach!${prompt}
This is a breeze.${prompt};Exiting through that gate over there will lead you into an area with hostile enemies.${prompt}
Great! Well, talking can only prepare you so much. Let's get right down to it.;Try to target one of the monsters and then select the “Check” option from your menu.
Go ahead and pop one of those ${item-plural: 0[2]}!${prompt};This will help you ascertain an enemy's level of difficulty and make sure they are not too strong. A smart adventurer picks ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] fights.${prompt}
After eating a meal, a status icon designated as “Food” will appear in the upper-left portion of your screen.;Be warned. Engaging any enemy that checks as “very tough” or above will result in your Signet not granting you the defense and evasion bonuses you would otherwise receive.${prompt}
Come back and talk to me again once you've confirmed that it's there.${prompt};And that brings us to your next assignment!${prompt}
Check out the full belly on you! Well done!;It's high time you learned how to use a “weapon skill”!${prompt}
Signet and meals can both play crucial roles whenever you take on any type of enemy.;Perhaps you've already noticed, but sometimes while fighting an enemy, your “skills” will rise little by little.${prompt}
This is a key lesson that you would do well not to forget!${prompt};When your skill with the weapon you are wielding reaches a predetermined value, weapon skills will become available for use.${prompt}
Next, let's get those pristine hands of yours nice and dirty!;“Combo” for those adept with hand-to-hand weapons. “Wasp Sting” for those who fight with daggers.
No sense in letting that food go to waste now, is there? Let's send you out to fight a monster on a full stomach!${prompt};“Fast Blade” for those who prefer the sword.${prompt}
Exiting through that gate over there will lead you into an area with hostile enemies.${prompt};“Shining Strike” for wielders of the club. “Heavy Swing” for those who take up the staff.
Try to target one of the monsters and then select the “Check” option from your menu.;And on, and on, and on...${prompt}
This will help you ascertain an enemy's level of difficulty and make sure they are not too strong. A smart adventurer picks ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] fights.${prompt};Selecting “Status” from the main menu will bring up the “Combat Skl.” option.
Be warned. Engaging any enemy that checks as “very tough” or above will result in your Signet not granting you the defense and evasion bonuses you would otherwise receive.${prompt};This will display all of the current skill values in all weapon categories.${prompt}
And that brings us to your next assignment!${prompt};The first weapon skill for each weapon type can be learned at a skill value of 5.
It's high time you learned how to use a “weapon skill”!${prompt};So make that your first goal, and we'll take it from there!${prompt}
Perhaps you've already noticed, but sometimes while fighting an enemy, your “skills” will rise little by little.${prompt};Ohhh! Somebody went and learned a new weapon skill, didn't ${choice-player-gender}[he/she]?
When your skill with the weapon you are wielding reaches a predetermined value, weapon skills will become available for use.${prompt};Very good!${prompt}
“Combo” for those adept with hand-to-hand weapons. “Wasp Sting” for those who fight with daggers.;I can see by that twinkle in your eyes that you've already used it on some poor, unfortunate creature, but I'll explain just a bit more.
“Fast Blade” for those who prefer the sword.${prompt};Whenever your “Tactical Points” (TP) reach 1000 or more, selecting “Abilities” and then “Weapon Skl.” from the menu will display a list of usable weapon skills.${prompt}
“Shining Strike” for wielders of the club. “Heavy Swing” for those who take up the staff.;These are deadly techniques capable of rendering massive damage on enemies.
And on, and on, and on...${prompt};It is well worth an adventurer's time to learn and master them.${prompt}
Selecting “Status” from the main menu will bring up the “Combat Skl.” option.;Ah, by the way, were you fortunate enough to receive some items from the monsters you fought?${prompt}
This will display all of the current skill values in all weapon categories.${prompt};If you were lucky enough to come across any ${item-plural: 0[2]}, make sure you hang onto them.
The first weapon skill for each weapon type can be learned at a skill value of 5;They may pay dividends later on...${prompt}
So make that your first goal, and we'll take it from there!${prompt};Also, that reminds me. There is another lesson better learned sooner than later.
Ohhh! Somebody went and learned a new weapon skill, didn't ${choice-player-gender}[he/she]?;They are truly versatile items that can be used for a number of purposes.
Very good!${prompt};These include trading them to guards for certain rewards, and selling them to earn money, just to name a few.${prompt}
I can see by that twinkle in your eyes that you've already used it on some poor, unfortunate creature, but I'll explain just a bit more.;For now, I'd like to explain more about another of their uses. Namely, the role they play in “synthesis.”${prompt}
Whenever your “Tactical Points” (TP) reach 1000 or more, selecting “Abilities” and then “Weapon Skl.” from the menu will display a list of usable weapon skills.${prompt};But first things first. Your reward for completing your last assignment! Here you are, then.
These are deadly techniques capable of rendering massive damage on enemies.;Now, using ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} will bring up the synthesis interface.
It is well worth an adventurer's time to learn and master them.${prompt};All that remains is to select the “OK” option, and the synthesis will commence!${prompt}
Ah, by the way, were you fortunate enough to receive some items from the monsters you fought?${prompt};You'll find that the crafting process will never begin, should the ingredients you've selected not form a viable synthesis recipe.
If you were lucky enough to come across any ${item-plural: 0[2]}, make sure you hang onto them.;Also, even when your materials are correct, there is always a chance that your synthesis will fail, so please be wary.${prompt}
They may pay dividends later on...${prompt};The majority of items which you create via synthesis, as well as most of those dropped by enemies you defeat, can be placed on the “Auction House” for sale.${prompt}
Also, that reminds me. There is another lesson better learned sooner than later.;The auction house is an ultra-consumer venue where you can attempt to purchase the wares of other players by placing bids, as well as have other players bid on items you have put up for sale.${prompt}
They are truly versatile items that can be used for a number of purposes.;My words alone can do no justice to the vast cornucopia of goods that is the auction house.
These include trading them to guards for certain rewards, and selling them to earn money, just to name a few.${prompt};One simply must see it with one's own eyes.${prompt}
For now, I'd like to explain more about another of their uses. Namely, the role they play in “synthesis.”${prompt};Are you still with me?
But first things first. Your reward for completing your last assignment! Here you are, then.;${selection-lines}
Now, using ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} will bring up the synthesis interface.;Explain synthesis again.
All that remains is to select the “OK” option, and the synthesis will commence!${prompt};Explain the auction house again.
You'll find that the crafting process will never begin, should the ingredients you've selected not form a viable synthesis recipe.;Sure am.${prompt}
Also, even when your materials are correct, there is always a chance that your synthesis will fail, so please be wary.${prompt};Somewhere in this great city lies our nation's auction house. Seek it out, and report back to me when you have found it.${prompt}
The majority of items which you create via synthesis, as well as most of those dropped by enemies you defeat, can be placed on the “Auction House” for sale.${prompt};You needn't worry about going through with an actual purchase.
The auction house is an ultra-consumer venue where you can attempt to purchase the wares of other players by placing bids, as well as have other players bid on items you have put up for sale.${prompt};Simply examining any of the “Auction Counters” will more than suffice.${prompt}
My words alone can do no justice to the vast cornucopia of goods that is the auction house.;So, you were able to locate the auction house!
One simply must see it with one's own eyes.${prompt};Pretty hard to miss, isn't it?${prompt}
Are you still with me?;What do you think? It is as I said, yes? Few organizations in this world exceed the auction house in scale.
${selection-lines};It will never cease to be of use to you throughout your adventures. It would be wise to become adept at using it.${prompt}
Explain synthesis again.;And now down to brass tacks!
Explain the auction house again.;Let's see if we can't get you to up some levels!${prompt}
Sure am.${prompt};There are several items in existence which serve to enhance the number of experience points you receive for defeating enemies.${prompt}
Somewhere in this great city lies our nation's auction house. Seek it out, and report back to me when you have found it.${prompt};For example, there are ${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 1[2]}, and ${item-plural: 2[2]}, just to name a few.${prompt}
You needn't worry about going through with an actual purchase.;These are a bit unique in that you must wait a certain amount of time after equipping them before you may use them.${prompt}
Simply examining any of the “Auction Counters” will more than suffice.${prompt};There is also a predetermined amount of time, usually quite long, that must pass before these items can be used again.
So, you were able to locate the auction house!;The total number of times you may use any single item is also limited, so be mindful of that as well.${prompt}
Pretty hard to miss, isn't it?${prompt};Many of these items may be obtained from the same guards that provide you with Signet.
What do you think? It is as I said, yes? Few organizations in this world exceed the auction house in scale.;You need only exchange “Conquest Points” in order to acquire them.${prompt}
It will never cease to be of use to you throughout your adventures. It would be wise to become adept at using it.${prompt};As a matter of fact, for finishing that last assignment, I'm going to give you this ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.
And now down to brass tacks!;With this, you'll be able to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} without having to use any of your Conquest Points.${prompt}
Let's see if we can't get you to up some levels!${prompt};Head over to any guard and have a go at exchanging them for something.
There are several items in existence which serve to enhance the number of experience points you receive for defeating enemies.${prompt};And after that, see if you can't make it all the way up to level four.
For example, there are ${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 1[2]}, and ${item-plural: 2[2]}, just to name a few.${prompt};I'll be right here waiting for you when you get back.${prompt}
These are a bit unique in that you must wait a certain amount of time after equipping them before you may use them.${prompt};With an experience bonus in place, it should take you practically no time at all.
There is also a predetermined amount of time, usually quite long, that must pass before these items can be used again.;Good luck, and be careful! It can get quite hairy out there!${prompt}
The total number of times you may use any single item is also limited, so be mindful of that as well.${prompt};Well, well, well! We might make an adventurer out of you just yet!
Many of these items may be obtained from the same guards that provide you with Signet.;Looks like we've almost washed all that green off of you.${prompt}
You need only exchange “Conquest Points” in order to acquire them.${prompt};A bit of bad news now, though.
As a matter of fact, for finishing that last assignment, I'm going to give you this ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.;Starting from level 31, anytime you are knocked unconscious your experience points will suffer a deduction.${prompt}
With this, you'll be able to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} without having to use any of your Conquest Points.${prompt};As a general rule, the amount penalized will be about 10% of the total amount required to reach the next level.
Head over to any guard and have a go at exchanging them for something.;You have to be more careful than ever from here on out!${prompt}
And after that, see if you can't make it all the way up to level four.;However, there are ways to minimize this loss of experience points.${prompt}
I'll be right here waiting for you when you get back.${prompt};Like this, for example. Go on, take it. Your reward for reaching level four.
With an experience bonus in place, it should take you practically no time at all.;It's called ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Good luck, and be careful! It can get quite hairy out there!${prompt};Using this will grant you a status known as “Reraise.”
Well, well, well! We might make an adventurer out of you just yet!;Whenever you are rendered unconscious while this effect is in place, you will have the option to revive yourself.${prompt}
Looks like we've almost washed all that green off of you.${prompt};Choosing to do so will cause you to be resuscitated in the very spot where you have fallen.
A bit of bad news now, though.;In addition, as I stated previously, the amount of experience points you lose will be somewhat lessened.${prompt}
Starting from level 31, anytime you are knocked unconscious your experience points will suffer a deduction.${prompt};That is, once equipped, you must wait a certain period of time before they can be used, and there are both cooldown timers and limited charges as well.${prompt}
As a general rule, the amount penalized will be about 10% of the total amount required to reach the next level.;All of these items as a whole are collectively referred to as “enchanted items.”
You have to be more careful than ever from here on out!${prompt};There is a vast array of other enchanted items with myriad other effects that will prove useful on your adventures.
However, there are ways to minimize this loss of experience points.${prompt};It may be worth the time and effort to better acquaint yourself with them at some point.${prompt}
Like this, for example. Go on, take it. Your reward for reaching level four.;It seems you're starting to get the hang of things.
It's called ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};Next, I'd like for you to go and fight some enemies in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon].${prompt}
Using this will grant you a status known as “Reraise.”;${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/The Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] is located beyond the ${choice: 2}[southern/northern/northern] reaches of ${choice: 2}[West Ronfaure/North Gustaberg/East Sarutabaruta].${prompt}
Whenever you are rendered unconscious while this effect is in place, you will have the option to revive yourself.${prompt};You're sure to encounter some new monsters there that you won't find prowling around the outskirts of the city.
Choosing to do so will cause you to be resuscitated in the very spot where you have fallen.;It may be a bit daunting, so I'll only require that you slay one such beast, and then head on back.${prompt}
In addition, as I stated previously, the amount of experience points you lose will be somewhat lessened.${prompt};Just keep in mind, the farther you stray from the city, the more ferocious monsters tend to be.
That is, once equipped, you must wait a certain period of time before they can be used, and there are both cooldown timers and limited charges as well.${prompt};Don't say I didn't warn you.${prompt}
All of these items as a whole are collectively referred to as “enchanted items.”;Make sure to use the “Check” command to determine the strength of your enemy.
There is a vast array of other enchanted items with myriad other effects that will prove useful on your adventures.;If you find that you are surrounded by enemies too difficult for you, try heading back to a previous area closer to the city and leveling up a bit more first.${prompt}
It may be worth the time and effort to better acquaint yourself with them at some point.${prompt};I know those smells...
It seems you're starting to get the hang of things.;You smell of victory! And of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon]! Good on you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
Next, I'd like for you to go and fight some enemies in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon].${prompt};But by now you must be getting sick and tired of fighting the same old monsters so close to the city walls, aren't you?${prompt}
${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/The Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] is located beyond the ${choice: 2}[southern/northern/northern] reaches of ${choice: 2}[West Ronfaure/North Gustaberg/East Sarutabaruta].${prompt};If you are several levels beyond a monster and totally outclass them in every respect, checking them will yield a “too weak to be worthwhile” result.${prompt}
You're sure to encounter some new monsters there that you won't find prowling around the outskirts of the city.;Killing monsters so far beneath you is borderline cowardice, and will net you no experience points.${prompt}
It may be a bit daunting, so I'll only require that you slay one such beast, and then head on back.${prompt};If you start to notice more and more of these “too weak” monsters around you, consider moving farther from the city to a more difficult area.${prompt}
Just keep in mind, the farther you stray from the city, the more ferocious monsters tend to be.;Congratulations on another milestone! Reward tiiime!
Don't say I didn't warn you.${prompt};You've just earned yourself ${number: 0} experience points, hotshot.${prompt}
Make sure to use the “Check” command to determine the strength of your enemy.;Let's dive right into your next assignment while that blood is still pumping!${prompt}
If you find that you are surrounded by enemies too difficult for you, try heading back to a previous area closer to the city and leveling up a bit more first.${prompt};I'm going to up the stakes here a little bit, ${name-player}. But it's for your own good.
I know those smells...;I want you to go out and get all the way to level ten.${prompt}
You smell of victory! And of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon]! Good on you, ${name-player}.${prompt};Considering your current level and the knowledge you have, you shouldn't confine yourself to the immediate vicinity of the city.
But by now you must be getting sick and tired of fighting the same old monsters so close to the city walls, aren't you?${prompt};You're more than capable of besting monsters in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] at this point.${prompt}
If you are several levels beyond a monster and totally outclass them in every respect, checking them will yield a “too weak to be worthwhile” result.${prompt};I knew you wouldn't disappoint me. So how's it feel? You're moving on up in the world.
Killing monsters so far beneath you is borderline cowardice, and will net you no experience points.${prompt};Time to put some money in those pockets. A ${number: 1}-gil reward, just for you. Don't spend it all in one place.${prompt}
If you start to notice more and more of these “too weak” monsters around you, consider moving farther from the city to a more difficult area.${prompt};By now you should be relatively familiar with the basics of battle. Am I right or am I right?${prompt}
Congratulations on another milestone! Reward tiiime!;But don't go getting too cocky!
You've just earned yourself ${number: 0} experience points, hotshot.${prompt};This world is chock-full of monsters just waiting for the opportune moment to pounce and knock you out cold!${prompt}
Let's dive right into your next assignment while that blood is still pumping!${prompt};Depending on the type of monster, there are several factors that could cause them to attack you without provocation.
I'm going to up the stakes here a little bit, ${name-player}. But it's for your own good.;I'll enumerate some of the more common types of this blatantly aggressive behavior for you.${prompt}
I want you to go out and get all the way to level ten.${prompt};For starters, and most obviously, there are monsters which detect by sight. They will attack you whenever you enter their field of vision. This is the most prevalent type. They simply cannot stand the sight of adventurers.${prompt}
Considering your current level and the knowledge you have, you shouldn't confine yourself to the immediate vicinity of the city.;Next, there are those monsters which detect by sound. They can be a bit more dangerous than visually-dependent monsters, in that they will attack the source of any sound within a certain prescribed radius.
You're more than capable of besting monsters in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] at this point.${prompt};You may not think it, but there are a great many monsters whose aural senses are far more developed than their sense of sight.${prompt}
I knew you wouldn't disappoint me. So how's it feel? You're moving on up in the world.;There are also monsters which detect their enemies' spellcasting. Much like the sound-detecting types, these monsters will attack the source of any magic casting within a certain radius of their being.
Time to put some money in those pockets. A ${number: 1}-gil reward, just for you. Don't spend it all in one place.${prompt};Not surprisingly, many monsters in the arcana family rely heavily on this method of detection, which covers a comparatively larger range than the aforementioned sense of hearing.${prompt}
By now you should be relatively familiar with the basics of battle. Am I right or am I right?${prompt};And finally, there are opportunistic monsters which prey upon the weak and near-dead, pinpointing their prey by detecting low hit points.
But don't go getting too cocky!;The family of undead creatures abound in monsters of this type. Even more distressing, the fewer the hit points you have, the farther the distance from which you can be detected.${prompt}
This world is chock-full of monsters just waiting for the opportune moment to pounce and knock you out cold!${prompt};Your next assignment will attempt to familiarize you with these detection methods, and train you to become adept at avoiding them.${prompt}
Depending on the type of monster, there are several factors that could cause them to attack you without provocation.;I want you to travel once again to ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], and retrieve an item known as a “Gate Crystal.”${prompt}
I'll enumerate some of the more common types of this blatantly aggressive behavior for you.${prompt};Near the center of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], you will find a large, white, almost otherworldly structure. On the area map, it is labeled as the ${choice: 2}[Crag of Holla/Crag of Dem/Crag of Mea].${prompt}
For starters, and most obviously, there are monsters which detect by sight. They will attack you whenever you enter their field of vision. This is the most prevalent type. They simply cannot stand the sight of adventurers.${prompt};There you will find one of an enormous series of crystals known as “Telepoints.”
Next, there are those monsters which detect by sound. They can be a bit more dangerous than visually-dependent monsters, in that they will attack the source of any sound within a certain prescribed radius.;Simply examine the telepoint you find there, and bring back your findings.${prompt}
You may not think it, but there are a great many monsters whose aural senses are far more developed than their sense of sight.${prompt};Only when you present your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to me shall your assignment be complete.${prompt}
There are also monsters which detect their enemies' spellcasting. Much like the sound-detecting types, these monsters will attack the source of any magic casting within a certain radius of their being.;Exercise the utmost caution. There are many extremely dangerous monsters in the area you will be visiting.
Not surprisingly, many monsters in the arcana family rely heavily on this method of detection, which covers a comparatively larger range than the aforementioned sense of hearing.${prompt};And take extra care not to draw the attention of any beastmen.${prompt}
And finally, there are opportunistic monsters which prey upon the weak and near-dead, pinpointing their prey by detecting low hit points.;This shall be your final assignment.
The family of undead creatures abound in monsters of this type. Even more distressing, the fewer the hit points you have, the farther the distance from which you can be detected.${prompt};Go now, and may the Goddess watch over you.${prompt}
Your next assignment will attempt to familiarize you with these detection methods, and train you to become adept at avoiding them.${prompt};Ahhh, the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, just as I requested.
I want you to travel once again to ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], and retrieve an item known as a “Gate Crystal.”${prompt};Excellent work, ${name-player}.${prompt}
Near the center of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], you will find a large, white, almost otherworldly structure. On the area map, it is labeled as the ${choice: 2}[Crag of Holla/Crag of Dem/Crag of Mea].${prompt};And now for some information regarding this little beauty.
There you will find one of an enormous series of crystals known as “Telepoints.”;As long as you have this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, you will be able to be transported by the appropriate spell of teleportation directly to the telepoint from which you retrieved it.${prompt}
Simply examine the telepoint you find there, and bring back your findings.${prompt};I doubt that you will have many opportunities to use it for the time being, but you would do well to remember what I have said.${prompt}
Only when you present your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to me shall your assignment be complete.${prompt};Several such telepoints exist, scattered throughout Vana'diel.
Exercise the utmost caution. There are many extremely dangerous monsters in the area you will be visiting.;Each has its own specific gate crystal, which you will receive the first time that you examine any of them.${prompt}
And take extra care not to draw the attention of any beastmen.${prompt};Let me take this time to offer you a most heartfelt congratulations, ${name-player}!
This shall be your final assignment.;You have successfully completed all of the assignments I have laid before you.${prompt}
Go now, and may the Goddess watch over you.${prompt};And here I have a most fitting reward for you. A gift of ${number: 1} experience points, and ${number: 3} ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt}
Ahhh, the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, just as I requested.;I fear that I have nothing more to teach you.
Excellent work, ${name-player}.${prompt};From now on, your lessons will best be learned by giving a mindful ear to others and being ever observant on your travels.${prompt}
And now for some information regarding this little beauty.;Do remember, though, that the paths open before you will multiply greatly should you cooperate with other adventurers.${prompt}
As long as you have this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, you will be able to be transported by the appropriate spell of teleportation directly to the telepoint from which you retrieved it.${prompt};Leveling, for example, is an endeavor made immeasurably more efficient and enjoyable in the company of others.
I doubt that you will have many opportunities to use it for the time being, but you would do well to remember what I have said.${prompt};It helps to not only guarantee you some modicum of safety in numbers, but also rewards you with considerably more experience points than adventuring alone.${prompt}
Several such telepoints exist, scattered throughout Vana'diel.;I suppose it does require a good deal of courage to approach an adventurer you do not know, but I strongly encourage you to do so.
Each has its own specific gate crystal, which you will receive the first time that you examine any of them.${prompt};It may prove to be the beginning of an extremely rewarding and long-lasting friendship.${prompt}
Let me take this time to offer you a most heartfelt congratulations, ${name-player}!;There may still be some small facets of adventuring that I can continue to offer you advice on.
You have successfully completed all of the assignments I have laid before you.${prompt};Should you ever have any questions or anxieties, please do not hesitate to come and see me again.
And here I have a most fitting reward for you. A gift of ${number: 1} experience points, and ${number: 3} ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt};I will do my best to be of service and set your heart at ease.${prompt}
I fear that I have nothing more to teach you.;Go now, and go well. The world awaits its next great adventurer, ${name-player}.${prompt}
From now on, your lessons will best be learned by giving a mindful ear to others and being ever observant on your travels.${prompt};Good day to you! Guardian of the Kingdom, Alaune, at your most humble service.
Do remember, though, that the paths open before you will multiply greatly should you cooperate with other adventurers.${prompt};Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
Leveling, for example, is an endeavor made immeasurably more efficient and enjoyable in the company of others.;Good day to you! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service.
It helps to not only guarantee you some modicum of safety in numbers, but also rewards you with considerably more experience points than adventuring alone.${prompt};Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
I suppose it does require a good deal of courage to approach an adventurer you do not know, but I strongly encourage you to do so.;Good day to you! Protector of the Federation, Selele, at your most humble service..
It may prove to be the beginning of an extremely rewarding and long-lasting friendship.${prompt};Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
There may still be some small facets of adventuring that I can continue to offer you advice on.;What will you ask about?
Should you ever have any questions or anxieties, please do not hesitate to come and see me again.;${selection-lines}

Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt};Just as their name implies, search comments are original messages composed by adventurers which are readily visible to others when using the search function.${prompt}
Good day to you! Protector of the Federation, Selele, at your most humble service..;There are several different categories of search comments.
Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt};These include, but are not limited to, “EXP Party,” “Items,” and “Missions and Quests.”${prompt}
What will you ask about?;Opening the “Search” function from the Main Menu and then selecting the “Comment” option will allow you to conduct a player search by comment type.${prompt}
${selection-lines};For example, if you would like to search for other players to form a leveling party, you need only select “EXP Party” from the list displayed.${prompt}
Nothing just now.;Conversely, if you would like to advertise yourself as interested in being on the receiving end of an experience party invite, you can choose the “Edit Comment” command from the Search menu.${prompt}
Search comments.;Of course, search comment composition differs from person to person.
Skillchains.;You might want to conduct a search first to see what type of search comments are considered the norm before writing your own.${prompt}
Magic bursts.;Skillchains are devastating elemental phenomena which manifest themselves when weapon skills are carried out in a precise and well-timed order. ${prompt}
Skillchains and elements.${prompt};The very natures of the skillchains themselves differ widely, being dependent upon the weapon skills used and the order of their execution.${prompt}
Just as their name implies, search comments are original messages composed by adventurers which are readily visible to others when using the search function.${prompt};To take a simple and timeless example, using the weapon skill “Red Lotus Blade” immediately after “Fast Blade” will yield a type of skillchain known as “Liquefaction.”${prompt}
There are several different categories of search comments.;Furthermore, adding a “Combo” after the liquefaction effect will produce a more advanced “Fusion” skillchain.${prompt}
These include, but are not limited to, “EXP Party,” “Items,” and “Missions and Quests.”${prompt};In the taxonomy of skillchains, each type is related to one or more specific elements.
Opening the “Search” function from the Main Menu and then selecting the “Comment” option will allow you to conduct a player search by comment type.${prompt};Liquefaction is bound to the element of fire, for example, and fusion to both fire and light.${prompt}
For example, if you would like to search for other players to form a leveling party, you need only select “EXP Party” from the list displayed.${prompt};Another crucial point, which I simply cannot emphasize enough, is the importance of timing in the execution of skillchains.${prompt}
Conversely, if you would like to advertise yourself as interested in being on the receiving end of an experience party invite, you can choose the “Edit Comment” command from the Search menu.${prompt};One must not be too overzealous, but too much patience can also be damning.
Of course, search comment composition differs from person to person.;It is most ideal to time the latter weapon skill to begin just a second or two after the preceding one is complete.${prompt}
You might want to conduct a search first to see what type of search comments are considered the norm before writing your own.${prompt};The possible weapon skill sequences and the different skillchains they yield are highly variegated.
Skillchains are devastating elemental phenomena which manifest themselves when weapon skills are carried out in a precise and well-timed order. ${prompt};It is said of this time-tested battle art that it “takes a moment to learn, and a lifetime to master.”${prompt}
The very natures of the skillchains themselves differ widely, being dependent upon the weapon skills used and the order of their execution.${prompt};Magic bursts are another type of supernatural phenomena which occur after carefully selected and impeccably timed spells are cast following a skillchain. Such spells exceed their typical counterparts in that they are enhanced in both power and accuracy.
To take a simple and timeless example, using the weapon skill “Red Lotus Blade” immediately after “Fast Blade” will yield a type of skillchain known as “Liquefaction.”${prompt};You will commonly see magic bursts abbreviated as “MB.”${prompt}
Furthermore, adding a “Combo” after the liquefaction effect will produce a more advanced “Fusion” skillchain.${prompt};Magic bursts will not take place if the element of the spell being cast does not match the element of the skillchain preceding it.${prompt}
In the taxonomy of skillchains, each type is related to one or more specific elements.;To take an example, a detonation skillchain, which has wind as its element, followed by an aero or other like spell, will generate a magic burst.${prompt}
Liquefaction is bound to the element of fire, for example, and fusion to both fire and light.${prompt};In the same vein, thunder, or any cognate spell, would result in a magic burst should it follow an impaction skillchain, itself deriving power from that very element.${prompt}
Another crucial point, which I simply cannot emphasize enough, is the importance of timing in the execution of skillchains.${prompt};As I said previously, some skillchains are associated with more than one element. Take fragmentation, for example. It is composed of equal parts wind and thunder. So chasing a fragmentation skillchain with any type of aero or thunder spell would create a magic burst.${prompt}
One must not be too overzealous, but too much patience can also be damning.;The key to mastering magic bursts lies in learning the elemental attributes of both the skillchains you create as well as the magic you wield. The rest is simply a matter of timing.${prompt}
It is most ideal to time the latter weapon skill to begin just a second or two after the preceding one is complete.${prompt};For your convenience, I will go over the elemental attributes of all skillchain types. Pay close attention.${prompt}
The possible weapon skill sequences and the different skillchains they yield are highly variegated.;Level 1 Skillchain (Associated element):
It is said of this time-tested battle art that it “takes a moment to learn, and a lifetime to master.”${prompt};Transfixion (Light), Liquefaction (Fire), Detonation (Wind),

Such spells exceed their typical counterparts in that they are enhanced in both power and accuracy.;Impaction (Thunder), Induration (Ice), Reverberation (Water),
You will commonly see magic bursts abbreviated as “MB.”${prompt};Scission (Earth), Compression (Darkness).${prompt}
Magic bursts will not take place if the element of the spell being cast does not match the element of the skillchain preceding it.${prompt};Level 2 Skillchain (Associated elements):
To take an example, a detonation skillchain, which has wind as its element, followed by an aero or other like spell, will generate a magic burst.${prompt};Fusion (Light/Fire), Fragmentation (Wind/Thunder),
In the same vein, thunder, or any cognate spell, would result in a magic burst should it follow an impaction skillchain, itself deriving power from that very element.${prompt};Distortion (Ice/Water), Gravitation (Earth/Darkness).${prompt}
As I said previously, some skillchains are associated with more than one element. Take fragmentation, for example. It is composed of equal parts wind and thunder. So chasing a fragmentation skillchain with any type of aero or thunder spell would create a magic burst.${prompt};Level 3 Skillchain (Associated elements):

You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.${prompt};Pretty generous of us for a change, no?${prompt}
Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.${prompt};Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo.
Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip.;So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!${prompt}
I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.${prompt};For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.${prompt}

It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.${prompt};It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.${prompt}
When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.${prompt};Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.${prompt}
I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw.;If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts!
Simple as that, kupo!${prompt};No “I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again!”
What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred!;Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.${prompt}

But I'm not the kind to take on disciples, so at first I was more than a bit wary.${prompt};Please tell me that you weren't in on it!${prompt}
But the old lady, she nagged me, and nagged me, and nagged me until I finally caved in.${prompt};Either way, that's not important now. As long as I'm the master of a ragtag group of youngsters, I'm gonna make sure you all get the training you deserve.${prompt}
How do you respond?;But to do that, I'm gonna need your help.${prompt}
${selection-lines};And I'll warn you--my regimens have been known to be...strict.${prompt}
You can always quit, you know.;And I'm sure I don't need to tell you how strict my regimens are!${prompt}
Must have been tough for you.;What's the password?${prompt}
That's quite the wife you've got.${prompt};How do you respond?

But to do that, I'm gonna need your help.${prompt};...Ah, this is the Unity communication device. Forget I said anything.${prompt}
And I'll warn you--my regimens have been known to be...strict.${prompt};Aldo of the Tenshodo, at your service.${prompt}
And I'm sure I don't need to tell you how strict my regimens are!${prompt};Who's this!?
What's the password?${prompt};...Ah, this is the Unity communication...wait. You're ${name-player}, aren't you?${prompt}

Rose on the heath.;I'm sure the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network would make for...excellent customers in the future.${prompt}

Aldo of the Tenshodo, at your service.${prompt};And it's people like you who I need to understand that most.${prompt}
Who's this!?;Well, do we have a new rrrecruit? I'm Jakoh Wahcondalo, chieftainess of Kazham.${prompt}
...Ah, this is the Unity communication...wait. You're ${name-player}, aren't you?${prompt};Come to think of it...didn't I teach you the secrets of eviscerrration?${prompt}
The way this little thing is buzzing tells me that you're looking to join my Unity.${prompt};Hah-hah-hah! Then all the better for my Unity!${prompt}
“My” Unity being the key here. Who else did you expect to be the leader?${prompt};Are you sure...are you sure you're not currrsed by ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}?${prompt}
I'm sure the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network would make for...excellent customers in the future.${prompt};Can never be too carrreful these days...${prompt}

Please check the settings and try a-again...;Huh? Arciela? That little waif of a princess? Granted, I'm quite pretty as well...${prompt}
Mmph...${prompt};Urk...I'd have expected you to go with the joke...${prompt}
Ahaha! Who can ever resist a good joke?;But let's get down to business.${prompt}
It's me, and no other!${prompt};I'm Flaviria, maester of Adoulin's Mummers' Coalition.${prompt}
How do you react?;I'm Flaviria, of course. I'm sure you've been to the Mummers' Coalition more than once, so my name should be quite familiar.${prompt}
${selection-lines};The Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network invited me to be a Unity leader...and how could I say no?${prompt}
Flaviria?;Though truth be told, I wonder why they picked me over one of the other leaders of the twelve orders.${prompt}
Arciela?;Now that I think of it, didn't you trounce one of our more enigmatic patrons in a game of Boom or Bust?${prompt}
Who?${prompt};And here I thought that the man in black couldn't be bested.${prompt}
Oho, expertly deduced! I'd expect no less!${prompt};I'd better brush up, or you'll be coming for me next!${prompt}
Huh? Arciela? That little waif of a princess? Granted, I'm quite pretty as well...${prompt};Either way, welcome to my Unity! I'm not completely clear on how best to proceed, but let's find the path together.${prompt}
Urk...I'd have expected you to go with the joke...${prompt};Ahem. <Cough-ethy>${prompt}
But let's get down to business.${prompt};So you're the young mind who's come to join-ethy my Unity?${prompt}
I'm Flaviria, maester of Adoulin's Mummers' Coalition.${prompt};Well met, I am Dr. Yoran-Oran, former minister-ethy of the Rhinostery in Windurst, and involved in all manner of magical research.${prompt}
I'm Flaviria, of course. I'm sure you've been to the Mummers' Coalition more than once, so my name should be quite familiar.${prompt};Ah, didn't you assist-ethy me with my mandragora research back then? Those items were of great help, thank you.${prompt}
The Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network invited me to be a Unity leader...and how could I say no?${prompt};Ah, I know that voice-ethy! ${name-player}, that's you, isn't it?${prompt}
Though truth be told, I wonder why they picked me over one of the other leaders of the twelve orders.${prompt};Your efforts-ethy saved the Great Star Tree. Windurst owes you a deep debt of gratitude.${prompt}
Now that I think of it, didn't you trounce one of our more enigmatic patrons in a game of Boom or Bust?${prompt};Listen ${name-player}. Those three monstrosities you so kindly brought into my life have put me in a very disconcerting situation-ethy. I have a lot more to say about it, but for now let's focus-ethy on the issue at hand.${prompt}
And here I thought that the man in black couldn't be bested.${prompt};Things have slowly gone back to normal-ethy now that the wretched trio of chaos incarnate has left. I've finally managed to begin work-ethy on my next book.${prompt}
I'd better brush up, or you'll be coming for me next!${prompt};Thank you again for your aid during the Shantotto crisis-ethy. Were it not for you, our entire dimension would have been twisted and defiled beyond recognition. I still get nightmares-ethy thinking about it.${prompt}
Either way, welcome to my Unity! I'm not completely clear on how best to proceed, but let's find the path together.${prompt};You see, I have many students who regularly come-ethy to me to learn from my vast well of knowledge, but the students who buy my books are by far the best-ethy.${prompt}
Ahem. <Cough-ethy>${prompt};One of these students was part of the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network-ethy and invited me to become a Unity leader.${prompt}
So you're the young mind who's come to join-ethy my Unity?${prompt};I hesitated, of course. Wasting my intellectual prowess in the adventuring business-ethy didn't seem fitting for a scholar like myself.${prompt}
Well met, I am Dr. Yoran-Oran, former minister-ethy of the Rhinostery in Windurst, and involved in all manner of magical research.${prompt};But then I thought-ethy some more.${prompt}
Ah, didn't you assist-ethy me with my mandragora research back then? Those items were of great help, thank you.${prompt};Could this in fact be the perfect-ethy avenue to promote my glorious research?${prompt}
Ah, I know that voice-ethy! ${name-player}, that's you, isn't it?${prompt};With this flawless object in mind, I've decided-ethy to accept the nomination as Unity leader.${prompt}
Your efforts-ethy saved the Great Star Tree. Windurst owes you a deep debt of gratitude.${prompt};And as Unity leader, I hope none of you will reproach-ethy me if I happen to plug my new book every now and again-ethy.${prompt}

And as Unity leader, I hope none of you will reproach-ethy me if I happen to plug my new book every now and again-ethy.${prompt};I know Daddy's training can be rough, but it looks like you passed his test with flying pigs...is that how you say that?${prompt}
.........${prompt};Did you know that Daddy would speak really highly of you? He would always talk about how a promising new geomancer showed up and was looking forward to seeing what you could do... He seemed so happy.${prompt}
Oh! Right! I should probably say something.;I can still feel your Communion. If it weren't for you back there, we would have been domed, I mean doomed. Anyway, thank you ${name-player}.${prompt}
I'm Sylvie. As you can probably guess from these clothes. I'm a geomanger--I mean, geomancer!${prompt};It's all thanks to you that we were able to fulfill Zacariah's duty. You're like the most...stupenderrific hero to all us Zacariahs!${prompt}
Oh, I forgot...you can't see my clothes, right? Forget I said that, okay?${prompt};So...I guess this mean you'll be joining my Unity?${prompt}
Oh, huh?;Thank you so much. It means a lot to me.
${name-player}? Is that ${name-player}?${prompt};As a representative for geomancers everywhere, I want our Unity to be the most geomancerrific. I mean, the best Unity that it can be.${prompt}
Oh, ${name-player}, it's you.${prompt};Ikhi said this wasn't a good time for me to be leading a Unity.${prompt}
${name-player}! It's ${name-player}!${prompt};But...I couldn't just stay at home doing nothing. It's easier to forget the sad things when you've got a lot to do, you know?${prompt}
How are you getting along with your luopan? Have you gotten used to using Colures, yet? If you keep your head and shoulders to the grindstone I'm sure you'll master it!${prompt};So when the offer for Unity leader came, I had to accept.${prompt}
I know Daddy's training can be rough, but it looks like you passed his test with flying pigs...is that how you say that?${prompt};You can't stay blue forever. Daddy would probably laugh at me if he saw how down and depressivated I am these days.${prompt}
Did you know that Daddy would speak really highly of you? He would always talk about how a promising new geomancer showed up and was looking forward to seeing what you could do... He seemed so happy.${prompt};...Right, smile Sylvie! Let's make this Unity work. With you as part of the team, I'm sure our efforts will bring us bear fruit.
I can still feel your Communion. If it weren't for you back there, we would have been domed, I mean doomed. Anyway, thank you ${name-player}.${prompt};Huh...why do they call it “bear fruit”?${prompt}
It's all thanks to you that we were able to fulfill Zacariah's duty. You're like the most...stupenderrific hero to all us Zacariahs!${prompt};Wait, so does this mean you'll be joining my Unity?${prompt}
So...I guess this mean you'll be joining my Unity?${prompt};As a representative for geomancers everywhere, I want our Unity to be the most geomancerrific. I mean, the best Unity that it can be.${prompt}

As a representative for geomancers everywhere, I want our Unity to be the most geomancerrific. I mean, the best Unity that it can be.${prompt};To tell you the truth, I wasn't sure what to do when the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network first invited me.${prompt}
Ikhi said this wasn't a good time for me to be leading a Unity.${prompt};If it weren't for Ikhi's guidance, I'd be down a creek full of paddles.${prompt}
But...I couldn't just stay at home doing nothing. It's easier to forget the sad things when you've got a lot to do, you know?${prompt};She said if the Unity could show people everywhere how to communicate with nature and spread the ways of the geomancer, then it was something worth doing.${prompt}
So when the offer for Unity leader came, I had to accept.${prompt};There's still a lot I don't know as a geomancer, but I'm going to triple down and do my best as UL.${prompt}
You can't stay blue forever. Daddy would probably laugh at me if he saw how down and depressivated I am these days.${prompt};Let's make this the best Unity we can!${prompt}

Nothing.${prompt};I know all about your talentaru, and if she chose you too, it must mean you have the qualifications necessary to make the shield.${prompt}

What is the quality? (1-1000);I actually received some notes on the topic-wopic of Craftsmanship. Please bear with me while I go over them.${prompt}
${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]}: ${number: 1}${prompt};You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} equipped.${prompt}
Oh, hello-wello. What is that shield you are carrying?${prompt};Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.${prompt}
Oh! I see you must have had a meeting-weeting with her already.${prompt};In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.${prompt}
Yes, I have heard all aboutaru it. It is a shield that can increase one's crafting abilities. I was quite surprised when I heard the story.${prompt};You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...${prompt}
If that story is for real-weal, then I definitely would like to see it for myself.${prompt};So, did you find that little tidbitaru of information useful?${prompt}
I know all about your talentaru, and if she chose you too, it must mean you have the qualifications necessary to make the shield.${prompt};Once the Craftsmanship is high enough, come to me and I will make you the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Now, allow me to teach you the recipe-wecipe.${prompt};After that, you'll need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} nextaru, which you can obtain from Julissois.${prompt}
So, with this particular ingredientaru list, you first need to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};I assume you are no stranger-wranger to making deliveries. That is basically how you will get the ingredients you need.${prompt}
This item is needed to boostaru the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its full potential.${prompt};You can speak with Julissois for more information.${prompt}
I actually received some notes on the topic-wopic of Craftsmanship. Please bear with me while I go over them.${prompt};That covers the ingredient listaru. Please bring the shield by once you have made the upgrade. I'm curious to see it for myself.${prompt}
You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} equipped.${prompt};Hm? You say you forgotaru the recipe already? Wait just a moment and I will get you the list again. Professional craftsmen really need to remember these kinds of things.${prompt}
Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.${prompt};You have worked hard to master your craftaru. I have faith that you can handle this.${prompt}
In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.${prompt};I see... That's the ticketaru. I should be able to use this to make the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...${prompt};This mustaru be the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
So, did you find that little tidbitaru of information useful?${prompt};I am not sure how the whole thing works, but it is amazing to think that I can pour my soul-woul into this shield somehow.${prompt}
Once the Craftsmanship is high enough, come to me and I will make you the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};Oh, it seems that when the ${item-singular: 0[2]} was wroughtaru, it somehow reduced the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
After that, you'll need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} nextaru, which you can obtain from Julissois.${prompt};That is not a problem if you wantaru to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but if you need to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you would need to increase the Craftsmanship again.${prompt}
I assume you are no stranger-wranger to making deliveries. That is basically how you will get the ingredients you need.${prompt};Of course, you're not the type to lose something so valuable-waluable and need to replace it.${prompt}
You can speak with Julissois for more information.${prompt};Impossible. You mean to tell me that you actually lostaru the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}
That covers the ingredient listaru. Please bring the shield by once you have made the upgrade. I'm curious to see it for myself.${prompt};Well, I suppose these things happen-wappen. I'll make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}, so please let me borrow your shield.${prompt}
Hm? You say you forgotaru the recipe already? Wait just a moment and I will get you the list again. Professional craftsmen really need to remember these kinds of things.${prompt};You are a professional craftsman. As such, it should not be so difficultaru to take care of your ingredients.${prompt}
You have worked hard to master your craftaru. I have faith that you can handle this.${prompt};It appears you made the upgrade without incidentaru. Do you mind if I take a look?${prompt}
I see... That's the ticketaru. I should be able to use this to make the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};Oh... I can see that it has changed, and it is giving off a faintaru energy. However, you can tell that it is not complete yet.${prompt}
This mustaru be the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};No, you must craft it multiple-wultiple times in order to achieve the level you seek. That is what she told me anyway.${prompt}
I am not sure how the whole thing works, but it is amazing to think that I can pour my soul-woul into this shield somehow.${prompt};That reminds me... She asked for some kind of sign after the shield is complete. Please give me a momentaru.${prompt}
Oh, it seems that when the ${item-singular: 0[2]} was wroughtaru, it somehow reduced the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};That should do it.${prompt}
That is not a problem if you wantaru to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but if you need to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you would need to increase the Craftsmanship again.${prompt};Now, take this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and everything will be perfectaru.${prompt}
Of course, you're not the type to lose something so valuable-waluable and need to replace it.${prompt};Oh, justaru one more thing. I often have deliveries for Julissois, and would appreciate it if you could help me train the younger members of the guild.${prompt}
Impossible. You mean to tell me that you actually lostaru the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};Welcome. Our mutual friend told me you would be paying me a visitaru.${prompt}
Well, I suppose these things happen-wappen. I'll make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}, so please let me borrow your shield.${prompt};You're here to upgrade your shield, right? Firstaru, you'll need to learn the recipe.${prompt}
You are a professional craftsman. As such, it should not be so difficultaru to take care of your ingredients.${prompt};You're awfully quietaru. Did you get that?${prompt}
It appears you made the upgrade without incidentaru. Do you mind if I take a look?${prompt};As for the listaru of ingredients, the first thing you'll need is the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Oh... I can see that it has changed, and it is giving off a faintaru energy. However, you can tell that it is not complete yet.${prompt};You'll need to equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} while you craftaru until you boost its Craftsmanship to 100%.${prompt}
No, you must craft it multiple-wultiple times in order to achieve the level you seek. That is what she told me anyway.${prompt};Do you remember equipping the aspis while you were crafting before? This is basically the same conceptaru.${prompt}
That reminds me... She asked for some kind of sign after the shield is complete. Please give me a momentaru.${prompt};Once it reaches 100%, bring it to me so I can inspectaru it and make the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
That should do it.${prompt};Next is the ${item-singular: 2[2]} and the ${item-singular: 3[2]}. You are familiar with the ${item-singular: 3[2]} from before. You can requestaru both of them from Julissois.${prompt}
Now, take this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and everything will be perfectaru.${prompt};The lastaru thing you'll need is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. Together with the A.M.A.N., I've prepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt}
Oh, justaru one more thing. I often have deliveries for Julissois, and would appreciate it if you could help me train the younger members of the guild.${prompt};You can refer to the Records of Eminence menu for additional information. Once you complete all of them, you will receive a perfectaru ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt}
Welcome. Our mutual friend told me you would be paying me a visitaru.${prompt};That concludes my explanation on the ingredients. You are a person of great talentaru. I know you'll do an excellent job.${prompt}
You're here to upgrade your shield, right? Firstaru, you'll need to learn the recipe.${prompt};Oh, it looks like you've given a nice boostaru to the shield's Craftsmanship.${prompt}
You're awfully quietaru. Did you get that?${prompt};Now, please waitaru while I make the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt}
As for the listaru of ingredients, the first thing you'll need is the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};Okay, here you go.${prompt}
You'll need to equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} while you craftaru until you boost its Craftsmanship to 100%.${prompt};Ahh, it's just as I thoughtaru. Making the ${item-singular: 0[2]} caused the shield's Craftsmanship to decrease.${prompt}
Do you remember equipping the aspis while you were crafting before? This is basically the same conceptaru.${prompt};Therefore, make sure you take good care of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} so you don't have to craftaru it multiple times.${prompt}
Once it reaches 100%, bring it to me so I can inspectaru it and make the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};My my! I'm not usually one to make shields, but even I can tell this one is of high quality! You truly are an expertaru craftsman!${prompt}
Next is the ${item-singular: 2[2]} and the ${item-singular: 3[2]}. You are familiar with the ${item-singular: 3[2]} from before. You can requestaru both of them from Julissois.${prompt};Indeed, I can sense greataru power coming from it compared to the last one you made.${prompt}
The lastaru thing you'll need is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. Together with the A.M.A.N., I've prepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt};Now, before I forgetaru, allow me to mark the shield so you can take it back to her.${prompt}
You can refer to the Records of Eminence menu for additional information. Once you complete all of them, you will receive a perfectaru ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt};There, all finished. Take this shield to Mewk Chorosap and you'll be set.${prompt}
That concludes my explanation on the ingredients. You are a person of great talentaru. I know you'll do an excellent job.${prompt};This kind of thing happens to all of us. You can have another try at the final objective, so make sure you get it rightaru this time.${prompt}
Oh, it looks like you've given a nice boostaru to the shield's Craftsmanship.${prompt};Well, well, look who's chomping at the bitaru. Let's get down to business, then.${prompt}
Now, please waitaru while I make the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt};Ah, so you know the recipe already? Then I'll share with you something you might not know.${prompt}
Okay, here you go.${prompt};It's about how to get ${item-plural: 4[2]} and ${item-plural: 5[2]}.${prompt}
Ahh, it's just as I thoughtaru. Making the ${item-singular: 0[2]} caused the shield's Craftsmanship to decrease.${prompt};You've got to take orders-worders from the guild and bring them to the person who placed them.${prompt}
Therefore, make sure you take good care of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} so you don't have to craftaru it multiple times.${prompt};Not only do they have an eye for quality, but they want to see the artisan at work up close.${prompt}
My my! I'm not usually one to make shields, but even I can tell this one is of high quality! You truly are an expertaru craftsman!${prompt};For the most part, they'll only acceptaru items that you made right at their side.${prompt}
Indeed, I can sense greataru power coming from it compared to the last one you made.${prompt};And you will have to procure the materials yourself. I presume this doesn't pose a problem?${prompt}
Now, before I forgetaru, allow me to mark the shield so you can take it back to her.${prompt};The good news is that some products have been made available at other guilds.${prompt}
There, all finished. Take this shield to Mewk Chorosap and you'll be set.${prompt};Among these, of course, are synthesis kitarus.${prompt}
This kind of thing happens to all of us. You can have another try at the final objective, so make sure you get it rightaru this time.${prompt};Of course, it's anyone's guess as to whether or not they'll be in stock.${prompt}
Well, well, look who's chomping at the bitaru. Let's get down to business, then.${prompt};I'll give you ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]} once you have filled all the orders.${prompt}
Ah, so you know the recipe already? Then I'll share with you something you might not know.${prompt};Here is the ${choice: 0}[first/second/last] order.${prompt}
It's about how to get ${item-plural: 4[2]} and ${item-plural: 5[2]}.${prompt};Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Nouveil in ${unknown: 0x01053782E78180}.${prompt}
You've got to take orders-worders from the guild and bring them to the person who placed them.${prompt};Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Yaman-Hachuman in the Orastery in ${unknown: 0x01053782F08180}.${prompt}
Not only do they have an eye for quality, but they want to see the artisan at work up close.${prompt};Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Yaman-Hachuman in the Orastery in ${unknown: 0x01053782F08180}.${prompt}
For the most part, they'll only acceptaru items that you made right at their side.${prompt};Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Nouveil in ${unknown: 0x01053782E78180}.${prompt}
And you will have to procure the materials yourself. I presume this doesn't pose a problem?${prompt};For those, it doesn't matter whether or not you make it at their side.${prompt}
The good news is that some products have been made available at other guilds.${prompt};Report back once you have delivered-wivered the items.${prompt}
Among these, of course, are synthesis kitarus.${prompt};Your current requestaru is...${prompt}
Of course, it's anyone's guess as to whether or not they'll be in stock.${prompt};How is everything going?${prompt}
I'll give you ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]} once you have filled all the orders.${prompt};How is your progress?
Here is the ${choice: 0}[first/second/last] order.${prompt};${selection-lines}
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Nouveil in ${unknown: 0x01053782E78180}.${prompt};Fine.
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Yaman-Hachuman in the Orastery in ${unknown: 0x01053782F08180}.${prompt};I give up.${prompt}
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Yaman-Hachuman in the Orastery in ${unknown: 0x01053782F08180}.${prompt};Glad-wad to hear it!${prompt}
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Nouveil in ${unknown: 0x01053782E78180}.${prompt};Terrible news indeed! Are you sure there's nothing to be done?${prompt}
For those, it doesn't matter whether or not you make it at their side.${prompt};Really give up?
Report back once you have delivered-wivered the items.${prompt};${selection-lines}
Your current requestaru is...${prompt};Not yet.
How is everything going?${prompt};Yes.${prompt}
How is your progress?;That's too bad-wad. I'll just have to get someone else to fill the order.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Not that I can blame you for wanting a break. Let me know when you change your mind.${prompt}
Fine.;I trust that everything is going well? Let me give you your next assignment.${prompt}
I give up.${prompt};I've received work that the order was successfully filled-willed. Well done!${prompt}
Glad-wad to hear it!${prompt};I've received work that the order was successfully filled-willed. Well done!${prompt}
Terrible news indeed! Are you sure there's nothing to be done?${prompt};As promised, let me present you wtih ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Really give up?;If you lose them, I can have them replaced...for a fee.${prompt}
${selection-lines};You've gotten quite the hang of this, haven'taru you?${prompt}
Not yet.;Ah, yes! The shield!${prompt}
Yes.${prompt};Well, it looks fabulous indeed, and much lighter than I would have pictured.${prompt}
That's too bad-wad. I'll just have to get someone else to fill the order.${prompt};I can barely wait to see what the next stage will bring with it!${prompt}
Not that I can blame you for wanting a break. Let me know when you change your mind.${prompt};Ah, but perhaps now you have learned the innermost secrets of weaving. Why not give them a go?${prompt}
I trust that everything is going well? Let me give you your next assignment.${prompt};Hello, friend. I see that you are ready-weady to take on the final upgrade.${prompt}
I've received work that the order was successfully filled-willed. Well done!${prompt};Now then, let me explain aboutaru how to obtain the necessary materials.${prompt}
I've received work that the order was successfully filled-willed. Well done!${prompt};The firstaru two things you'll need are ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}
As promised, let me present you wtih ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};I have asked Julissois to hold-wold them for me. You simply need to exchange crafter points for them.${prompt}
If you lose them, I can have them replaced...for a fee.${prompt};The other material-waterial you'll require is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. I can produce it for you once your shield's Craftsmanship reaches 100%.${prompt}
You've gotten quite the hang of this, haven'taru you?${prompt};That's it for my explanation. This being the last step, I thought it'd be a more difficultaru undertaking, but I guess not. Do be careful though.${prompt}
Ah, yes! The shield!${prompt};I heard that Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno requires the ${item-singular: 0[2]} when it's finished-winished. Please try not to lose it.${prompt}
Well, it looks fabulous indeed, and much lighter than I would have pictured.${prompt};Ahh, welcome. Can I help you with something-womething?${prompt}
I can barely wait to see what the next stage will bring with it!${prompt};I see... The item you're looking for was a special requestaru made by a Tarutaru from Adoulin.${prompt}
Ah, but perhaps now you have learned the innermost secrets of weaving. Why not give them a go?${prompt};We have a rather difficultaru situation here. I already sent it to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.${prompt}
Hello, friend. I see that you are ready-weady to take on the final upgrade.${prompt};Therefore, I suppose you should visitaru Jeuno once again and see if it has been delivered.${prompt}
Now then, let me explain aboutaru how to obtain the necessary materials.${prompt};Ah, you came at just the rightaru time. I found that item you were looking for stuck in my loom.${prompt}
The firstaru two things you'll need are ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt};Hm? You need this thing? Yes, it was for you all along, so I don't see any problem-wroblem with you taking it.${prompt}
I have asked Julissois to hold-wold them for me. You simply need to exchange crafter points for them.${prompt};Ahh, welcome. This must be it...${prompt}
The other material-waterial you'll require is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. I can produce it for you once your shield's Craftsmanship reaches 100%.${prompt};Yes, the shield is quite amazing. I can tell justaru how much work has gone into its creation.${prompt}
That's it for my explanation. This being the last step, I thought it'd be a more difficultaru undertaking, but I guess not. Do be careful though.${prompt};The guild emblem that I worked so hard to lovingly-wovingly craft is nicely on display. It turned out even better than I expected.${prompt}
I heard that Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno requires the ${item-singular: 0[2]} when it's finished-winished. Please try not to lose it.${prompt};Now that you're finished, I would like to teach-weach you this new crafting technique.${prompt}
Ahh, welcome. Can I help you with something-womething?${prompt};I know that you will be able to use this technique to further hone your craftaru. I look forward to seeing what you can become.${prompt}
I see... The item you're looking for was a special requestaru made by a Tarutaru from Adoulin.${prompt};0: ${number: 0} 1: ${number: 1} 2: ${number: 2} 3: ${number: 3}${prompt}
We have a rather difficultaru situation here. I already sent it to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.${prompt};Oh, it's you again. What's the storrry behind that shield?${prompt}
Therefore, I suppose you should visitaru Jeuno once again and see if it has been delivered.${prompt};Hmm... I see you've spoken with her. Like me, you're quite currrious about things.${prompt}
Ah, you came at just the rightaru time. I found that item you were looking for stuck in my loom.${prompt};According to her, that shield can boost one's crafting ability. If it's true, that's quite an incrrredible feat.${prompt}
Hm? You need this thing? Yes, it was for you all along, so I don't see any problem-wroblem with you taking it.${prompt};That's the shield, yes? I have the recipe, so I suppose I could do it if I had the time... I'm really busy, you see.${prompt}
Ahh, welcome. This must be it...${prompt};I know... She gave you the shield, yes? You're quite skilled at our crrraft, so how about you give it a try? Yes, it's settled then!${prompt}
Yes, the shield is quite amazing. I can tell justaru how much work has gone into its creation.${prompt};Listen up now. I'm going to teach you the rrrecipe, so pay attention.${prompt}
The guild emblem that I worked so hard to lovingly-wovingly craft is nicely on display. It turned out even better than I expected.${prompt};So, firrrst, you'll need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to get started.${prompt}
Now that you're finished, I would like to teach-weach you this new crafting technique.${prompt};Its purrrpose is to boost the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its full value.${prompt}
I know that you will be able to use this technique to further hone your craftaru. I look forward to seeing what you can become.${prompt};Wait a moment. I have some notes on Craftsmanship that you should hear, so listen carrrefully.${prompt}
0: ${number: 0} 1: ${number: 1} 2: ${number: 2} 3: ${number: 3}${prompt};Did you catch all of that?${prompt}
Oh, it's you again. What's the storrry behind that shield?${prompt};Come see me when you've incrrreased the Craftsmanship rating. I'll make you the ${item-singular: 1[2]} that you require.${prompt}
Hmm... I see you've spoken with her. Like me, you're quite currrious about things.${prompt};Next on your list are ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. You can get them by speaking to Tergil.${prompt}
According to her, that shield can boost one's crafting ability. If it's true, that's quite an incrrredible feat.${prompt};I imagine you've made deliveries for people, yes? This is basically the same idea.${prompt}
That's the shield, yes? I have the recipe, so I suppose I could do it if I had the time... I'm really busy, you see.${prompt};You can speak to Tergil for furrrther details.${prompt}
I know... She gave you the shield, yes? You're quite skilled at our crrraft, so how about you give it a try? Yes, it's settled then!${prompt};That's it for the ingredients. Come show me the shield after it's been upgraded. I'm currrious to see it for myself.${prompt}
Listen up now. I'm going to teach you the rrrecipe, so pay attention.${prompt};Hm? You forrrgot the recipe already? Okay, here's the list again. Remember, skilled craftsmen only need to hear this once.${prompt}
So, firrrst, you'll need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to get started.${prompt};You've managed to match even my skill as a craftsman. I'm prrretty confident that you can make this shield.${prompt}
Its purrrpose is to boost the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its full value.${prompt};Yes, very well done indeed! With this, I can make the ${item-singular: 0[2]} no prrroblem.${prompt}
Wait a moment. I have some notes on Craftsmanship that you should hear, so listen carrrefully.${prompt};So, this is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Did you catch all of that?${prompt};The technique to imbue a craftsman's soul into the shield to form a crystal... It makes no sense to me, but I can definitely feel its power.${prompt}
Come see me when you've incrrreased the Craftsmanship rating. I'll make you the ${item-singular: 1[2]} that you require.${prompt};Hmm... It appears that by creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, it also reduced the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Next on your list are ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. You can get them by speaking to Tergil.${prompt};That's fine if you only need to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but you'll have to raise the Craftsmanship if you want to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
I imagine you've made deliveries for people, yes? This is basically the same idea.${prompt};Of course, it's not like you'd ever need to do such a thing. Not someone as rrresponsible as you.${prompt}
You can speak to Tergil for furrrther details.${prompt};I don't believe it... You'rrre telling me that you lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}
That's it for the ingredients. Come show me the shield after it's been upgraded. I'm currrious to see it for myself.${prompt};Oh well. These things happen I guess. Let me see the shield. I'll crrraft you another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Hm? You forrrgot the recipe already? Okay, here's the list again. Remember, skilled craftsmen only need to hear this once.${prompt};You're an elite craftsman now. You need to take better care of your ingrrredients or you'll never get any work.${prompt}
You've managed to match even my skill as a craftsman. I'm prrretty confident that you can make this shield.${prompt};It seems you made the upgrrrade. Here, let me see how you did.${prompt}
Yes, very well done indeed! With this, I can make the ${item-singular: 0[2]} no prrroblem.${prompt};Hmm... I can see the differrrence and feel its power, but it's clearly not finished yet.${prompt}
So, this is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};I'm sure she's already told you that you'll need to craft multiple times in order to achieve the expected rrresults.${prompt}
The technique to imbue a craftsman's soul into the shield to form a crystal... It makes no sense to me, but I can definitely feel its power.${prompt};Oh yes... You need proof that the shield is complete. Wait just a moment and I'll get that rrready for you.${prompt}
Hmm... It appears that by creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, it also reduced the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};That should do it.${prompt}
That's fine if you only need to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but you'll have to raise the Craftsmanship if you want to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};Simply show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and you'rrre all set.${prompt}
Of course, it's not like you'd ever need to do such a thing. Not someone as rrresponsible as you.${prompt};Oh, one more thing. I often have deliveries for Tergil. I hope you'll agrrree to help me train the newer guild members.${prompt}
I don't believe it... You'rrre telling me that you lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};Hello therrre. Yes, I've been expecting you after speaking with you know who.${prompt}
Oh well. These things happen I guess. Let me see the shield. I'll crrraft you another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};This is the recipe you'll need. Do try to rrremember it, will you?${prompt}
You're an elite craftsman now. You need to take better care of your ingrrredients or you'll never get any work.${prompt};I hope you didn't forrrget that already.${prompt}
It seems you made the upgrrrade. Here, let me see how you did.${prompt};Now, let's discuss how to obtain the ingredients. Firrrst, you'll need to start with the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Hmm... I can see the differrrence and feel its power, but it's clearly not finished yet.${prompt};You used this before, no? Like with the aspis, you'll need to crrraft while equipping the ${item-singular: 0[2]} in order to boost the shield's Craftsmanship.${prompt}
I'm sure she's already told you that you'll need to craft multiple times in order to achieve the expected rrresults.${prompt};This time, though, you'll need to put in a little more effort.${prompt}
Oh yes... You need proof that the shield is complete. Wait just a moment and I'll get that rrready for you.${prompt};Once you have increased the Craftsmanship to its maximum level, come see me and I'll crrreate the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt}
That should do it.${prompt};Next, you need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. Do you remember the ${item-singular: 3[2]} frrrom before? I've given both of them to Tergil.${prompt}
Simply show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and you'rrre all set.${prompt};Last is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. With the help of the A.M.A.N., I've prrrepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt}
Oh, one more thing. I often have deliveries for Tergil. I hope you'll agrrree to help me train the newer guild members.${prompt};You can rrrefer to the Records of Eminence menu for more details. Once you've cleared them all, you'll get the ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt}
Hello therrre. Yes, I've been expecting you after speaking with you know who.${prompt};That's it. I know it's harrrd work gathering all of these ingredients, but you've been through worse, no? I know you'll be fine!${prompt}
This is the recipe you'll need. Do try to rrremember it, will you?${prompt};Oh, it seems the shield's Craftsmanship has drrropped.${prompt}
I hope you didn't forrrget that already.${prompt};Wait just a moment. I'll have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you beforrre long.${prompt}
Now, let's discuss how to obtain the ingredients. Firrrst, you'll need to start with the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};Ahh, it turned out just perrrfectly.${prompt}
You used this before, no? Like with the aspis, you'll need to crrraft while equipping the ${item-singular: 0[2]} in order to boost the shield's Craftsmanship.${prompt};Ahh... It looks like crrreating the ${item-singular: 0[2]} has once again caused the shield's Craftsmanship to drop.${prompt}
This time, though, you'll need to put in a little more effort.${prompt};It is no easy task to increase its Craftsmanship, so keep it in a safe place until you're rrready to use it, understood?${prompt}
Once you have increased the Craftsmanship to its maximum level, come see me and I'll crrreate the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt};Hah... Something about this shield is quite fascinating. Did you use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or something?${prompt}
Next, you need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. Do you remember the ${item-singular: 3[2]} frrrom before? I've given both of them to Tergil.${prompt};Yes, I can sense the power of this new shield. It feels rrremarkably different from the previous one.${prompt}
Last is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. With the help of the A.M.A.N., I've prrrepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt};Here, allow me to marrrk it for when you show it to her.${prompt}
You can rrrefer to the Records of Eminence menu for more details. Once you've cleared them all, you'll get the ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt};Therrre you go. Take this shield to Mewk Chorosap to complete your task.${prompt}
That's it. I know it's harrrd work gathering all of these ingredients, but you've been through worse, no? I know you'll be fine!${prompt};This simply will not do. You'rrre going to need to face the final objective once again.${prompt}
Oh, it seems the shield's Craftsmanship has drrropped.${prompt};You've done well. Now, let's go over the next rrrecipe.${prompt}
Wait just a moment. I'll have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you beforrre long.${prompt};What's this? You alrrready know the recipe and how to obtain some of the ingredients? Well, this should go quickly then.${prompt}
Ahh, it turned out just perrrfectly.${prompt};That just leaves the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}. Very well then.${prompt}
Ahh... It looks like crrreating the ${item-singular: 0[2]} has once again caused the shield's Craftsmanship to drop.${prompt};We have some customers coming to orrrder items from us, so I'm going to have you make the items near them and make the delivery.${prompt}
It is no easy task to increase its Craftsmanship, so keep it in a safe place until you're rrready to use it, understood?${prompt};It seems many of our customers are quite knowledgeable about boneworking, so they want to see our craftsmen's work up close and perrrsonal.${prompt}
Hah... Something about this shield is quite fascinating. Did you use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or something?${prompt};As such, only items made in front of the customer will be accepted, although there are some exceptions to this rrrule.${prompt}
Yes, I can sense the power of this new shield. It feels rrremarkably different from the previous one.${prompt};Forrrgive me, but you'll need to gather the necessary materials to create the item yourself. Fortunately, it doesn't matter how you get them.${prompt}
Here, allow me to marrrk it for when you show it to her.${prompt};By the way, we've reached an agrrreement with the other guilds to buy and sell items that aren't normally available, assuming you have the money.${prompt}
Therrre you go. Take this shield to Mewk Chorosap to complete your task.${prompt};You can see the items available in this area by speaking to each guild's crafting set vendor. I suppose it'll prrrove quite useful for you.${prompt}
This simply will not do. You'rrre going to need to face the final objective once again.${prompt};Although, note that each guild is free to set its own rrrules, so you may not always be able to get what you want.${prompt}
You've done well. Now, let's go over the next rrrecipe.${prompt};Once you complete all of the customer requests, I'll give you the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]} as prrromised. Good luck out there.${prompt}
What's this? You alrrready know the recipe and how to obtain some of the ingredients? Well, this should go quickly then.${prompt};This is the ${choice: 0}[first/next/last] request.${prompt}
That just leaves the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}. Very well then.${prompt};Make a deliverrry of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Silver Owl at the Tenshodo in ${unknown: 0x01053782EC8180}.${prompt}
We have some customers coming to orrrder items from us, so I'm going to have you make the items near them and make the delivery.${prompt};Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Crooked Arrow in ${unknown: 0x01053782F38180}. You can find him in frrront of the Auction House.${prompt}
It seems many of our customers are quite knowledgeable about boneworking, so they want to see our craftsmen's work up close and perrrsonal.${prompt};Make a deliverrry of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Silver Owl at the Tenshodo in ${unknown: 0x01053782EC8180}.${prompt}
As such, only items made in front of the customer will be accepted, although there are some exceptions to this rrrule.${prompt};Make a deliverrry of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Pawkrix at Muckvix's Junk Shop in ${unknown: 0x01053782F58180}.${prompt}
Forrrgive me, but you'll need to gather the necessary materials to create the item yourself. Fortunately, it doesn't matter how you get them.${prompt};Oh, this is an item that doesn't need to be crrrafted near the customer.${prompt}
By the way, we've reached an agrrreement with the other guilds to buy and sell items that aren't normally available, assuming you have the money.${prompt};Don't forrrget to report back to me once you finish the request.${prompt}
You can see the items available in this area by speaking to each guild's crafting set vendor. I suppose it'll prrrove quite useful for you.${prompt};The current request you're worrrking on is...${prompt}
Although, note that each guild is free to set its own rrrules, so you may not always be able to get what you want.${prompt};How is the request coming along? Everything is going accorrrding to schedule?${prompt}
