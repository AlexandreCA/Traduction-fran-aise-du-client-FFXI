If you mention magic, then you think of Windurst, right? I was hoping to get the Rhinostery to check it out, so I came all the way here.${prompt};Si on parle de magie, on pense à Windurst, non ? J'espérais que le Rhinostery l'examine, alors je suis venu jusqu'ici.${prompt}
But now that I've lost the rock in question, I'm stumped. After all the dangers I went through to get my hands on that rock, too... Boy, am I at my wits' end!${prompt};Mais maintenant que j'ai perdu la pierre en question, je suis perplexe. Après tous les dangers que j'ai traversés pour mettre la main sur cette pierre... Je suis vraiment à bout de nerfs !${prompt}
I spread the word that I'd pay a reward to the one who finds my ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but didn't get a single response.${prompt};J’ai annoncé que je paierais une récompense à celui qui retrouverait mon ${item-singular: 1[2]}, mais je n’ai reçu aucune réponse.${prompt}
Guess I'll have to go back to the depths of the Palborough Mines and dig up another one...but that place is so dangerous, and...how can I show my face in Bastok!?${prompt};Je vais devoir retourner dans les profondeurs des Mines de Palborough et en déterrer une autre... mais cet endroit est tellement dangereux, et... comment puis-je montrer mon visage à Bastok !?${prompt}
Oh...! Ooohhhww...!;Oh...! Ooohhhww...!
Just when I had given up hope, too! Thank you! Thank you ever so much!${prompt};Juste au moment où j'avais perdu tout espoir ! Merci ! Merci beaucoup !${prompt}
How can I ever repay you? Words cannot express my gratitude, so here, please accept this...${prompt};Comment puis-je jamais te rembourser ? Les mots ne peuvent exprimer ma gratitude, alors accepte ceci, s'il te plaît...${prompt}
Now I can show my face in Bastok again! Words will never express my gratitude...;Maintenant, je peux montrer mon visage à Bastok à nouveau ! Les mots ne pourront jamais exprimer ma gratitude...
Just...thank you!${prompt};Juste... merci !${prompt}
Thanks for your help the other day! I took that stone and left it with the Rhinostery.${prompt};Merci pour ton aide l'autre jour ! J'ai pris cette pierre et l'ai laissée au Rhinostery.${prompt}
Guess I'll just do some sightseeing until the results come back. Then again...I've already seen every nook and cranny of this place while I was searching frantically for the stone I lost!${prompt};Je vais juste faire un peu de tourisme en attendant les résultats. En fait... J'ai déjà vu chaque recoin de cet endroit en cherchant frénétiquement la pierre que j'avais perdue !${prompt}

What are you staring at? Haven't you ever seen a Mithra beforrre?${prompt};Qu’est-ce que vous regardez ? Vous n’avez jamais vu une Mithra avant ?${prompt}
Here in Windurst Woods, there arrre many Mithra. You'll soon get over it...${prompt};Ici dans les Bois de Windurst, il y a beaucoup de Mithra. Vous vous y habituerez bientôt...${prompt}
This is Windurst Woods, the Mithra part of town! We Mithra have to stick together, so feel welcome, frrriend!${prompt};C’est les Bois de Windurst, la partie de la ville des Mithra ! Nous, les Mithra, devons rester solidaires, alors sentez-vous le bienvenu, ami !${prompt}

Rrreally, now!?;Vraiment, maintenant !?
Of course, you can leave the rrreal monster-slaying work to Buuma's Boomers!${prompt};Bien sûr, vous pouvez laisser le vrai travail de chasse aux monstres aux Boomers de Buuma !${prompt}
I'd prefer to give you the work we find the most trying, such as the more delicate missions.

To protect the Mithra populace from all manner of threats and dangers...;Protéger la population Mithra de toutes sortes de menaces et dangers...
That is the job of us guards.${prompt};C'est le travail des gardes.${prompt}
But lately, ferocious monsters are on the increase, and the beastmen are rrruining nature as they please, so our job is becoming all the more hectic.${prompt};Mais ces derniers temps, les monstres féroces sont en augmentation, et les bêtes détruisent la nature à leur guise, donc notre travail devient de plus en plus hectique.${prompt}
If you are a citizen of Windurst, then perhaps you may lend us a helping hand from time to time in order to protect the peace of our fair town.${prompt};Si vous êtes citoyen de Windurst, peut-être pourriez-vous nous donner un coup de main de temps en temps afin de protéger la paix de notre belle ville.${prompt}
For instance, you could try to do some missions...special tasks issued on behalf of the Federation of Windurst...${prompt};Par exemple, vous pourriez essayer de faire des missions... des tâches spéciales émises au nom de la Fédération de Windurst...${prompt}
But first, you might prefer to listen to our explanation of the rrrole of gatehouses before you decide...${prompt};Mais d'abord, vous préféreriez peut-être écouter notre explication sur le rôle des guérites avant de décider...${prompt}
Hear explanation of gatehouses?;Écouter l'explication des guérites ?

Good, then allow us to explain. Sola Jaab, would you like to do the honors?${prompt};Bien, permettez-nous alors d'expliquer. Sola Jaab, voulez-vous vous charger de l'honneur ?${prompt}
Roger, Captain Buuma!;Bien reçu, Capitaine Buuma !

Well, put simply, the gatehouses are where we guards worrrk and rest.${prompt};En résumé, les guérites sont là où nous, les gardes, travaillons et nous reposons.${prompt}
We also administer missions herrre--assignments for and on behalf of our country.${prompt};Nous administrons également des missions ici - des missions pour et au nom de notre pays.${prompt}
Missions differ from plain quests in that they are rendered as service to your country, so the government will award you rank points forrr each mission you accomplish.${prompt};Les missions diffèrent des quêtes simples en ce qu'elles sont rendues comme un service à votre pays, donc le gouvernement vous accordera des points de rang pour chaque mission que vous accomplissez.${prompt}
Register enough points and your rank, or standing in society, will incrrrease.${prompt};Enregistrer suffisamment de points fera augmenter votre rang, ou votre position dans la société.${prompt}
So how about it?;Alors, qu'en pensez-vous ?
If you consider yourself a model citizen of Windurst, I rrrecommend you serve your country by trying your hand at missions.${prompt};Si vous vous considérez comme un citoyen modèle de Windurst, je vous recommande de servir votre pays en essayant votre chance avec les missions.${prompt}
The very rrreason that you came to Windurst in the first place was because you wanted to make something out of yourself, wasn't it?${prompt};La raison même pour laquelle vous êtes venu à Windurst en premier lieu était parce que vous vouliez vous faire une place, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}

Ex...excusey me...;Ex... excusez-moi...
But, I, erm, I know of a mission-wission...${prompt};Mais, euh, je connais une mission...${prompt}
You see...well...erm...;Vous voyez... eh bien... euh...
The Orastery in the port area is kinda looking for someone to help them with a magic experiment to be conducted at the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt};L'Orasterie dans la zone portuaire cherche un volontaire pour les aider dans une expérience magique à mener aux Ruines de Horutoto.${prompt}
I know it's a little sudden-wudden, but they said they were in a fix because they couldn't find anyone to help them. So, erm, how about it then...?${prompt};Je sais que c'est un peu soudain, mais ils ont dit qu'ils étaient dans l'embarras car ils ne trouvaient personne pour les aider. Alors, euh, qu'en pensez-vous... ?${prompt}
Good. Carry out that mission!;Bien. Effectuez cette mission !
The Orastery is the ministry that rrruns a Mage Academy to improve the military's magic abilities.${prompt};L'Orasterie est le ministère qui gère une Académie de Mages pour améliorer les capacités magiques de l'armée.${prompt}
To get to the Orastery, you have to go to the port area by heading back west from this gate. Your country is counting on you!${prompt};Pour accéder à l'Orasterie, vous devez vous rendre dans la zone portuaire en retournant vers l'ouest depuis cette guérite. Votre pays compte sur vous !${prompt}
I, erm, I have a friend who serves at the Orastery. H-he's so cool!;J'ai, euh, un ami qui sert à l'Orasterie. I-il est tellement cool !
Gee... I wish I could be m-more like him!${prompt};M-mais je souhaite pouvoir être p-plus comme lui !${prompt}
O-only the e-elite students from the School of Magic can go on to enter the Orastery. So, so the Tarutaru in the Orastery are the most brilliant magic users in the whole of Windurst!${prompt};Seuls les étudiants d'élite de l'École de Magie peuvent entrer à l'Orasterie. Donc, les Tarutaru à l'Orasterie sont les utilisateurs de magie les plus brillants de tout Windurst !${prompt}
The Horutoto Ruins are a bunch of old towerrrs out in Sarutabaruta.${prompt};Les Ruines de Horutoto sont un ensemble de vieilles tours dans Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
But they're all falling to pieces now...;Mais elles sont toutes en train de s'effondrer maintenant...
It was the Tarutaru who destrrroyed them. They insist it was all due to the Great Warrr, but that just sounds like halfling half-truths to me.${prompt};Ce sont les Tarutaru qui les ont détruites. Ils insistent sur le fait que c'était à cause de la Grande Guerre, mais ça ressemble juste à des demi-vérités halfling pour moi.${prompt}
You'rrre not s'posed to go straight to them magical towers, y'know? You'rrre s'posed to go to the O～rastery first...I think.${prompt};Vous n'êtes pas censé aller directement aux tours magiques, vous savez ? Vous êtes censé aller d'abord à l'Orasterie... je pense.${prompt}
The Orastery is in charge of the Mage Academy, y'know? That's where the Tarutaru practice their spells all day in order to perrrfect them. It's the big building in the port area...I think.${prompt};L'Orasterie est responsable de l'Académie des Mages, vous savez ? C'est là que les Tarutaru pratiquent leurs sorts toute la journée pour les perfectionner. C'est le grand bâtiment dans la zone portuaire... je pense.${prompt}
The details of the mission will be explained when you meet with the Orastery's minister. I can't say he's the most pleasant of people, but at least he has guts.${prompt};Les détails de la mission seront expliqués lorsque vous rencontrerez le ministre de l'Orasterie. Je ne peux pas dire qu'il soit la personne la plus agréable, mais au moins il a du cran.${prompt}
Do us proud!${prompt};Faites-nous honneur !${prompt}
Good job!;Bon travail !
Glad to see you made it back alive! I trust the mission wasn't too dangerous.${prompt};Content de voir que vous êtes revenu en vie ! J'espère que la mission n'était pas trop dangereuse.${prompt}
Allocating rrrank points according to your efforts...has enabled you to go up to rrrank two! Congratulations!${prompt};L'allocation des points de rang selon vos efforts... vous a permis de monter au rang deux ! Félicitations !${prompt}
Did you enjoy your little run-in with the ministerrr of the Orastery? Grrr... Oh, and were you able to meet his little sisterrr?${prompt};Avez-vous apprécié votre petit tête-à-tête avec le ministre de l'Orasterie ? Grrr... Oh, et avez-vous pu rencontrer sa petite sœur ?${prompt}
The Minister of the Orastery's sisterrr is named Apururu. You'd know if you met herrr. She's also the ministerrr of the Manustery.${prompt};La sœur du ministre de l'Orasterie s'appelle Apururu. Vous sauriez si vous l'aviez rencontrée. Elle est aussi la ministre de la Manasterie.${prompt}
Missions are all verrry well and good, but you should also try some quests too...I think!${prompt};Les missions sont très bien, mais vous devriez aussi essayer quelques quêtes... Je pense !${prompt}
Speaking to the townsfolk and trrrying to help them with their problems... It can be very beneficial, y'know!${prompt};Parler aux habitants et essayer de les aider avec leurs problèmes... Cela peut être très bénéfique, vous savez !${prompt}
You've come just at the rrright time. The Manustery just up the rrroad there is asking for help in making automaton guards at the Cardian workshop.${prompt};Vous arrivez juste au bon moment. La Manasterie juste là-bas demande de l'aide pour la fabrication de gardes automates à l'atelier de Cardians.${prompt}
Seeing as the Cardian workshop is rrright next door, you can hardly turn this mission down, can you?${prompt};Étant donné que l'atelier de Cardians est juste à côté, vous ne pouvez guère refuser cette mission, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Accept this mission?;Acceptez-vous cette mission ?
${selection-lines};${selection-lines}
Accept.;Accepter.
Decline.${prompt};Refuser.${prompt}
Ask the staff at the Cardian workshop for the details.${prompt};Demandez aux employés de l'atelier de Cardians les détails.${prompt}
The Manustery's Cardian workshop is straight back down that rrroad there, on the right-hand side of the Bomingo Round.${prompt};L'atelier de Cardians de la Manasterie est tout droit là-bas, sur le côté droit de la Bomingo Round.${prompt}
Rrreally?;Vraiment ?
Too bad, then.${prompt};Dommage alors.${prompt}
C-Cardians were invented to fight as magical puppet-like s-soldiers in the Great War of twenty-wenty years ago.${prompt};L-les Cardians ont été inventés pour combattre en tant que soldats magiques de type marionnette lors de la Grande Guerre d'il y a vingt ans.${prompt}
Th-thanks to the creation of the Cardians, Tarutaru and Mithra guards have come to suffer less injuries.${prompt};G-grâce à la création des Cardians, les gardes Tarutaru et Mithra ont moins souffert de blessures.${prompt}
Compared to us, Carrrdians are useless. They have no sense when it comes to fighting.${prompt};Comparés à nous, les Cardians sont inutiles. Ils n'ont aucun sens lorsqu'il s'agit de combattre.${prompt}
However, I'll say this about them...they have no fearrr of death. Even we Mithra aren't as darrring as they are. That could be a powerrrful advantage...${prompt};Cependant, je dirai ceci à leur sujet... ils n'ont pas peur de la mort. Même nous, Mithra, ne sommes pas aussi courageux qu'eux. Cela pourrait être un avantage puissant...${prompt}
Go right down that road therrre, and when you come out into the round, you'll see a larrrge building up on your right...I think. Well, that's the Manustery's Cardian workshop, y'know?${prompt};Allez tout droit dans cette rue là-bas, et quand vous arrivez à la ronde, vous verrez un grand bâtiment sur votre droite... Je pense. Eh bien, c'est l'atelier de Cardians de la Manasterie, vous savez ?${prompt}
To find the entrances to the building, you may have to walk around the place a bit. But it's not enough to get you lost or anything...well, at least that's what I think.${prompt};Pour trouver les entrées du bâtiment, vous devrez peut-être vous promener un peu. Mais ce n'est pas assez pour vous perdre ou quelque chose comme ça... enfin, c'est ce que je pense.${prompt}
I'm sure the Minister of the Manustery will fill you in on the details of your mission.${prompt};Je suis sûr que le ministre de la Manasterie vous donnera les détails de votre mission.${prompt}
Cardians come in useful when you're after quantity over quality. Anyway, carry out your mission well--at least it'll help us keep the peace with our neighborhood ministry!${prompt};Les Cardians sont utiles lorsque vous recherchez la quantité plutôt que la qualité. Quoi qu'il en soit, menez bien votre mission--au moins cela nous aidera-t-il à maintenir la paix avec notre ministère voisin !${prompt}
Hello-ello! And you are...;Bonjour ! Et vous êtes...
Oh, the volunteer to help us out with my Manustery's little mission, rightaru?${prompt};Oh, le volontaire pour nous aider avec la petite mission de ma Manasterie, c'est bien ça ?${prompt}
Very nice of you to have come.;Très gentil de votre part d'être venu.
My name is Apururu. I'm the Minister of the Manustery, and head of this Cardian workshop.${prompt};Je m'appelle Apururu. Je suis la ministre de la Manasterie, et responsable de cet atelier de Cardians.${prompt}
But first, I should give you a rundown of what the Manustery is all about, I s'pose.${prompt};Mais d'abord, je devrais vous donner un aperçu de ce qu'est la Manasterie, je suppose.${prompt}
The Manustery is the ministry in charge of the production of automaton guards, otherwise known as Cardians. As far as military might goes, our Cardians are second only to the Orastery's War Warlocks.${prompt};La Manasterie est le ministère chargé de la production de gardes automates, également appelés Cardians. En ce qui concerne la puissance militaire, nos Cardians sont les seconds seulement aux Warlocks de guerre de l'Orasterie.${prompt}
Have you ever tried speaking to those doll-like beings that answer back in the words of the stars? Well, they are our Cardians!${prompt};Avez-vous déjà essayé de parler à ces êtres semblables à des poupées qui répondent avec les mots des étoiles ? Eh bien, ce sont nos Cardians !${prompt}
We cast a special kind of magic on a doll made of straw, cloth, and other stuff--that's what gives life to a Cardian.${prompt};Nous lançons un type spécial de magie sur une poupée faite de paille, de tissu et d'autres matériaux--c'est ce qui donne vie à un Cardian.${prompt}
We ask traveling merchants or adventurers to provide us with most of the materials we need to make Cardians. But there is one essential material we can't just ask anyone to provide us with...${prompt};Nous demandons aux marchands ambulants ou aux aventuriers de nous fournir la plupart des matériaux dont nous avons besoin pour fabriquer des Cardians. Mais il y a un matériau essentiel que nous ne pouvons pas demander à n'importe qui de nous fournir...${prompt}
That's the heart of the Cardian--a Mana Orb. Without a fully-charged Mana Orb, we cannot cast our special magic on the Cardian to keep them animated.${prompt};C'est le cœur du Cardian--une Orbe de Mana. Sans une Orbe de Mana entièrement chargée, nous ne pouvons pas lancer notre magie spéciale sur le Cardian pour les garder animés.${prompt}
That's why we leave the job of energizing Mana Orbs with magic to adventurers from Windurst only. These spheres are very important, so they cannot be entrusted to people-weople from other lands.${prompt};C'est pourquoi nous confions la tâche d'énergiser les Orbes de Mana avec de la magie aux aventuriers de Windurst seulement. Ces sphères sont très importantes, donc elles ne peuvent pas être confiées à des gens d'autres pays.${prompt}
Here...take these six dark Mana Orbs that have lost their glow.${prompt};Tenez... prenez ces six Orbes de Mana sombres qui ont perdu leur lueur.${prompt}
You are to go to the southeastern magic tower of the Horutoto Ruins in East Sarutabaruta.${prompt};Vous devez vous rendre à la tour de magie du sud-est des Ruines de Horutoto dans l'Est de Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
That's the only magic tower that's still functioning well enough to energize Mana Orbs.${prompt};C'est la seule tour de magie qui fonctionne encore assez bien pour énergiser les Orbes de Mana.${prompt}
Ask Pore-Ohre at the Horutoto Ruins to find out how to energize Mana Orbs properly-woperly.${prompt};Demandez à Pore-Ohre aux Ruines de Horutoto comment énergiser correctement les Orbes de Mana.${prompt}
You could find it to be quite a troublesome task, so if you are not quite sure of yourself, ask some of your fellow adventurers for help. Well, good luck and ta-taru!${prompt};Vous pourriez trouver cette tâche assez difficile, donc si vous n'êtes pas tout à fait sûr de vous, demandez de l'aide à quelques-uns de vos compagnons aventuriers. Eh bien, bonne chance et ta-taru !${prompt}
Lately a lot of monsters have started to roam about under the southeastern magic tower, so make sure you're prepared for adventure.${prompt};Dernièrement, beaucoup de monstres ont commencé à errer sous la tour de magie du sud-est, alors assurez-vous d'être prêt pour l'aventure.${prompt}
Once you have filled all of the Mana Orbs with magical energy, please bring them back here to me.${prompt};Une fois que vous avez rempli toutes les Orbes de Mana avec de l'énergie magique, veuillez les ramener ici.${prompt}
Oh, and unless you have all six of the dark Mana Orbs placed in their respective receptacles, the magical energy of the tower won't flow through them at all. Make sure you have all six in position before you flick the switch on the big magical gizmo at the back of the tower's base.${prompt};Oh, et à moins d'avoir toutes les six Orbes de Mana sombres placées dans leurs réceptacles respectifs, l'énergie magique de la tour ne circulera pas du tout à travers elles. Assurez-vous d'avoir toutes les six en position avant d'actionner l'interrupteur sur le grand appareil magique à l'arrière de la base de la tour.${prompt}
Well, take care, now.;Eh bien, prenez soin de vous.
Try not to get into too much trouble.${prompt};Essayez de ne pas vous attirer trop d'ennuis.${prompt}
Ask Pore-Ohre in the southeastern magic tower of the Horutoto Ruins to find out how to energize Mana Orbs properly.${prompt};Demandez à Pore-Ohre dans la tour de magie du sud-est des Ruines de Horutoto comment énergiser correctement les Orbes de Mana.${prompt}
Once you have filled all of the Mana Orbs with magical energy, please bring them back here to me. I'll be waiting for you.${prompt};Une fois que vous avez rempli toutes les Orbes de Mana avec de l'énergie magique, veuillez les ramener ici. Je vous attends.${prompt}
Almost all of the Horutoto Ruins were blown to pieces twenty years ago due to the enormous magic of the heroic “Mastermind of the Millennium.”${prompt};Presque toutes les Ruines de Horutoto ont été soufflées en morceaux il y a vingt ans en raison de l'énorme magie du héroïque “Maître du Millénaire”.${prompt}
The only magic tower left barely functioning, the southeastern one, is totally unstable-wable in the amount of energy it produces.${prompt};La seule tour de magie qui reste à peine fonctionnelle, celle du sud-est, est totalement instable dans la quantité d'énergie qu'elle produit.${prompt}
So it's nigh on impossible to create quality Mana Orbs, which leaves us weakened dramatically.${prompt};Il est donc presque impossible de créer des Orbes de Mana de qualité, ce qui nous affaiblit considérablement.${prompt}
Mana Orbs are the hearts of Cardians, you know? If a Cardian were to lose its Mana Orb, it would return to being just an inanimate straw dolly-wolly.${prompt};Les Orbes de Mana sont les cœurs des Cardians, vous savez ? Si un Cardian venait à perdre son Orbe de Mana, il redeviendrait juste une poupée de paille inanimée.${prompt}
And, if the magical energy in the Mana Orb ever runs out, even if you were to re-energize it with the gizmos in the magic towers, they still forget everything that they remembered up to then.${prompt};Et, si l'énergie magique dans l'Orbe de Mana venait à s'épuiser, même si vous deviez la ré-énergiser avec les gadgets dans les tours de magie, ils oublieraient tout ce qu'ils avaient mémorisé jusqu'à présent.${prompt}
Either way, this is what's considered as “death” for Cardians.${prompt};De toute façon, c'est ce qui est considéré comme “la mort” pour les Cardians.${prompt}
The reason that the life span of Cardians has become shortenedy is that the quality of the Mana Orbs has worsenedy.${prompt};La raison pour laquelle la durée de vie des Cardians s'est raccourcie est que la qualité des Orbes de Mana s'est détériorée.${prompt}
Just when the monsters are growing strongery and we need more Cardians than ever before, too... I'd hate to think what lies aheady if things go on like this...${prompt};Juste au moment où les monstres deviennent plus forts et où nous avons besoin de plus de Cardians que jamais auparavant, aussi... J'aurais horreur de penser à ce qui nous attend si les choses continuent ainsi...${prompt}
What?;Quoi ?
Some feral Cardians turned up againy-wainy?${prompt};Des Cardians sauvages sont réapparus ?${prompt}
It's quite an embarrassing tale for us at the Manustery, but some of the old Cardians from the war years escaped and went wild...${prompt};C'est une histoire assez gênante pour nous à la Manustery, mais certains des anciens Cardians de l'époque de la guerre se sont échappés et sont devenus sauvages...${prompt}
Those old Cardians carry out such wickedness as stealing Mana Orbs and attacking people.${prompt};Ces anciens Cardians commettent des méfaits tels que le vol d'Orbes de Mana et l'attaque de personnes.${prompt}
Mana Orbs are their hearts, remember? So the reason they steal the Mana Orbs is to revive their friends who have run out of magic in their Mana Orbs.${prompt};Les Orbes de Mana sont leur cœur, vous vous en souvenez ? Donc la raison pour laquelle ils volent les Orbes de Mana est de ressusciter leurs amis qui ont épuisé leur magie dans leurs Orbes de Mana.${prompt}
But Mana Orbs are just spheres of magic. Unless there is a mage who can use the Mana Orb and breathe life into the Cardians, they are totally useless.${prompt};Mais les Orbes de Mana ne sont que des sphères de magie. À moins qu'il n'y ait un mage capable d'utiliser l'Orbe de Mana et de donner vie aux Cardians, ils sont totalement inutiles.${prompt}
So even if they are successful in stealing the Mana Orbs, it serves them no purpose...${prompt};Donc même s'ils réussissent à voler les Orbes de Mana, cela ne leur sert à rien...${prompt}
But I'm glad that you and poor Pore-Ohre are safe. That's the most important thing.${prompt};Mais je suis heureux que vous et le pauvre Pore-Ohre soyez en sécurité. C'est le plus important.${prompt}
Well, anyway, thank you for all your trouble and hard efforts. Until next time, then, ta-taru...!${prompt};Eh bien, quoi qu'il en soit, merci pour tous vos efforts et votre travail acharné. À la prochaine fois, alors, ta-taru...!${prompt}
I hear that the Cardians who have escaped from our care have been gathering underground in the Horutoto Ruins and plotting bad deeds.${prompt};J'entends dire que les Cardians qui se sont échappés de notre surveillance se rassemblent sous terre dans les Ruines de Horutoto et complotent de mauvaises actions.${prompt}
If we leave them aloney-woney, the magic energy in their Mana Orb hearts will run out, and they will return to being nothing more than straw dolls.${prompt};Si nous les laissons tranquilles, l'énergie magique dans leurs cœurs d'Orbes de Mana s'épuisera, et ils redeviendront rien de plus que des poupées de paille.${prompt}
But someday I'll have to do something about the problem... Someday...${prompt};Mais un jour, je devrai faire quelque chose à propos du problème... Un jour...${prompt}
Thank you very muchy-wuchy!♪;Merci beaucoup !♪
Looks like you have re-energized all of our Mana Orbs. What a great help you were!♪${prompt};On dirait que vous avez ré-énergisé toutes nos Orbes de Mana. Quelle grande aide vous avez été !♪${prompt}
But I'm glad nothing disastrously bad happened... Lately some of the people who have volunteered for this mission have been attacked by feral Cardians at the exit of the Horutoto Ruins!${prompt};Mais je suis content qu'il ne se soit rien passé de désastreusement mauvais... Récemment, certains des volontaires pour cette mission ont été attaqués par des Cardians sauvages à la sortie des Ruines de Horutoto !${prompt}
When you go about breathing life into the inanimate, who knows what will happen? We're just asking for trouble.${prompt};Quand on donne vie à l'inanimé, qui sait ce qui peut arriver ? On demande juste des ennuis.${prompt}
But that's just a risk we Manustery employees have to take! It's just that...I wish they paid us a little more as hazard pay.${prompt};Mais c'est juste un risque que nous, employés de la Manusterie, devons prendre ! C'est juste que... J'aimerais bien qu'ils nous paient un peu plus pour les risques.${prompt}
The previous minister was a terrible man. When the war ended, he started throwing away our Cardians left, right and center.${prompt};L'ancien ministre était un homme terrible. Quand la guerre a pris fin, il a commencé à jeter nos Cardians à droite et à gauche.${prompt}
Of course the Cardians are going to run away. And of course they are going to come back and kidnap the previous minister. He should have seen it coming!${prompt};Bien sûr que les Cardians allaient s'enfuir. Et bien sûr qu'ils allaient revenir et enlever l'ancien ministre. Il aurait dû le voir venir !${prompt}
It's said that underneath the southwesterny tower of the Horutoto Ruins is the graveyardy where the souls of the thrown away Cardians lingery.${prompt};On dit que sous la tour sud-ouest des Ruines de Horutoto se trouve le cimetière où errent les âmes des Cardians jetés.${prompt}
Minister Apururu once saidy that saving the souls of such automatonys is the responsibility of the Manustery.${prompt};Le ministre Apururu a déjà dit que sauver les âmes de ces automates est la responsabilité de la Manusterie.${prompt}
So, have these missions helped in making you stronger? Perhaps you're about rrready for a mission that involves the Yagudo beastmen.${prompt};Alors, est-ce que ces missions vous ont aidé à devenir plus fort ? Peut-être êtes-vous prêt pour une mission qui implique les Yagudo beastmen.${prompt}
On the other side of West Sarutabaruta is a place called Giddeus--the home of the Yagudo.${prompt};De l'autre côté de l'Ouest de Sarutabaruta se trouve un endroit appelé Giddeus--le foyer des Yagudo.${prompt}
You know the Yagudo, don't you? They are the beastmen who for ever so long have rrravaged the grasslands of Sarutabaruta.${prompt};Vous connaissez les Yagudo, n'est-ce pas ? Ce sont les beastmen qui ont ravagé les prairies de Sarutabaruta depuis si longtemps.${prompt}
But the current Star Sibyl took it upon herself to try and make amicable rrrelations with the damned enemy...${prompt};Mais l'actuelle Star Sibyl s'est donné pour mission de tenter de créer des relations amicales avec l'ennemi maudit...${prompt}
As a rrresult, we have to pay tribute to the Yagudo with food offerings as a sign of our friendship. That's the crux of this mission.${prompt};En conséquence, nous devons rendre hommage aux Yagudo avec des offrandes de nourriture en signe d'amitié. C'est là tout le cœur de cette mission.${prompt}
First, you are to go to the Rrrhinostery's biological laboratory in Windurst Waters. The rrresearchers there will provide you with today's food offering for the Yagudo.${prompt};Tout d'abord, vous devez vous rendre au laboratoire biologique de la Rrrhinosterie aux Eaux de Windurst. Les chercheurs là-bas vous fourniront l'offrande alimentaire d'aujourd'hui pour les Yagudo.${prompt}
The rrresearchers will tell you what you are to do next.${prompt};Les chercheurs vous diront ce que vous devez faire ensuite.${prompt}
This is an important mission issued by Heavens Tower, or more specifically, the Star Sibyl herself. Control your hatred of the beastmen and fulfill this mission as best as you can!${prompt};Cette mission est importante et a été émise par la Tour des Cieux, ou plus précisément, la Star Sibyl elle-même. Contrôlez votre haine envers les hommes bêtes et remplissez cette mission du mieux que vous pouvez !${prompt}
Grrr... Dammit!;Grrr... Mince alors !
How long do we have to go on paying tribute to scavengers who could double-cross us at any time?${prompt};Combien de temps devons-nous continuer à rendre hommage à des charognards qui pourraient nous trahir à tout moment ?${prompt}
Anyway, you had better head on over to the Rrrhinostery in Windurst Waters, and pick up the food offering that the rrresearchers there have prepared for you to offer at Giddeus.${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit, vous feriez mieux de vous rendre à la Rrrhinostery dans les eaux de Windurst, et de récupérer l'offrande alimentaire que les chercheurs là-bas ont préparée pour vous offrir à Giddeus.${prompt}
I, I understand totally-wotally what the Star Sibyl is saying...${prompt};Je, je comprends parfaitement ce que dit la Star Sibylle...${prompt}
The Star Sibyl is thinking first and foremost of the safety of us Windurstians.${prompt};La Star Sibylle pense avant tout à la sécurité de nous, les Windurstiens.${prompt}
I just don't underrrstand why the Tarutaru fear those Yagudo.${prompt};Je ne comprends juste pas pourquoi les Tarutaru craignent ces Yagudo.${prompt}
Like, wasn't it because of that old Shadow Lorrrd that they nearly lost the war twenty years ago?${prompt};Comme, n'était-ce pas à cause de ce vieux Seigneur des Ombres qu'ils ont presque perdu la guerre il y a vingt ans ?${prompt}
With him dead and burrried, even if we were to have an all-out war with the Yagudo, we'd still come out on top...I think.${prompt};Avec lui mort et enterré, même si nous devions avoir une guerre totale avec les Yagudo, nous sortirions quand même gagnants... je pense.${prompt}
It's not like we're mindlessly opposed to a frrriendship pact with the Yagudo.${prompt};Ce n'est pas comme si nous étions opposés de manière irréfléchie à un pacte d'amitié avec les Yagudo.${prompt}
Those Yagudo don't keep their side of the barrrgain. We have the old saying of “never share a meal with those who do not keep their prrromises.”${prompt};"Ces Yagudo ne tiennent pas leur part du marché. Nous avons le vieux dicton : ""ne partage jamais un repas avec ceux qui ne tiennent pas leurs promesses.""${prompt}"
So you completed the mission...?;Donc vous avez accompli la mission... ?
Then I shall be rrrecommending you for promotion to rrrank two.${prompt};Alors je vous recommanderai pour une promotion au rang deux.${prompt}
I suggest you try your hand at conquests now, as you'll need to gain more rrrank points before we can issue you further missions.${prompt};Je vous suggère d'essayer votre chance dans les conquêtes maintenant, car vous aurez besoin de gagner plus de points de rang avant que nous puissions vous confier d'autres missions.${prompt}
You can gain the rrrank points you need from participating in the rrregional conquests. Ask the War Warlock guard in charge of conquests over there for further information...${prompt};Vous pouvez obtenir les points de rang dont vous avez besoin en participant aux conquêtes régionales. Demandez au garde War Warlock responsable des conquêtes là-bas pour plus d'informations...${prompt}
See you around.${prompt};À la prochaine.${prompt}
Grrr... You went ahead and fulfilled that mission, huh? That means we gave the lazy Yagudo nourrrishment to make them stronger...I think.${prompt};Grrr... Vous avez accompli cette mission, hein ? Cela signifie que nous avons donné aux Yagudo paresseux de la nourriture pour les rendre plus forts... je pense.${prompt}
Captain Rakoh Buuma also disagrrrees with the Star Sibyl on this, y'know? We should just rrrefuse to hand out this mission from now on...I think.${prompt};Le capitaine Rakoh Buuma est également en désaccord avec la Star Sibylle à ce sujet, vous savez ? Nous devrions simplement refuser de donner cette mission à partir de maintenant... je pense.${prompt}
W-well done!;B-bien joué !
I knew you could do it. I, I hope you didn't get hurty-wurty.${prompt};Je savais que vous en étiez capable. J'espère que vous ne vous êtes pas fait mal.${prompt}
If only those Yagudo would let down their guardy-wuardy a bit, we wouldn't have to go through all that just to give them their offerings.${prompt};Si seulement ces Yagudo baissaient un peu leur garde, nous n'aurions pas à passer par tout ça juste pour leur donner leurs offrandes.${prompt}
Even though you got promoted to rank two, you're still an underrrling. But don't be disappointed...${prompt};Même si vous avez été promu au rang deux, vous êtes toujours un débutant. Mais ne soyez pas déçu...${prompt}
Underlings can get out of work without otherrr people complaining much. And you can also secretly eat some snacks too, if you're carrreful.${prompt};Les débutants peuvent esquiver le travail sans que les autres ne se plaignent beaucoup. Et vous pouvez aussi manger quelques snacks en secret, si vous êtes prudent.${prompt}
Have you ever been to the Optistery's Library of Magic in Windurst Waters?${prompt};Avez-vous déjà été à la Bibliothèque de Magie de l'Optisterie dans les eaux de Windurst ?${prompt}
Looks like they're in a spot of trouble there, as they are urgently asking for any able adventurer we have on hand to go help them out.${prompt};Il semble qu'ils soient dans une mauvaise passe là-bas, car ils demandent de toute urgence à tout aventurier capable que nous avons sous la main de venir les aider.${prompt}
How about it, then?;Qu'en pensez-vous, alors ?
If you feel you're up to it, why don't you volunteer to help the Optistery out?${prompt};Si vous vous sentez prêt, pourquoi ne pas vous porter volontaire pour aider l'Optistery ?${prompt}
Accept Mission?;Accepter la mission ?
${selection-lines};${selection-lines}
Accept.;Accepter.
Decline.${prompt};Refuser.${prompt}
Then proceed to the Optistery's Library of Magic immediately. It's on the north side of Windurst Waters--the building that the rrroad to the north gatehouse rrruns through.${prompt};Ensuite, rendez-vous immédiatement à la Bibliothèque de Magie de l'Optistery. C'est du côté nord des eaux de Windurst, le bâtiment par lequel passe la route vers la guérite nord.${prompt}
The Library of Magic is northwest of here in Windurst Waters--the area furthest away from Windurst Woods.${prompt};La Bibliothèque de Magie est au nord-ouest d'ici dans les eaux de Windurst, la zone la plus éloignée des Bois de Windurst.${prompt}
The library lends out books if you're interested in them... Not that I've ever been there myself.${prompt};La bibliothèque prête des livres si vous êtes intéressé... Pas que j'y sois jamais allé moi-même.${prompt}
I hear they have a problem with people taking out books and never rrreturning them. Grrr... Those Tarutaru are such easy game!${prompt};J'ai entendu dire qu'ils avaient un problème avec les gens qui empruntent des livres et ne les rendent jamais. Grrr... Ces Tarutaru sont une proie facile !${prompt}
Th-the Library of Magic isn't magic in name only. Almost all the books there have some sort of enchantment-bechantment cast upon them.${prompt};La Bibliothèque de Magie n'est pas magique que de nom. Presque tous les livres là-bas ont quelque sorte d'enchantement.${prompt}
W-when you check a book out, the librarians temporarily remove the magic for safety's sake. But, but, sometimes they've been known to forget, so be careful!${prompt};Quand vous empruntez un livre, les bibliothécaires retirent temporairement la magie par mesure de sécurité. Mais parfois, ils oublient, alors faites attention !${prompt}
I've borrowed books from the Librarrry of Magic too, you know.${prompt};J'ai aussi emprunté des livres à la Bibliothèque de Magie, vous savez.${prompt}
One time I took a book home to read, and as soon as I opened it a whole army of frrrogs came jumping out at me!${prompt};Une fois, j'ai emporté un livre chez moi pour le lire, et dès que je l'ai ouvert, une armée de grenouilles en est sortie en sautant !${prompt}
I borrowed as many books as I could following that, but never had a single frog pop out at me. Too bad, as they were really tasty frrrogs, too!${prompt};J'ai emprunté autant de livres que possible par la suite, mais aucune grenouille ne m'est jamais sortie. Dommage, car elles étaient vraiment savoureuses !${prompt}
You'rrre going to the library, huh? That reminds me...I have a book overdue there...I think.${prompt};Vous allez à la bibliothèque, hein ? Ça me retourle... J'ai un livre en retard là-bas... je crois.${prompt}
What? You want to know what book I borrrrowed? Well, I'm not telling, so there!${prompt};Quoi ? Vous voulez savoir quel livre j'ai emprunté ? Eh bien, je ne le dirai pas, na !${prompt}
(Don't ask me what book I took out. It's not like I actually read them... They'rrre way over my reading age.)${prompt};(Ne me demandez pas quel livre j'ai emprunté. Ce n'est pas comme si je les lisais vraiment... Ils sont bien au-dessus de mon âge de lecture.)${prompt}
You want to know if I have a “restrrricted book” in my possession, do you?${prompt};"Vous voulez savoir si j'ai un ""livre restreint"" en ma possession, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}"
Where in Vana'diel did you hearrr that? You can never be too carrreful, you know.${prompt};Où dans Vana'diel avez-vous entendu ça ? On ne peut jamais être trop prudent, vous savez.${prompt}
Okay, I'll let you in on it.;D'accord, je vais vous le dire.
You're a second rank adventurer, arrren't you? Then allow me to ask you this little favor I have firrrst...${prompt};Vous êtes un aventurier de deuxième rang, n'est-ce pas ? Alors permettez-moi de vous demander ce petit service que j'ai d'abord...${prompt}
If you scratch my back, I'll scrrratch yours...so to speak. Do what I ask and I'll let you check the book I found. How about it, then?${prompt};Si vous me rendez service, je ferai de même... pour ainsi dire. Faites ce que je demande et je vous laisserai consulter le livre que j'ai trouvé. Qu'en dites-vous ?${prompt}
Hear her favor?;Écouter sa faveur ?
${selection-lines};${selection-lines}
Listen.;Écouter.
Refuse.${prompt};Refuser.${prompt}
If that's how it is, then farrrewell, sucker.${prompt};Si c'est comme ça, alors adieu, pigeon.${prompt}
Did you know that up in the Tahrongi Canyon, there is a serrries of caves known as the Maze of Shakhrami?${prompt};Saviez-vous qu'il y a dans le canyon de Tahrongi une série de grottes connues sous le nom de Labyrinthe de Shakhrami ?${prompt}
Happy hunting!${prompt};Bonne chasse !${prompt}
In the Tahrongi Canyon, there is a serrries of caves called the Maze of Shakhrami.${prompt};Dans le canyon de Tahrongi, il y a une série de grottes appelées le Labyrinthe de Shakhrami.${prompt}
No coral, no deal!${prompt};Pas de corail, pas d'affaire !${prompt}
You also want that book we found, don't you? Then you'll be needing something to trade the top cat with!${prompt};Vous voulez aussi ce livre que nous avons trouvé, n'est-ce pas ? Alors vous aurez besoin de quelque chose à échanger avec le gros bonnet !${prompt}
Heh-heh-heh...;Heh-heh-heh...
We don't deal in cold, hard gil, you know? We much preferrr small and pretty valuables...${prompt};Nous ne traitons pas en gils froids et durs, vous savez ? Nous préférons de petites et jolies valeurs...${prompt}
Hah! If you want the book we found, then you'rrre in for some major wheeling and dealing with the top cat, arrren't you, now?${prompt};Hah ! Si vous voulez le livre que nous avons trouvé, alors vous êtes en plein dans une grosse affaire avec le gros bonnet, n'est-ce pas, maintenant ?${prompt}
Why's that, you say?;Pourquoi cela, demandez-vous ?
Well, even that greedy, rich merrrchant from Windurst Waters is... Oops!${prompt};Eh bien, même ce marchand riche et avare des eaux de Windurst... Oups !${prompt}
Ignore what I just said.;Ignorez ce que je viens de dire.
I'll make lute strings out of your guts if you tell anyone what I just let slip!${prompt};Je ferai des cordes de luth avec vos tripes si vous dites à quelqu'un ce que je viens de laisser échapper !${prompt}
So, you came thrrrough with it?;Alors, vous avez réussi ?
Here, I'll give you this key. We'll make the trrransaction at my hideout, deep in the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt};Tenez, je vous donnerai cette clé. Nous ferons la transaction dans ma cachette, au fond des Ruines d'Horutoto.${prompt}
You go on ahead.;Vous pouvez y aller.
I'll catch up with you therrre once I've finished up herrre!${prompt};Je vous rejoindrai là-bas une fois que j'aurai terminé ici !${prompt}
We'll carry out our little trrransaction at my hideout, deep in the Horutoto Ruins.${prompt};Nous effectuerons notre petite transaction dans ma cachette, au fond des Ruines d'Horutoto.${prompt}
You go ahead.;Vous y allez.
I'll catch up with you therrre!${prompt};Je vous rejoindrai là-bas !${prompt}
I'm surprrrised you were able to find what we wanted. Now I can harrrdly wait to join the top cat in making the deal with you. Heh-heh-heh...${prompt};Je suis surpris que vous ayez pu trouver ce que nous voulions. Maintenant, je suis impatient de me joindre au gros bonnet pour conclure l'affaire avec vous. Heh-heh-heh...${prompt}
You should alrrready know this, but don't you dare tell anyone about the little deal we'll be making. You'll have a cat in hell's chance of living if you spill the beans on us.${prompt};Vous devriez déjà le savoir, mais ne vous avisez pas de dire à qui que ce soit ce petit marché que nous allons conclure. Vous n'aurez aucune chance de survivre si vous crachez le morceau sur nous.${prompt}
I can't stand the sight of you. Get out of herrre, and don't show yourrr face to me any time soon.${prompt};Je ne supporte pas votre vue. Sortez d'ici et ne me montrez pas votre visage de sitôt.${prompt}
Some Carrrdians were carrying several larrrge boxes out of the Priming Gate in Windurst Walls.${prompt};Certains Cardians transportaient plusieurs grosses boîtes hors de la Porte Principale dans les murs de Windurst.${prompt}
It was fun pulling a swift one on them, but it wasn't worrrth the trouble. Don't you darrre say crime doesn't pay!${prompt};C'était amusant de leur jouer un mauvais tour, mais ça ne valait pas la peine. Ne dites pas que le crime ne paie pas !${prompt}
I meowed her once, I meowed her a thousand times. We should stop putting our paws on anything that smells of Carrrdians.${prompt};Je lui ai miaulé une fois, je lui ai miaulé mille fois. Nous devrions arrêter de mettre nos pattes sur tout ce qui sent les Cardians.${prompt}
I neverrr want to go through that sorrrt of thing again!${prompt};Je ne veux plus jamais vivre ça !${prompt}
You came at just the rrright time.;Vous êtes arrivé au bon moment.
We just rrreceived a rrrequest for help in a large-scale mission from Heavens Tower, but we're short of adventurers to dispatch just now.${prompt};Nous venons de recevoir une demande d'aide pour une mission de grande envergure de la part de Heavens Tower, mais nous manquons d'aventuriers à envoyer pour le moment.${prompt}
The secretary of Heavens Tower will explain what this mission entails. Proceed there immediately.${prompt};La secrétaire de la Tour des Cieux vous expliquera en quoi consiste cette mission. Rendez-vous immédiatement là-bas.${prompt}
Heavens Tower is north of here in Windurst Walls. You should have the details explained to you by the secretary there.${prompt};La Tour des Cieux est au nord d'ici, dans les murs de Windurst. La secrétaire là-bas devrait vous expliquer les détails.${prompt}
Gee... I, I wish I could join in this mission-wission too!${prompt};Gee... J'aurais aimé pouvoir participer à cette mission moi aussi !${prompt}
B-but I'm too scared to ask Sola Jaab, in, in case she literally b-bites my heady-weady off!${prompt};M-mais j'ai trop peur de demander à Sola Jaab, au, au cas où elle me croquerait littéralement la têtey-wettey !${prompt}
Once you accept this mission, you won't be coming back here any time soon, y'know.;Une fois que vous acceptez cette mission, vous ne reviendrez pas ici de sitôt, vous savez.
And just when I was almost getting to like you...I think.${prompt};Et juste quand je commençais presque à vous apprécier... je crois.${prompt}
Once you go to another countrrry, you'll realize just how good old Windurst is.${prompt};Une fois que vous irez dans un autre pays, vous réaliserez à quel point l'ancienne Windurst est agréable.${prompt}
The food is great, you can cat nap as much as you like, and turning up late is the norrrm. Everyone takes life easy herrre.${prompt};La nourriture est excellente, vous pouvez faire des siestes à volonté, et arriver en retard est la norme. Tout le monde prend la vie facilement ici.${prompt}
Ah, ${name-player}!;Ah, ${name-player} !
Heavens Tower is hailing you!${prompt};Tour des Cieux vous hèle !${prompt}
Why, the head Sibyl Guard herself, Semih Lafihna, came asking for you! Seems your activities in all three nations have become your ticket to move up in the world, eh?${prompt};Eh bien, la garde Sibylle en chef elle-même, Semih Lafihna, est venue vous demander ! Il semble que vos activités dans les trois nations vous ont permis de monter en grade, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Anyway, you should hurry on over to Heavens Tower. She's as strict on herself as she is on others!${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit, vous devriez vous dépêcher d'aller à la Tour des Cieux. Elle est aussi stricte envers elle-même qu'envers les autres !${prompt}
Semih Lafihna, eh?;Semih Lafihna, hein ?
I don't know why, but I'm just not fond of that girl.${prompt};Je ne sais pas pourquoi, mais je n'aime pas cette fille.${prompt}
Anyway, get a move on to Heavens Tower. She's strict on herself and on others!${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit, dépêchez-vous d'aller à la Tour des Cieux. Elle est stricte envers elle-même et envers les autres !${prompt}
Oh, so look who gets to meet Semih Lafihna...${prompt};Oh, alors voilà qui va rencontrer Semih Lafihna...${prompt}
Everyone always arrrgues over who's the better archer, Captain Rakoh Buuma or Semih Lafihna, y'know. But Captain Buuma is the best, of courrrse...well, at least that's what I think.${prompt};Tout le monde se dispute toujours pour savoir qui est le meilleur archer, le capitaine Rakoh Buuma ou Semih Lafihna, vous savez. Mais le capitaine Buuma est le meilleur, bien sûr... enfin, c'est ce que je pense.${prompt}
Sibyl Guards aren't loved by the Mithra as a whole verrry much. We don't like people who take on fancy titles and think they're betterrr than the rest of the tribe.${prompt};Les gardes Sibylles ne sont pas très aimées par la plupart des Mithra. Nous n'aimons pas les gens qui prennent des titres pompeux et qui pensent être meilleurs que le reste de la tribu.${prompt}
What's more, that Semih Lafihna is so serrrious and hard worrrking, her tail is so slim and shiny, and she's also such a know-it-all. Doesn't she just make you jealous?${prompt};De plus, cette Semih Lafihna est tellement sérieuse et travailleuse, sa queue est si mince et brillante, et elle sait tout sur tout. Ça ne vous rend pas juste jaloux ?${prompt}
S-Sibyl G-Guards are the Mithra fighter-mighters who, who serve and protect the great Star Sibyl.${prompt};L-les gardes S-Sibylles sont les combattantes mithra qui, qui servent et protègent la grande Star Sibyl.${prompt}
M-most of the M-Mithra in Windurst serve their tribal chieftainness. So you see...Sibyl Guards are special-wecial, even in the Mithran society.${prompt};L-la plupart des M-Mithra à Windurst servent leur cheffe tribale. Vous voyez... les gardes Sibylles sont spéciales-speciales, même dans la société mithra.${prompt}
This mission has been issued by the head lady-in-waiting of Heavens Tower, Zubaba.${prompt};Cette mission a été émise par la dame d'attente en chef de Tour des Cieux, Zubaba.${prompt}
Not that I know much about her myself, but Zubaba has been serving as head lady-in-waiting since the current Star Sibyl was a child...${prompt};Bien que je ne sache pas grand-chose sur elle moi-même, Zubaba sert en tant que dame d'attente en chef depuis que la Star Sibylle actuelle est enfant...${prompt}
She's not a character you dare keep waiting. I rrrecommend you hurry on over to Heavens Tower. If you fulfill a mission from the head lady-in-waiting well enough, it's bound to improve your rrreputation.${prompt};Ce n'est pas un personnage que vous osez faire attendre. Je vous recommande de vous dépêcher d'aller à la Tour des Cieux. Si vous remplissez bien une mission de la dame d'attente en chef, votre réputation est certainement améliorée.${prompt}
This mission has been issued by the head lady-in-waiting, Zubaba.${prompt};Cette mission a été émise par la dame d'attente en chef, Zubaba.${prompt}
Seems that they were impressed by your efforts in your previous mission. If you want to keep in their good books, I suggest you rrrush on over to Heavens Tower.${prompt};Il semble qu'ils aient été impressionnés par vos efforts dans votre mission précédente.

ONE'S★GREE-TING★IS...;QUOOOOOIIIII ?${prompt}
WASS★UUUUUUUUP?${prompt};Ne va pas enseigner ces mots étranges aux enfants Cardians ! C'est pratiquement impossible de faire oublier quelque chose aux Cardians une fois qu'ils l'ont mémorisé !${prompt}
Don't go teachying that kiddy strange wordies! It's practically impossible to make Cardians forgety something once they memorizey it!${prompt};Ce Cardian Nouveau-né n'est encore qu'un bébé ! Alors il mémorise tout et n'importe quoi sans réserve.${prompt}
That Spare Oney there is but a newborny Cardian! So he memorizes anythingy and everythingy without reservation.${prompt};"L'autre jour, Kopuro-Popuro est allé enseigner à l'un de nos Kindercardianers les mots ""les chapeaux sucent"" et cela a beaucoup contrarié le vieux Boizo-Naizo.${prompt}"
The other day Kopuro-Popuro went and taught one of our Kindercardianers the words “hats suck” and upset old Boizo-Naizo to no end.${prompt};Les Cardians Nouveau-nés sont comme les enfants ordinaires des gens, alors tu dois leur apprendre à utiliser les mots correctement !${prompt}
Newborn Cardians are just like ordinary people's children, so you have to teach them to use words properly-woperly!${prompt};Hé, toi là-basy !
Hey, you therey!;Tu te souviens du Cardiany à qui tu as enseigné un salut stupide l'autre jour ?${prompt}
Remember that Cardiany you taught a silly greeting to the other day?${prompt};Ce pauvre Cardiany ne voulait tout simplement pas oublier les mots que tu lui as enseignés.${prompt}
That poor Cardiany just wouldn't forgety the words you taughty it.${prompt};Puisque c'est toi qui as enseigné une salutation inappropriée à ce pauvre petit, tu devrais assumer tes actions et lui enseigner une manière correcte de saluer les autresy !${prompt}
Seeing as it was you who taughty the poor thingy an inappropriate greeting, you should take responsibility for your actions and teachy him a correct way of greeting otheries!${prompt};Si rien n'est fait, il devra vivre dans l'embarras en tant que Cardian mal formé pour le reste de ses jours. Ne serait-ce pas dommagey ?${prompt}
If somethingy's not done, he'll have to livey in embarrassment as a poorly-trained Cardian for the resty of his days. Wouldn't that be a pity-wity?${prompt};Tu trouves ça pitoyable ?
Think it's pitiable?;${selection-lines}
${selection-lines};Oui, c'est triste.
Yes, that's sad.;Pas vraiment...${prompt}
Not really...${prompt};Brute inhumainy !
You inhumane brutey!;N'as-tu aucun sentimenty ?${prompt}
Have you no feelingies?${prompt};Au fur et à mesure que les Cardians grandissent et montent en grade, leurs noms changenty. Ainsi, ce Cardian de rechange à qui tu as parlé alors a maintenant un nom différenty qui correspond au poste qu'il a rempli.${prompt}
As Cardians grow up and rise in ranky, their names changey. So, that Spare Cardian you spoke to backy then has a different namey that goes with the position he filledy.${prompt};Je crois que son nom est maintenant Cinq de quelque chose...?${prompt}
I think his namey is now Five of something-or-othery...?${prompt};Eh bien, je ne saisy pas...!?
Well, I don't knowy...!?;Leurs noms changenty tellement qu'il est pratiquement impossible de savoir qui est qui !${prompt}
Their names changey so much, it's practically impossible to keep tracky of who's who!${prompt};"De toute façon, essaye de te promenery et de parler aux Cardians de chaque groupe avec le nom ""Cinq"" et utilise le salut que tu lui as enseigné comme un signe pour le reconnaître des autres.${prompt}"
Anyway, try going aroundy and talking to the Cardians of each suit with the namey “Five,” and use the greeting you taught him as a signy to tell him apart from the otheries.${prompt};Le Cardian dont tu as ruiné la vie en lui enseignant un salut stupide devrait maintenant s'appeler Cinq de quelque chose... ?${prompt}
The Cardian whose lifey you ruined by teaching him a silly greeting should now be named Five of something-or-othery...?${prompt};"De toute façon, essaye de te promenery et de parler aux Cardians de chaque groupe avec le nom ""Cinq"" et utilise le salut que tu lui as enseigné comme un signe pour le reconnaître des autres.${prompt}"
Anyway, try going aroundy and talking to the Cardians of each suit with the namey “Five,” and use the greeting you taught him as a signy to tell him apart from the otheries.${prompt};Les Cardians de Windurst reçoivent des numéros dans l'ordre de leur naissance. Lorsque leur prédécesseur numérique tombe en panne, tous les Cardians en dessous montent en grade pour compléter les numéros d'un jeu complet.${prompt}
The Cardians of Windurst are dealt out numbers in the order that they are born. When their numerical predecessor breaks down, all the Cardians below him rise in rank to fill out the numbers of a full deck.${prompt};Ainsi, plus il y a de Cardians qui deviennent défaillants ou détruits, plus vite les numéros dans les noms de leurs successeurs changent.${prompt}
So the more Cardians that become run-down or destroyed, the faster the numbers in the names of their successors change.${prompt};Oh, tu veux dire ce Cardian... ? Donc il est déjà devenu le numéro cinq, hein ?${prompt}
Oh, you mean that Cardian...? So he's grown up to become number five already, huh?${prompt};<Soupir>...
<Sigh>...;Quand j'entends cela, je réalise à quel point la durée de vie de nos Cardians devient courte...${prompt}
When I hear that, it brings home to me just how short the lifespans of our Cardians are becoming...${prompt};Je crois que ce Cardian particulier dont tu parles a été créé par Kopuro-Popuro.${prompt}
I believe that particular Cardian you speak of was made by Kopuro-Popuro.${prompt};Kopuro-Popuro a l'habitude d'oublier les choses importantes tout en se souvenant toujours des informations les plus inutiles. Tel père, tel fils, hein ?${prompt}
Kopuro-Popuro has a habit of forgetting important things while always remembering the most useless of information. Like father, like son, eh?${prompt};Alors, l'as-tu trouvé...?
So, did you findy him...?;Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire, il est à l'extérieury de la ville ? Hein ? Il est si loin de la villey ?${prompt}
What do you meany, he's outsidey of town? Eh? He's that far away from towny?${prompt};Qu'est-ce qu'il fait dans un endroit aussi dangereuxy ? On ferait mieux de se dépêcher d'envoyer quelqu'un pour le ramenery ! Tiens...prends ça comme petit remerciement pour l'avoir retrouvéy !${prompt}
What's he doing in such a dangerous placey? We'd better hurry and send someone out to bring him backy! Here...takey this as a little thank-you for finding himy!${prompt};S'il reste hors de la villey trop longtemps, il y a un risque que les gens le confondent avec l'un de ces Cardians sauvages et le tuenty !${prompt}
If he stays outside of towny too long, there's a chance people might mistakey him for one of those feral Cardians and killy him!${prompt};Qu'est-ce qu'il fait dans un endroit aussi dangereuxy ? On ferait mieux de se dépêcher d'envoyer quelqu'un pour le ramenery !${prompt}
What's he doing in such a dangerous placey? We'd better hurry and send someone out to bring him backy!${prompt};S'il reste hors de la villey trop longtemps, il y a un risque que les gens le confondent avec l'un de ces Cardians sauvages et le tuenty !${prompt}
If he stays outside of towny too long, there's a chance people might mistakey him for one of those feral Cardians and killy him!${prompt};Qu'est-ce qu'il fait dans un endroit aussi dangereuxy ? On ferait mieux de se dépêcher d'envoyer quelqu'un pour le ramenery !${prompt}
What's he doing in such a dangerous placey? We'd better hurry and send someone out to bring him backy!${prompt};Il est vrai que les numéros par lesquels les Cardians sont appelés changent beaucoup ces derniers temps, mais nous ne devrions pas oublier les étudiants individuels derrière ces noms.${prompt}
It is true that the numbers the Cardians are called by change a lot lately, but we should not forget the individual students behind those names.${prompt};Ce lieu est différent des écoles où l'on enseigne comment étudier. C'est plus comme un foyer où nous élevons les enfants de manière aimantey.${prompt}
This facility is different from schools where they teach people how to study-wudy. This is more like a home where we raise children in a loving way.${prompt};Dis...je me demande si ce Cardian a correctement oublié la ligne “les chapeaux sucent” que je lui ai enseignée ?${prompt}
Say...I wonder whether that Cardian properly forgot the “hats suck” line I taught him?${prompt};Je ne pense pas que nous devrions forcer les Cardians à oublier des choses qu'ils ne veulent pas oublier.${prompt}
I don't think we should force Cardians to forget things they don't want to forget.${prompt};Un peu plus d'individualité ne ferait pas de mal à nos Cardians, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
It wouldn't hurt for our Cardians to have a little more individuality now, would it?${prompt};Nous sommes dans de beaux draps, tout le monde !${prompt}
We're in deep water, everyone!${prompt};Nous sommes encore dans le rouge cette semaine.${prompt}
We're in the red again this week.${prompt};Et après toutes ces réductions que nous avons mises en place récemment, aussi...${prompt}
And after all of those cutbacks we've been implementing lately, too...${prompt};Je voudrais vous demander à tous des idées... Comment pouvons-nous renflouer les caisses du Manustère ?${prompt}
I'd like to ask you all for ideas... How can we get some gil back into the Manustery's coffers?${prompt};Je sais, Ministre Apururu ! Il semble que c'est le moment de mettre en œuvre le “Plan B Légendaire” !${prompt}
I know, Minister Apururu! It looks like it's time to implement “Legendary Plan B”!${prompt};Légendaire-waire ?${prompt}
Legendary-wary?${prompt};Plan B ?${prompt}
Plan B?${prompt};Il y a longtemps, notre ancien Manustère faisait face à une crise financière tout comme nous aujourd'hui...${prompt}
Long, long ago, our old Manustery was facing a financial crisis much like we are today...${prompt};C'était à une époque bien avant que les aéronefs ne connectent les villes de Vana'diel avec le réseau pratique que nous avons maintenant.${prompt}
This was in an age long before airships connected the cities of Vana'diel with the convenient network we have now.${prompt};À cette époque-là, les voyageurs en route vers Jeuno étaient menacés par des monstres nocturne-wurnes redoutables.${prompt}
Back then, travelers on their way to Jeuno were menaced by fearsome nocturnal-wurnal monsters.${prompt};Pour éclaircir l'avenir de ces voyageurs, nos prédécesseurs, dans leur grande sagesse, ont conçu un charme pour les randonneurs appelé le “Gris-gris du Gadabout” !${prompt}
To brighten up the future for those travelers, our predecessors, in their great wisdom, devised a charm for trekkers they called the “Gadabout's Gris-gris”!${prompt};L'effet de ces charmes était stupéfiant, et la diminution du nombre d'incidents dangereux qui frappaient les voyageurs en direction de Jeuno était significative.${prompt}
The effect of these charms was astounding, and the reduction in the number of dangerous incidents that befell Jeuno-bound travelers was significant.${prompt};Hmm... Oh, vraiment ?
Hmm... Oh, really?;Eh bien, je ne sais pas si c'est vrai ou juste une vieille histoire de grand-mère, mais on pourrait faire une belle somme de gils en vendant de tels charmes aux magasins locaux, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
Well, I don't know whether it's true or just an old wives' tale, but we could make a load of gil by selling such charms to the local goods stores, couldn'taru we?${prompt};"C'était une information très utile, surtout venant de la part de quelqu'un comme Kopuro-Popuro. Alors, comment fabrique-t-on ces ""Gadabout's Gris-gris"", machin chose ?${prompt}"
That was mighty useful information, especially coming from the likes of Kopuro-Popuro. So, how does one go about making these “Gadabout's Gris-gris” thingamabobs?${prompt};Eh bien, il vous faut toutes sortes d'objets que les monstres nocturnes laissent tomber quand ils sont vaincus.${prompt}
Well, you need all kinds of items that nocturnal monsters drop when defeated.${prompt};Pour fabriquer un charme, je pense que nous avons juste besoin de : ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}
In order to make a charm, I think we just need: ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt};Je vois... Génial !
I see... Great!;Alors nous allons en fabriquer une tonne à vendre. Nous aurons de l'argent dans les coffres du Manustery en un rien de temps !${prompt}
Then we'll just make a heap of them to sell. We'll have money back in the Manustery's coffers in no time!${prompt};Vous nous aiderez aussi, n'est-ce pas ? S'il vous plaît, récupérez un de chaque objet que les monstres nocturnes laissent tomber.${prompt}
You'll help us out as well, won'taru you? Please collect one of each of the items that the nocturnal monsters drop.${prompt};Rappelez-vous, nous avons besoin de ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} pour fabriquer un charme. Bonne chance, mon p’tit !${prompt}
Remember, we need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} to make one charm. Good luck, kiddo!${prompt};Hmm...
Hmm...;C'est la première fois que j'entends parler du Plan Légendaire B.${prompt}
That's the first I've heard of the Legendary Plan B.${prompt};Je ne savais pas que notre ministère était aussi pauvre depuis si longtemps ! Je ne sais pas si je devrais m'en réjouir ou sombrer encore plus dans la dépression...${prompt}
I didn't realize our ministry has been this poor for so long! I don't know whether I should take comfort from it, or fall into even further depression...${prompt};"Alors... je me demande combien de ces machins ""Gadabout's Gris-gris"" nous devons fabriquer pour remettre notre budget à flot.${prompt}"
So...I wonder how many of these “Gadabout's Gris-gris” thingamabobs we have to make to bring our budget back into the black.${prompt};"Eh bien, les finances ne sont pas mon souci, alors je vais simplement me concentrer sur la fabrication des marchandises. Je continuerai à fabriquer des ""Gadabout's Gris-gris"" jusqu'à ce que nous tombions tous d'épuisement.${prompt}"
Well, finances aren't my concern, so I'll just concentrate on making the goods. I'll just keep making “Gadabout's Gris-gris” until we all drop from exhaustion.${prompt};Nous avons décidé de continuer avec notre Plan Légendaire B -- fabriquer et vendre des charmes spéciaux qui protègent les gens qui voyagent la nuit.${prompt}
We've decided to go aheady with our Legendary Plan B--to make and sell special charmies that protect people who travel by nighty.${prompt};Le meilleur, c'est qu'ils ne nécessitent aucune magie spéciale -- tant que nous avons les bons matériaux, ils sont faciles à fabriquer !${prompt}
The best thingy is that they don't require any special magicky--so long as we have the right materialies, they are easy to makey!${prompt};Oh, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, et ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}... On dirait que nous avons tout !${prompt}
Oh, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}, and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}... Looks likey we have everything!${prompt};Voici votre part...
Here's your cut...;Beau travail, mon p'tit !${prompt}
Good work, kid!${prompt};Nous sommes dans de sales draps, tout le monde !${prompt}
We're in deep water, everyone!${prompt};Nous avons des montagnes de stock invendu ! Cela signifie des montagnes de dettes !${prompt}
We have mountains of unsold stock! That means mountains of debt!${prompt};Dernièrement, les aventuriers ont réduit les monstres nocturnes à des niveaux contrôlables, donc voyager la nuit n'est plus aussi dangereux qu'avant. Cela signifie que nos charmes ne se vendent pas du tout !${prompt}
Lately adventurers have been culling nocturnal monsters down to controllable levels, so traveling by night isn't as dangerous as it used to be. This means our charms aren't selling at all!${prompt};J'arrête le Plan Légendaire B. Maintenant, je dois calculer combien de rouge nous sommes après cette idée saugrenue !${prompt}
I'm putting an end to Legendary Plan B. Now I've got to calculate how much more in the red we are after that harebrained scheme!${prompt};Tenez... Je vous en donne aussi un. Sortez-moi cette bêtise de ma vue !${prompt}
Here...I'll give you one, too. Just get the silly thing out of my sighty-wighty!${prompt};<Soupir>...
<Sigh>...;Je sais, je sais... pas besoin de me le dire. J'aurais dû réaliser que c'était une idée stupide plus tôt...${prompt}
I know, I know...you don't have to tell me. I should have realized this was a stupid idea earlier...${prompt};Je ne comprends pas...
I don't get it...;Qu'est-ce qui n'a pas fonctionné avec le Plan Légendaire B ?${prompt}
What went wrong with Legendary Plan B?${prompt};Je sais... Je parie que quelqu'un s'est délibérément efforcé de saboter mon plan ! Oui, c'est ça. Quelqu'un a dû employer des aventuriers pour sortir et chasser les monstres nocturnes.${prompt}
I know...I bet someone deliberately set out to interfere with my plan! Yeah, that's it. Someone must have employed adventurers to go out and hunt nocturnal monsters.${prompt};Cela montre bien que si l'on a les doigts dans plusieurs tartes, on risque de se brûler les doigts...${prompt}
It just goes to showy...if you have a fingery in more than one pie, you're going to get your fingers burnedy...${prompt};C'était une bonne leçon sur la nature des affaires. Il y a des pièges dans la diversification après tout.${prompt}
That was a good lessony in the nature of businessy. There are pitfalls in diversification after all.${prompt};Des montagnes de stock invendu !
Mountains of unsold stock!;Des montagnes de dettes !${prompt}
Mountains of debt!${prompt};Ministre Apururu !${wait-animation: 1}
Minister Apururu!${wait-animation: 1};C'est la Reine de Cœur, Miss ! Elle est revenue toute blessée et mal en point !${prompt}
It's Queen of Hearts, Miss! She's come back all wounded and hurt!${prompt};!!!${prompt}
!!!${prompt};Vous devriez rester là, mon p'tit. Je pense que la ministre est en train de faire les derniers rites pour la Reine de Cœur.${prompt}
You should stay there, kid. I think the minister is giving Queen of Hearts its last rites.${prompt};La reine a eu une vie heureuse...
Queen hAd a hap-py lifE...;Sous les cieux bleus...!${prompt}
Under tHe Blue Skies...!${prompt};Le seul regret de la reine est que la Reine de Carreau n'est pas revenue ici aussi...!${prompt}
Queen's Only Re-gret iS Queen oF Dia-monds dId not mAke iT back hEre tOo...!${prompt};Je comprends, Reine de Cœur...
I understand, Queen of Hearts...;Ne vous inquiétez pas pour la Reine de Carreau. Je m'occuperai d'elle...${prompt}
Don't you worry about Queen of Diamonds. I'll look after her...${prompt};Merci pour une longue vie de service assidu. Maintenant, vous pouvez reposer en paix, ma chère...${prompt}
Thank you for a long life of diligent service. Now you can rest in peace, my dear...${prompt};Désolée de vous avoir fait attendre, aventurier. Une vie vient de retourner aux étoiles tout à l'heure...${prompt}
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting, adventurer. A life had to return to the stars just now...${prompt};Elle est revenue ici malgré son état décrépit...${prompt}
She came back all the way here to me, despite her decrepit state...${prompt};Je suis juste heureuse d'avoir pu dire un dernier adieu...${prompt}
I'm just glad I was able to say a final farewell...${prompt};Enfin bon, aventurier...
Well, anyway, adventurer...;Vous avez sûrement beaucoup voyagé dans le monde et vu beaucoup de choses tristes vous-même.${prompt}
You surely have traveled the world by now and seen many sad things yourself.${prompt};J’ai une requête pour quelqu’un comme vous. Dites-moi si vous trouvez par hasard un Cardian nommé la Reine de Carreau. Je vous paierai ${number: 1} gil pour des informations sur son emplacement.${prompt}
I have a request for one such as you. Please tell me if you happen to find a Cardian named the Queen of Diamonds. I'll pay you ${number: 1} gil for information about her whereabouts.${prompt};Si elle est en route ici aussi, cela signifie qu’elle est sérieusement blessée. S’il vous plaît, dépêchez-vous de la trouver pour moi...${prompt}
If she's on her way here too, then that can only mean she is seriously hurt as well. Please hurry and find her for me...${prompt};Je vous paierai ${number: 1} gil pour des informations sur l’emplacement d’un Cardian appelé la Reine de Carreau.${prompt}
I'll pay you ${number: 1} gil for information on the whereabouts of a Cardian called the Queen of Diamonds.${prompt};Si elle est en route ici aussi, cela signifie qu'elle est sérieusement blessée. S'il vous plaît, dépêchez-vous de la trouver pour moi...${prompt}
If she's on her way here too, then that can only mean she is seriously hurt as well. Please hurry and find her for me...${prompt};Peu importe combien de fois vous le vivez, dire nos derniers adieux à nos petits Cardians est une chose douloureuse.${prompt}
No mattery how many times you experience it, saying our last goodbyes to our Cardian kiddies is a sorrowful thingy.${prompt};<sniff> C'est d'autant plus douloureux quand c'est un Cardian que vous avez donné vie et élevé de vos propres mains. <sob> Waaah !${prompt}
<sniff> It's all the more painfuly when it is a Cardiany you breathed life into and raised with your own handies. <sob> Waaah!${prompt};Le Cardian qui est mort tout à l'heure était celui que la ministre Apururu a élevé personnellement...${prompt}
The Cardian who died just then was one that Minister Apururu raised personally...${prompt};Ce Cardian a pu revenir ici avec sa force restante, mais je crains que la Reine de Carreau n'ait pas été aussi chanceuse...${prompt}
That Cardian was able to make it back here with her remaining strength, but I fear Queen of Diamonds was not so lucky...${prompt};Même si nous trouvons seulement une de ses parties, au moins nous pourrons lui donner une sépulture digne...${prompt}
Even if we only find one of her parts, at least we'll be able to give her a proper burial...${prompt};Quoi...?
What the...?;Elle vous offre ${number: 1} gils pour retrouver notre Cardian disparu ? C'est exactement ce genre de stupidités qui nous plonge encore plus dans le rouge !${prompt}
She's offered to pay you ${number: 1} gil to find our missing Cardian? That's just the kind of stupid thing that puts us further and further into the red!${prompt};Si ce Cardian est en route vers ici, cela signifie seulement qu'il est sur le point de passer l'arme à gauche, non ?${prompt}
If that Cardian's on its way back here, then it only means it's going to kick the bucket at any moment, rightaru?${prompt};Alors pourquoi payer un prix aussi élevé pour retrouver quelque chose d'aussi inutile ?${prompt}
So why pay such a high price to find something as drop-dead useless as thataru!?${prompt};C'est comme, pourquoi dépenser autant d'argent pour des sentiments personnels stupides, alors que mettre cet argent pour créer un nouveau Cardian est dans l'intérêt de tous ?${prompt}
It's like, why spend so much money on silly personal sentiments, when putting that gil towards creating a new Cardian is in everybody's interests?${prompt};Désolé, mais cette fois-ci je vais devoir le dire à notre ministre sans détours !${prompt}
I'm sorry, but this time I'm going to have to put it to our Minister quite bluntly-wuntly!${prompt};Même si vous ou quelqu'un d'autre retrouvez la vieille Reine de Carreau pour nous, nous ne cracherons pas un seul gil, je vous le dis ! Je suis totalement contre ce genre de bêtises !${prompt}
Even if you or anyone else finds old Queen of Diamonds for us, we won't be coughing up a single gil, I tell you! I'm totally against such tomfoolery!${prompt};D'abord, contre nature, vous fournissez de la force vitale à des vaisseaux vides. Ensuite, vous les envoyez sur les champs de bataille. Si vous pleurez quand ils crèvent, autant ne pas créer ces fichues choses dès le départ !${prompt}
First, against nature, you go provide lifeforce to empty vessels. Then you send them out into the battlefields. If you're going to cry about it when they drop dead, then you'd might as well not make the damned things to begin with!${prompt};Même si vous ou quelqu'un d'autre retrouvez la vieille Reine de Carreau pour nous, nous ne cracherons pas un seul gil, je vous le dis ! Je suis totalement contre ce genre de bêtises !${prompt}
Even if you or anyone else finds old Queen of Diamonds for us, we won't be coughing up a single gil, I tell you! I'm totally against such tomfoolery!${prompt};Je ne peux pas lire la marque, mais c'est une partie de l'un de nos enfants qui a quitté ce ministère et est mort quelque part là-bas...${prompt}
I cannot read the marking, but this is a part of one of our children who left this ministry and died somewhere out there...${prompt};Oh...?${prompt}
Oh...?${prompt};Qu'est-ce que je vois sur ce fruit d'étoile ?${prompt}
What's that I see on this starfruit?${prompt};Regardez comme il brille si magnifiquement...
Look how it glitters so beautifully...;Et cette forme...
And that shape...;Pourquoi, on dirait presque que c'est...${prompt}
Why, it almost looks as if it's...${prompt};un...${prompt}
a...${prompt};Tenez.
Here.;Veuillez montrer cela à Boizo-Naizo.${prompt}
Please show this to Boizo-Naizo.${prompt};Veuillez montrer ce fruit d'étoile à Boizo-Naizo.${prompt}
Please show that starfruit to Boizo-Naizo.${prompt};......${prompt}
......${prompt};Oh, c'est sans valeur. Une telle poubelle mérite d'être jetée dans la poubelle.${prompt}
Oh, that's worthless. Such garbage deserves to be thrown into the trashcan.${prompt};Oh, je vois que vous avez trouvé un morceau d'elle, hein ? Cette noix est en effet une partie de ce qui était autrefois la grande Reine de Carreau.${prompt}
Oh, I see you found a piece of her, huh? This nut is indeed part of what was once the great Queen of Diamonds.${prompt};Sa marque est effacée, mais je reconnais une maison de diamant quand je vois ça. Voyez-vous, c'est moi qui fabrique les Cardians de Diamants, vous savez ?${prompt}
Its marking has worn away, but I know a diamond house when I see it. See, I'm the one who makes the Diamond Cardians, you know?${prompt};Mais je n'ai pas l'intention de vous payer un seul gil ! C'est toujours une poubelle sans valeur, même si c'était l'un des miens. Je suis différent de la ministre Apururu, vous voyez. Je ne laisse pas mes sentiments interférer avec mon travail...${prompt}
But I don't intend to pay you a single gil! It's still worthless garbage, even if it was one of my own. I'm different from Minister Apururu, you see. I don't allow my feelings to get caught up in my work...${prompt};...Hein ?
...Huh?;Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça...?${prompt}
What's this here...?${prompt};Était-ce sur le fruit d'étoile quand vous l'avez trouvé ?${prompt}
Was this on the starfruit when you found it?${prompt};Cette glace... !?
This ice...!?;Pourquoi, sa forme ressemble... presque à...
Why, its shape looks...almost like...;... une larme...${prompt}
...a tear...${prompt};Ah...
Ah...;Elle fond...${prompt}
It's melting...${prompt};...
...;Eh bien, je suppose que le ministre vous l'a promis, alors... je vous paierai la récompense pour avoir trouvé cette carambole.${prompt}
Well, I guess the Minister did promise it to you, so...I'll pay you the reward for finding this starfruit.${prompt};Mais ${number: 1} gils, c’est trop demander. Désolé, mais vous devrez vous contenter de ${number: 2} gils.${prompt}
But ${number: 1} gil is asking too much. Sorry, but you'll have to make do with ${number: 2} gil.${prompt};Non, je ne suis pas devenu tout émotif, vous savez ! C’était juste une poupée à laquelle nous avons insufflé temporairement la vie, n’est-ce pas ?${prompt}
No, I've not become all emotional, mind you! It was just a doll into which we breathed temporary life, rightaru?${prompt};D'abord, contre nature, vous fournissez de la force vitale à des vaisseaux vides. Ensuite, vous les envoyez sur les champs de bataille. Si vous allez pleurer quand ils crèvent, autant ne pas créer ces fichues choses dès le départ !${prompt}
First, against nature, you provide lifeforce to empty vessels. Then you go send them out into the battlefields. If you're going to cry about it when they drop dead, then you'd might as well not make the damned things to begin with!${prompt};Boizo-Naizo a-t-il vraiment donné ${number: 2} gils tout à l’heure ?${prompt}
Did Boizo-Naizo really just dish out ${number: 2} gil just then?${prompt};Je ne sais pas d’où vient une telle somme, car notre Manustère n’a certainement pas ça à gaspiller... Ah !${prompt}
I don't know where such an amount came from, as our Manustery certainly doesn't have that to spare... Ah!${prompt};C'est vrai, il disait juste qu'il avait enfin économisé assez de gils pour acheter la dernière création de chapeau du chapelier ! Vous ne pensez pas qu'il a utilisé cet argent pour vous payer, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
That's rightaru...he was just saying that he finally saved up enough gil to buy the latest hat creation from the hatter! You don'taru suppose he used that money to pay you, do you?${prompt};Les Cardians sont des formes de vie nées en empruntant le pouvoir des étoiles. Ils sont tout comme nous, des êtres dotés d'une force vitale qui descend des cieux.${prompt}
Cardians are life forms born by borrowing the power of the stars. They are just like us--beings with a lifeforce that comes down from the heavens.${prompt};C'est pourquoi nous ne devrions jamais oublier...
So we should never forget...;La force vitale d'un Cardian n'est pas quelque chose que nous avons créé. Nous avons simplement appelé ce pouvoir sur terre.${prompt}
A Cardian's lifeforce is not something we created. We simply called that power down to the earth.${prompt};C'est pourquoi nous devrions envoyer cette vie lorsqu'elle quitte la terre, en lui disant que nous espérons nous retrouver.${prompt}

We are on the path to great wars and the spilling of much blood.

We have received worrrd from Rakoh Buuma, captain of the eastern gatehouse.${prompt};Nous avons peur que ce soit plutôt de mauvaises nouvelles. Rien de bon n'arrive les jours où le vent souffle chaud.${prompt}

Why, my child, did you cause yet anotherrr of nature's wonderrrs to die meaninglessly? It is useless to even try and explain this fang's meaning to one such as you.${prompt};Pour le chasseur, les crocs ne sont pas seulement un outil vital pour l'existence, mais aussi un témoin de sa mort. Si celui aux crocs perd ses crocs, il ne peut plus vivre. Pourtant, quand celui aux crocs meurt, seuls ses crocs restent.${prompt}

Yet when the fanged one dies, only its fangs rrremain.${prompt};Pour chasser comme celui aux crocs, tu dois vivre par le croc et mourir en ne laissant que le croc derrière toi.${prompt}
To hunt like the fanged one, you must live by the fang and die leaving only the fang behind.${prompt};À toi, notre nouveau ranger, je te confie le témoin de la vie et de la mort du grand celui aux crocs...${prompt}

Glorrry to the fangs of the fanged one. Listen to the voice of nature and follow her courrrse. The sky and earrrth shall tell you the time to fight and the time to die.${prompt};Pourquoi penses-tu que les gens ont perdu leurs crocs ? Peut-être parce que les gens ont arrêté d'écouter la voix de la nature.${prompt}
Why do you suppose people lost their fangs? Perrrhaps it was because people stopped listening to nature's voice.${prompt};Cette arme que tu tiens dans tes mains n'est qu'une manifestation temporaire d'un croc. Tes vrais crocs existent dans ton cœur !${prompt}
That weapon you hold in your hands is but a temporrrary manifestation of a fang. Your true fangs exist within your hearrrt!${prompt};Il n'y a pas de vies sans signification dans ce monde, mais il y a un grand nombre de morts sans signification.${prompt}
There are no meaningless lives in this worrrld, yet there are a great numberrr of meaningless deaths.${prompt};N'oublie jamais, celui aux crocs...
Never forrrget, fanged one...;N'oublie jamais la faute et la folie de causer une mort inutile.${prompt}
Never forrrget the sinfulness and folly of causing an unnecessary death.${prompt};Hé ! Que veux-tu ?
Hey! What do you want?;Ne me dis pas...${prompt}
Don't tell me...${prompt};Tu as entendu que j'ai un diagramme de corrélation des monstres et tu es venu me supplier de te le montrer, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}

No.${prompt};Oh, donc tu essaies juste de flirter avec moi, hein ? Désolé, mais je ne suis intéressé ni par les hommes ni par les femmes. La seule chose qui fait battre mon cœur, ce sont les traces et les déjections de ma prochaine proie de chasse, merci.${prompt}
Oh, so you're just trying to flirt with me, huh? Well, sorry there, but I'm not interrrested in men or women. The only thing that makes my heart leap are the tracks and droppings of my next hunting game, thank you.${prompt};Je le savais !
I knew it!;Très bien alors. Ça ne me dérange pas de te le montrer. Après tout, je suis un chasseur de premier ordre, donc je n'en ai pas vraiment besoin.${prompt}
Alrrright then. I don't mind showing it to you. Besides, I'm a topnotch hunter, so I don't need it anyway.${prompt};On m'a donné ce parchemin il y a quelques années par un vieil Elvaan mal dégrossi. Je l'ai aidé quand je l'ai trouvé perdu dans les bois, et c'était sa façon de me rendre la pareille.${prompt}
I was given this parchment a few years ago by a scrrruffy old Elvaan man. I helped him out when I found him lost in the woods, and this was his way of paying me back.${prompt};Pour tout te dire, je n'étais pas tellement intéressé, alors je n'ai pas fait beaucoup attention à son explication et j'ai presque tout oublié de ce qu'il a dit.${prompt}
To tell you the truth, I wasn't that interested in it, so I didn't pay much attention to his explanation and have forrrgotten most of what he said.${prompt};C'était quelque chose à propos de comment les différents types de monstres se mangent les uns les autres pour survivre, alors je suppose qu'il essayait de me dire de me référer à ce schéma quand je chasse.${prompt}
It was something about how the different types of monsters eat each other in order to surrrvive, so I guess he was trying to tell me to referrr to this pattern when I go hunting.${prompt};Mais chaque fois que je repère un monstre, je deviens complètement obsédé par la pensée de la chasse et j'oublie tout conseil et ce diagramme.${prompt}
But whenever I spot a monster, I become totally obsessed by the thought of the hunt and forrrget all about his advice and this chart.${prompt};Peut-être suffit-il de garder cette connaissance enfouie quelque part dans un coin de ton esprit, au cas où tu en aurais besoin. Mais si tu veux en savoir plus, alors il faudra juste que tu retrouves ce vieil homme.${prompt}
Maybe it's enough to just keep this knowledge locked away in the back of your mind somewhere, in case you ever need it.

You're welcome to have another gander at this chart whenever you want to. It's a pain to explain it to everyone who asks, but maybe it is some kind of fate...

Hmm... You call yourself an adventurrrer? I guess if one stretches her imagination enough, you could almost look like one.${prompt};Permettez-moi de deviner que c'est votre première fois à Windurst.${prompt}
Let me take a stab in the darrrk and guess that this is your first time in Windurst.${prompt};Première fois à Windurst ?
First time in Windurst?;${selection-lines}
${selection-lines};Oui.
Yes.;Non.${prompt}
No.${prompt};Eh bien alors, bienvenue...
Well then, welcome...;Oui, bienvenue dans la paisible vieille Windurst. Les peureux qui ont été endormis par la paix sont accueillis avec enthousiasme ici.${prompt}
Yes, welcome to peaceful old Windurrrst. Scaredy-cats who have been dumbed down by the peace are enthusiastically received here.${prompt};Bon essai...
Good try...;Mais si vous allez tromper les gens, vous devriez au moins apprendre à mentir correctement.${prompt}
But if you're going to deceive people, you should at least learn how to lie properrrly.${prompt};Où allez-vous ?
Where are you heading?;Qu'est-ce qui vous amène en ville ?${prompt}
What brings you to town?${prompt};Que voulez-vous faire maintenant ?
What do you want to do right now?;${selection-lines}
${selection-lines};Sortir et combattre.
Head outside and battle.;Faire du shopping.
Go shopping.;Rassembler des informations.
Gather information.;Où suis-je ? Qui suis-je ?${prompt}
Where am I? Who am I?${prompt};Grrr... Tu es plus ardent que tu n'en as l'air. Je pourrais presque bien t'apprécier.${prompt}
Grrr... You'rrre more hot-blooded than you look. I could almost come to like you.${prompt};Mais à en juger par ton apparence délicate, je dirais que tu serais chanceux de battre un rarab, encore moins une mandragore, là-bas à Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
But judging from your delicate appearrrance, I'd say you'd be lucky to beat a rarab, let alone a mandragorrra, out there in Sarutabaruta.${prompt};Oh, au cas où tu ne le saurais pas, Sarutabaruta est le nom des plaines qui entourent Windurst.${prompt}
Oh, in case you didn't know, Sarutabaruta is the name of the grasslands that surround Windurst.${prompt};Si tu remontes cette pente derrière toi et que tu passes par la porte, tu arriveras à l'est de Sarutabaruta.${prompt}
If you go back up that slope behind you and pass through the gatehouse, you will come to East Sarutabaruta.${prompt};Sarutabaruta est plein de monstres faibles, donc même un débutant comme toi peut essayer de chasser là-bas.${prompt}
Sarutabaruta is full of weak monsters, so even a newbie like you can try to hunt there.${prompt};Mais sois averti.
But be warrrned.;Plus tu t'éloignes de la ville, plus les monstres deviennent forts, alors garde un œil sur ta carte.${prompt}
The furrrther you go away from town the strongerrr the monsters become, so keep an eye on your map.${prompt};Demande à tes camarades aventuriers pour des détails sur la meilleure façon de combattre ou de fuir. Je ne vais pas me donner la peine de te le dire moi-même.${prompt}
Ask your fellow adventurers for details on the best way to fight or flee. I can't be botherrred telling you myself.${prompt};Eh bien, j'ai assez aidé pour aujourd'hui. Je suis sûr que tu as compris l'idée.${prompt}
Well, I've helped you enough forrr today. I'm sure you get the idea.${prompt};La leçon de Nanaa Mihgo sur Windurst est terminée. J'ai réduit tes frais de scolarité à seulement 1000 gils. Allez, paie.${prompt}
Nanaa Mihgo's lesson on Windurst is overrr. I've discounted your tuition fee to a mere 1000 gil. Come on then, cough it up.${prompt};Payer les frais de scolarité ?
Pay the tuition fee?;${selection-lines}
${selection-lines};Pas question !
No way!;Bon, euh, d'accord...${prompt}
Well, er, okay...${prompt};Quoi !? Tu ne me paieras même pas un simple compliment, malgré mon aimable assistance !? Ne connais-tu pas l'étiquette élémentaire de l'aventurier ?${prompt}
What!? You won't pay me even a simple compliment, despite my kindly assistance!? Don't you know basic adventurrrer's etiquette?${prompt};Montre-moi ce que tu as dans ta bourse.${prompt}
Show me how much you've got in your purrrse.${prompt};Tu saisis vite, gamin. Je commence à penser que je pourrais bien t'apprécier.${prompt}
You catch on quick, kid. I'm beginning to think I could like you.${prompt};Arrête-toi là !${prompt}
Hold it right there!${prompt};Nanaa Mihgo !!!
Nanaa Mihgo!!!;Tu continues tes vieux tours pour escroquer les voyageurs de leur gil durement gagné, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
You're up to your old tricks of duping travelers out of their hard-earned gil, aren't you?${prompt};Nous, la “Brigade des Étoiles d'Oignon”, ne te laisserons pas t'en sortir comme ça !${prompt}
We, the “Star Onion Brigade,” won't let you get away with it!${prompt};Grrr, pas ces S.O.B. encore !
Grrr, not those S.O.B.'s again!;J'aurais réussi à m'en sortir, si ce n'était pour vous, gamins intrusifs !${prompt}
I would've gotten away with it, if it weren't for you meddling kids!${prompt};En raison de ce dérangement, je vais devoir mettre fin à ta leçon pour aujourd'hui !${prompt}
Due to this disturrrbance, I'll have to end your lesson forrr today!${prompt};Nous continuerons un autre jour, et c'est là que je collecterai mes frais.${prompt}
We'll continue anotherrr day, and that's when I'll collect my fee.${prompt};Hé, elle s'enfuit !
Hey, she's getting away!;Après elle !${prompt}
After her!${prompt};Hé～y, ne cours pas si vite !${prompt}
He～y, don't run so fasty-wasty!${prompt};<Soupir>......${prompt}
<Sigh>......${prompt};Ce mithwa est un vilain mithwa que nous appelons tous le Voleur de Chats.${prompt}
Dat mithwa is a weally bad mithwa we all call da Cat Burglar.${prompt};Si tu as besoin d'une vraie aide, dirige-toi vers la fontaine. Jack of Spades est en poste là-bas. Il t'enseignera tout ce que tu as besoin de savoir. Consulte la “Carte” pour trouver le chemin jusqu'à là-bas.${prompt}
If you need weal help, head towards da fountain. Jack of Spades is on guard around dere. He will teach you all you need to know. Check da “Map” to find da way dere.${prompt};Oh, et donnez ça à Jack.
Oh, and give Jack dis.;Vous pouvez le lui remettre en utilisant l'option « Échanger » du menu principal.${prompt}
You can give it to him by using da main menu's “Trade” option.${prompt};Ah, nous avons oublié de nous présenter. Nous sommes la Brigade de l'Oignon Étoilé ! Nous sommes les protecteurs d'un avenir plus brillant ! Ça vaut la peine de se souvenir de nous !${prompt}
Ah, we forgot to intwoduce ourselves. We are da Star Onion Bwigade! We are da pwotectors of a bwighter tomorrow! It'll pay you to wemember us!${prompt};Quoi... ? Faire des achats ?
What the...? Shopping?;Me poser la question est une perte de temps.${prompt}
Asking me's a waste of time.${prompt};Je veux dire une perte de mon temps, pas du vôtre ! Si vous devez demander, alors tout ce que je peux recommander, c'est de vous diriger vers le port de Windurst.${prompt}
I mean a waste of my time, not yourrrs! If you must ask, then all I can recommend is to head to Port Windurst.${prompt};Pour y aller, suivez la route de l'autre côté de cette fontaine.${prompt}
To get there, head down the road on the otherrr side of this fountain round.${prompt};Une fois au port, descendez vers les quais, où il y a trois boutiques en forme de bateau. Elles abritent une boutique de magie, une boutique d'armures et une boutique d'armes.${prompt}
Once in the porrrt, head down to the wharves, where there are three boat-shaped shops. They house a magic shop, an armor shop, and a weapon shop.${prompt};Si vous cherchez des boutiques dans la région du Bois de Windurst, il y a un magasin de produits généraux tout au fond, de l'autre côté de ces tentes là-bas. Vous trouverez aussi les boutiques de la Guilde des Travailleurs de l'Os et de la Guilde des Tisserands derrière là-bas !${prompt}
If you're looking for shops in the Windurst Woods area, there's a general goods store far over on the otherrr side of those tents there. You'll find the Boneworkers' Guild and Weavers' Guild shops back behind therrre too!${prompt};Et derrière la ferme de dhalmel, il y a une apothicaire mithra.${prompt}
And up behind the dhalmel farm, therrre's a Mithra apothecary.${prompt};Vous devriez déjà le savoir, mais vous pouvez gagner de l'argent en vendant les objets que les monstres laissent tomber après les avoir vaincus. Vous pouvez utiliser l'argent gagné pour acheter ce que vous voulez.${prompt}
You should know this already, but you can make money by selling the items that monsters drop after you defeat them. You can use the gil earrrned to buy whatever you want.${prompt};Le meilleur moyen de recueillir des informations est de parler à tous les habitants de la ville.${prompt}
The best way to gather inforrrmation is to speak to all the townsfolk.${prompt};Aujourd'hui, je vais vous donner quelques informations spéciales gratuitement... mais juste cette fois. Quel type d'information vous intéresse particulièrement ?${prompt}
Today I'll throw in some special tidbits for free...but just this once. What kind of information in particularrr are you interested in?${prompt};Demander des informations sur... ?
Ask for information on...?;${selection-lines}
${selection-lines};Aider les gens.
Helping people.;Patrouille contre les monstres.
Monster patrol.;Facile à gagner.
Easy money.;Recherche de travail.${prompt}
Looking for work.${prompt};Pourquoi ne pas essayer l'atelier Cardian du Manustery là-haut ? Vous n'aiderez pas seulement les gens, mais aussi les Cardians.${prompt}
Why not try the Manustery's Cardian worrrkshop up there? You won't only be helping people, but Cardians as well.${prompt};Oh, les Cardians sont les automates magiques qui fonctionnent comme les gardes de Windurst.${prompt}
Oh, Cardians are the magical automatons that function as the guarrrds of Windurst.${prompt};Si vous entrez dans cet atelier là-bas, vous en verrez plus que vous ne le voudriez probablement.${prompt}
If you go in that workshop there, you'll see morrre of them than you probably want to.${prompt};Personnellement, je préférerais que tous les Cardians soient rassemblés et détruits.${prompt}
Perrrsonally, I'd prefer if all the Cardians were rounded up and destroyed.${prompt};Hah ! S'il y avait autant de belles promesses de gains rapides, je l'aurais déjà fait.${prompt}
Hah! If therrre was such sweet talk of fast money, I'd have done it already.${prompt};Mais attendez une seconde.
But wait a second.;Laissez-moi voir... Qu'est-ce qui pourrait convenir à un débutant comme vous... ?${prompt}
Let me see... What could be suitable for a newbie like you...?${prompt};Connaissez-vous la Guilde des Ouvriers de l'Os au sud d'ici ? Si vous pratiquez assidûment ce métier, vous pourriez gagner de l'argent en synthétisant et en vendant des objets.${prompt}
You know the Boneworrrkers' Guild to the south of here? If you diligently practice that trade skill, you might make some money out of synthesizing and selling items.${prompt};Vous ne deviendrez pas riche du jour au lendemain, mais c'est un moyen relativement facile de gagner de l'argent. Eh bien, c'est un début, non ?${prompt}
You'rrre not going to strike it rich right away, but it's a relatively easy way to make money. Hey, it's a start, right?${prompt};Normalement, je dirais : « Allez massacrer ces Yagudo ! »${prompt}
Norrrmally, I'd say, “Go out and slaughter those Yagudo beastmen”!${prompt};Mais les Tarutaru de Windurst préfèrent maintenir la paix et essaient d'être amis avec les Yagudo.${prompt}
But the Tarutaru of Windurrrst like to keep the peace and are trying to be friends with the Yagudo.${prompt};À ce stade, tout ce que je peux vous recommander, c'est la ferme de dhalmel.${prompt}
So at this point, all I can recommend to you is the dhalmel farrrm.${prompt};Si vous partez vers le nord à partir d'ici, vous verrez les longs cous des dhalmel dépassant de la passerelle de la ferme. Renseignez-vous auprès du fermier. Elle est reconnaissante pour toute aide.${prompt}
If you head north from here, you'll see the long necks of the dhalmel sticking up over the farrrm's walkway. Inquire with the farrrmer. She's grateful for any help she can get.${prompt};Vous cherchez du travail, hein ? Alors rendez-vous à l'une des guérites.${prompt}
Looking for worrrk, huh? Then head to one of the gatehouses.${prompt};Il y en a une juste derrière vous. Le bâtiment en pierre là-bas est la Guérite Est. Elle est grouillante de ces gardes Mithra qui se pavanent.${prompt}
There's one right behind you. The stone building there is the Eastern Gatehouse. It's swarrrming with those preening Mithra guards.${prompt};Vous pouvez recevoir des missions des guérites si vous aimez vous porter volontaire pour votre pays. Personnellement, ça ne m'intéresse pas beaucoup, alors demandez des détails à la guérite.${prompt}
You can receive missions from the gatehouses if you're into volunteerrring for your country. Perrrsonally, I don't care much for it myself, so ask for details at the gatehouse.${prompt};Les missions sont des tâches de et pour le compte de la Fédération de Windurst, et diffèrent des demandes d'aide des habitants ordinaires.${prompt}
Missions are tasks from and on behalf of the Federation of Windurst, and differrr from the requests for help from general townsfolk.${prompt};Par exemple, si vous accomplissez une mission, vous recevez un certain nombre de points de rang.${prompt}
For instance, if you do so-and-so a mission, you are rewarrrded with a set number of rank points.${prompt};Accumulez suffisamment de points de rang et votre rang ou votre position dans ce pays augmentera. Mais pour ce qui me concerne, les récompenses ne valent pas l'effort.${prompt}
Collect enough rank points and your rank or position in this country will rise. But as far as I'm concerned, the rewards aren't worrrth the effort.${prompt};Hein ? Vous ne savez pas où vous mettez les pieds ? Pauvre de vous.${prompt}
Hm? You don't know left from right? You poorrr thing.${prompt};Nous sommes dans les Bois de Windurst, le district le plus à l'est des quatre districts de Windurst.${prompt}
This is Windurst Woods, the easternmost of the fourrr districts of Windurst.${prompt};Comme nous sommes près du Bomingo Round ici, je vais l'utiliser comme point de départ pour mon explication.${prompt}
Seeing as we're nearrr the Bomingo Round here, I'll use it as the starting point of my explanation.${prompt};Tout d'abord, si vous partez vers le sud depuis le rond-point, vous trouverez plusieurs boutiques tenues par les artisanes locales.${prompt}
Firrrst, if you head south from the round, there are several shops run by the local craftswomen.${prompt};Il y a la Guilde des Tisserands, qui est la spécialité des Tarutaru, et il y a la Guilde des Ouvriers de l'Os, qui est plus le domaine des Mithra. Ce sont la fierté et la joie de Windurst.${prompt}
There's the Weavers' Guild, which is the specialty of the Tarutaru, and there's the Boneworkers' Guild. which is more the Mithra's forte. These are the pride and joy of Windurst.${prompt};Si vous partez vers le nord depuis le rond-point, vous trouverez des routes menant à la ferme de dhalmel et aux Écuries de Chocobos. Suivez simplement l'agréable odeur de la nature.${prompt}
If you head north from the round, you'll find roads that lead to the dhalmel farm and Chocobo Stables. Just follow the sweet smell of naturrre.${prompt};Prenez la route vers le nord, et vous trouverez une apothicaire mêlée parmi les bosquets Mithra avec les maisons Mithra. Prenez la route vers le sud, et vous trouverez une maison de vente aux enchères.${prompt}
Take the road norrrth, and you'll find an apothecary mixed among the Mithra Groves with the Mithra houses. Take the road south, and you'll find an auction house.${prompt};Comparé aux autres districts, il n'y a presque pas de bâtiments Tarutaru dans les Bois de Windurst du tout. Cependant, le Manustery, l'un des cinq ministères, est juste là-bas.${prompt}
Compared to the other districts, there's hardly any Tarutaru buildings in Windurst Woods at all. However, the Manustery, one of the five ministries, is right therrre.${prompt};Ce bâtiment là-haut est l'atelier Cardian du Manustery. C'est là que sont fabriqués ces gardes Cardian.${prompt}
That building up high there is the Manustery's Cardian workshop. It's where those Cardian guards are manufacturrred.${prompt};Enfin, en partant vers l'ouest depuis le rond-point, vous arriverez à la zone résidentielle de Windurst.${prompt}
Finally, heading west from the round will take you to Windurst's residential area.${prompt};Si vous êtes citoyen de Windurst, vous pouvez utiliser l'une des Maisons Mog à l'intérieur de là-bas.${prompt}
If you're a citizen of Windurst, you can use one of the Mog Houses inside of therrre.${prompt};Demandez aux gardes à l'entrée pour plus de détails.${prompt}
Ask the guards at the entrance there forrr the details.${prompt};Eh bien bonjour, aventurier.
Why, hello there, adventurer.;J'ai un petit problème énigmatique que vous pourriez peut-être m'aider à résoudre...${prompt}
I have a puzzling little problem you might be able to help me with...${prompt};Il y a quelque temps, je suis entré en possession de quelque chose appelé ${item-article:1[2]}, et cela m’a vraiment donné des sueurs froides.${prompt}
A while ago, I came into the possession of something called ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, which has given me the spooks.${prompt};J’ai entendu dire que ses précédents propriétaires ont tous vécu les événements les plus bizarres.${prompt}
I've heard that its previous owners have all had the most bizarre things happen to them.${prompt};J’ai essayé de me débarrasser de ce fichu truc, mais il revient toujours vers moi. Alors... je me demandais si vous pouviez faire quelque chose à propos de ce ruban avant que je ne devienne complètement folle.${prompt}
I've tried to get rid of the damned thing, but somehow it keeps making its way back to me. So...I was wondering if you can do something about this ribbon before I go quite crazy.${prompt};Aider Roberta avec son ruban ?
Help Roberta with her ribbon?;${selection-lines}
${selection-lines};Accepter.
Accept.;Refuser.${prompt}
Decline.${prompt};Ne me dites pas que vous avez peur ! Vous aviez l'air du genre à pouvoir aider une vieille dame.${prompt}
Don't tell me you're too scared! Why, you looked like the type who could help an old lady.${prompt};J'ai presque peur de vous impliquer dans cette affaire, mais merci d'avoir accepté de m'aider. Manipulez-le avec précaution, maintenant...${prompt}
I'm almost afraid to get you caught up in this business as well, but thank you for agreeing to help me out. Handle it with care, now...${prompt};Eh bien re-bonjour, aventurier. J'ai toujours ce petit problème énigmatique auquel vous étiez censé m'aider...${prompt}
Why, hello again, adventurer. I still have that puzzling little problem you were supposed to be helping me out with...${prompt};Vous vous souvenez de ce ${item-singular:1[2]} que je vous ai donné ? Eh bien, par hasard, l’auriez-vous perdu ?${prompt}
Remember that ${item-singular: 1[2]} I gave you? Well, by any chance, did you happen to lose it?${prompt};Perdu le ruban ?
Lost the ribbon?;${selection-lines}
${selection-lines};Oui.
Yes.;Non.${prompt}
No.${prompt};Je le savais ! Je le savais !
I knew it! I knew it!;Vous ne me croirez jamais, mais ce ${item-singular:1[2]} que je vous ai donné est revenu vers moi encore une fois !${prompt}
You won't believe this, but that ${item-singular: 1[2]} I gave you somehow made its way back to me again!${prompt};S'il vous plaît. Je vous en prie. Faites quelque chose à propos de ce ruban avant qu'il ne me rende folle !${prompt}
Please. I beg you. Do something about this ribbon before it drives me crazy!${prompt};Vraiment ?

Hmm... No matter then...${prompt};Hé ${choice-player-gender}[Monsieur/Madame]...
Hey ${choice-player-gender}[Mister/Ma'am]...;Allez-vous me ramener chez moi...?${prompt}
Are you going to take me home...?${prompt};Ce ruban n'est pas à vendre, et je ne le rachèterais certainement pas à qui que ce soit. Pourtant, il parvient toujours à revenir ici vers moi. Que se passe-t-il... ?${prompt}
That ribbon is not for sale, and I certainly wouldn't buy it back from anyone. Yet, somehow it manages to come back here to me.

That ribbon is not for sale, and I certainly wouldn't buy it back from anyone. Yet, somehow it manages to come back here to me. What's going on...?${prompt};Vous n'avez pas besoin de me dire quoi que ce soit sur l'histoire de ce ruban. Je ne veux pas savoir.${prompt}
You don't have to tell me anything about the background of that ribbon. I don't want to know.${prompt};Dans ce monde étrange qui est le nôtre, certaines choses sont mieux laissées inconnues.${prompt}
In this weird world of ours, some things are better left unknown.${prompt};Alors... vous m'avez trouvé, hein ? Oui, je sais, je sais. Ne me dites pas--notre éditeur, le vieux Naiko-Paneiko, est tout excité de vouloir que nous lâchions nos scoops d'information, n'est-ce pasaru ?${prompt}
So...you've found me, huh? Yeah, I know, I know. Don't tell me--our editor, old Naiko-Paneiko, is all in a huff over wanting us to cough up our news scoops, rightaru?${prompt};Hmm... Que devrais-je faire ? Vous voyez, j'ai un super scoop, mais je n'ai pas pu confirmer s'il est vraiment vrai ou nonaru.${prompt}
Hmm... What should I do? You see, I have a great scoop, but haven't been able to confirm whether it is indeed true or notaru.${prompt};Alors je pourrais simplement vous laisser le prendre et le lui rapporter, mais une bonne reporter devrait toujours vérifier ses sources, n'est-ce pasaru ?${prompt}
So I could let you just take it to him, but a good reporter should always double-check her sources, rightaru?${prompt};Dites, peut-être pourriez-vous vérifier mon histoire et aller voir si les faits concordent avant de le soumettre à notre éditeuraru ? Peut-être pourriez-vous aussi obtenir l'aide de quelques autres aventuriers pour vous aider et servir de témoins... ?${prompt}
Say, perhaps you could check my story out, and go see if the facts match up before you submitaru it to him? Maybe you could also get a few other adventurers to help you out and serve as witnesses...?${prompt};Pour terminer votre travail en confirmant mon scoop d'information, dirigez-vous vers les profondeurs de la tour de magie orientale et découvrez si le repaire du Voleur de Chats existe vraiment là-basaru.${prompt}
To finish your job by confirming my news scoop, head into the depths of the eastern magic tower and find out whether the Cat Burglar's hideaway really does existaru there.${prompt};Je ne vous suggère pas d'entrer réellement dans son repaire, car le Voleur de Chats est sûr d'avoir des pièges dangereux et des gardes là-bas. Trouvez simplement l'entrée du lieu à l'arrière des Ruines de Horutoto... puis sortez de là au plus vite !${prompt}
I don'taru suggest that you actually go inside her hideaway, as the Cat Burglar is bound to have dangerous traps and guards there. Just find the entrance to the place at the back of the Horutoto Ruins...then get the hell outta there!${prompt};Je le savais ! Mes sources avaient raisonaru ! Filez vite voir mon éditeur avec le scoop avant que quelqu'un d'autre ne nous devance !${prompt}
I knew it! My sources were correctaru! Race on back to my editor with the scoop before someone else beats us to it!${prompt};Le prix Pulitzer-Bulitzer de cette année pour le journalisme est dans ma poche, c'est sûr ! Je m'assurerai de vous remercier dans mon discours de remerciement !${prompt}
This year's Pulitzer-Bulitzer Prize for journalism is in my pocket for sure! I'll make sure I thank you in my acceptance speech!${prompt};Le Voleur de Chats... ?
The Cat Burglar-wurglar...?;Oh, vous voulez dire Nanaa Mihgo ?
Oh, you mean Nanaa Mihgo?;Bien sûr que je la connais !${prompt}
Of course I know her!${prompt};On dit que les trésors qu'elle vole aux gens ne sont jamais retrouvés. C'est pourquoi les gardes Mithra ne peuvent jamais l'arrêter... il n'y a tout simplement aucune preuve !${prompt}
They say the treasures she steals from people are never-ever found again. That's why the Mithra guardy-wardies can never arrest her...there's just no proof!${prompt};Comme je le pensaisaru !
As I thoughtaru!;J'ai remporté le Prix Pulitzer-Bulitzer cette année pour mon scoop sur le Voleur de Chats !${prompt}
I won this year's Pulitzer-Bulitzer Prize for journalism with my scoop on the Cat Burglar!${prompt};Et tout ça grâce à vous pour avoir confirmé que c'était vrai. Je voulais vraiment vous remercier davantage, mais est-ce que cela suffira... ?${prompt}
And it's all thanks to you for helping confirm that it was true. I really want to thank you more, but will this do...?${prompt};J'ai hâte de voir notre prochain numéro exclusif.${prompt}
I can'taru wait to see our next exclusive issue.${prompt};Mon exposé sera certainement en tête de l'actualité. Mais je ne peux pas me reposer sur mes lauriers. Un bon reporter doit continuer à suivre la vérité, car aucune histoire ne se termine jamais vraiment.${prompt}
My exposé will be the top story for sure. But I can'taru rest on my laurels. A good reporter has to keep following the truth, as no story ever really ends.${prompt};Vous ne voyez pas que je suis occupée maintenant ? Laissez un peu de place à une fille, hein ?${prompt}
Can't you see I'm busy now? Give a girl a little brrreathing room, huh?${prompt};Vous avez bien mis le truc dans une boîte métallique et l'avez coulé dans la mer comme on vous l'a dit, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
You did put the you-know-what into a metal box and sink it in the sea as we were told to, didn't you?${prompt};Vous avez une chance de chat en enfer de me faire voler quelque chose comme ça à nouveau ! La prochaine fois, c'est vous qui volez et moi qui coule, d'accord ?${prompt}
You've got a cat's chance in hell of getting me to steal something like that again! Next time, you do the stealing, and I do the sinking, okay?${prompt};Oo～h... Aa～h... Ai～e... !
Oo～h... Aa～h... Ou～ch...!;Je ne pense pas que notre dernier cambriolage était une si bonne idée. Les blessures où j'ai été mordue par le truc me font toujours mal, sans parler de mon dos après avoir porté cette lourde boîte où je l'ai mis.${prompt}
I don't think our last burrrglary was such a good idea. The wounds where I was bitten by the you-know-what still ache, not to mention my back from carrying that heavy box I put it in.${prompt};Comment ça, mon exposé scoop a été volé !?${prompt}
What do you mean, my scoop exposé has been stolen!?${prompt};Ce sale Voleur de Chats pourri et fourbe ! Elle a fait une attaque préventive pour ne pas se faire prendre, c'est une catastrophe !${prompt}
That dirty, rotten, low-down Cat Burglar! She's made a preemptive strike so as not to be caught outaru. This is a cat-astrophe!${prompt};"Il semble que l'édition de cette semaine de ""Magic Paradise Weekly"" du Tarutaru Times va également être annulée.${prompt}"
Looks like this week's edition of the Tarutaru Times's “Magic Paradise Weekly” is going to be canceled as well.${prompt};Si je l'ai dit une fois, je l'ai dit mille fois... Nous devrions abandonner l'utilisation de ces stupides poupées magiques pour transmettre nos histoires et revenir à la méthode éprouvée des journaux et des magazines ! Nos histoires finissent toujours par ne jamais être racontées.${prompt}
If I said it once, I've said it a thousand times... We should give up on using those silly magic dolls to deliver our stories. and go back to the tried and true method of newspapers and magazines! Our stories always end up never getting told.${prompt};Quoi... ?
What...?;Vous avez apporté un Cardian que vous voulez que je regarde ?${prompt}
You've brought a Cardian that you want me to have a looky-wooky at?${prompt};Je vois...
I see...;Un épisode si malheureux a causé la cessation de fonctionnement de cette pauvre chose.${prompt}
Such a misfortunate episode has caused the poor thing to cease functioning.${prompt};L'Orbe de Mana - le cœur de ce Cardian - brille encore. Ce n'est pas juste un cas de déplétion d'énergie magique. Le cœur de cet enfant est brisé.${prompt}
The Mana Orb--the heart of this Cardian--is still glowing. This is not a mere case of magic energy depletion. This child's heart has been broken-woken.${prompt};Les Cardians sont des automates créés à l'aide de la magie, mais leur capacité à percevoir les émotions est similaire à celle des humains.${prompt}
Cardians are automaton dolls created with the help of magic, but their ability to perceive emotions is the same as us people.${prompt};Les sentiments sont quelque chose qui se transmet entre les gens en grandissant progressivement. Les Cardians se développent aussi en captant beaucoup de ces sentiments mais... parfois ces sentiments peuvent même les briser.${prompt}
Feelings are something transmitted between people as they gradually grow older. Cardians also develop by picking up many such feelings but, but...sometimes these feelings can even break them.${prompt};Ce Cardian que vous m'avez apporté a été fabriqué pendant les années de guerre, il a donc probablement ressenti sa juste part de chagrin au cours de sa vie.${prompt}
This Cardian you brought me was made during the war years, so it has probably felt its fair share of sorrow over its lifetime.${prompt};<Soupir>...
<Sigh>...;Je me demande si je peux guérir cette pauvre petite chose.${prompt}

First, I'll need to remove my father's old magic.

J'ai seulement besoin d'une seule carte de dix de coupes, pourriez-vous en obtenir une pour moi, s'il vous plaît ?${prompt}
In order to do that, I'll need to pair it off with its opposing Cardian Card--the ten of cups.

The magic that we use to breathe life into the automaton dollies can be very dangerousy if used incorrectly.${prompt};Elle n'a pas été aussi bien étudiée ou perfectionnée que la magie noire ou blanche. Souvent, son utilisation met le lanceur lui-même en danger.${prompt}
It hasn't been as thoroughly researched or perfected as black or white magicy.

Cardian Cards have the ability to dispel the magic that has been placed on Cardians...it's kind of like an emergency stop or self-destruct button.${prompt};Le père du ministre Apururu, l'ancien ministre de notre Manustère, pouvait même retirer la magie sans utiliser de cartes... mais sans lui pour nous montrer, c'est impossible pour nous de le faire.${prompt}

I see... You have no business with me. Sorry, but I have work I must return to, so please allow me to continue with it. Good day.${prompt};Si je peux me permettre, permettez-moi de vous parler un peu de San d'Oria...${prompt}
If I may, allow me to tell you a little about San d'Oria...${prompt};San d'Oria est une terre de l'épée et de grande foi. Elle est célèbre pour ses courageux chevaliers royaux et ses loyaux chevaliers du temple, son grand château royal et sa glorieuse cathédrale.${prompt}
San d'Oria is a land of the sword and of great faith. It is famous for its gallant Royal Knights and loyal Temple Knights, its grand regal chateau, and its glorious cathedral.${prompt};Les hymnes chantés dans la cathédrale sont particulièrement divins. Même les cœurs les plus endurcis ne peuvent s'empêcher d'être émus par eux.${prompt}
The hymns sung in the cathedral are particularly divine. Even the stoniest of hearts cannot help but be moved by them.${prompt};Il est plutôt impossible de dire que le gouvernement de Windurst est le système le plus logique. Cependant, les Tarutarus croient en leur Sybille des étoiles et entretiennent des liens solides les uns avec les autres.${prompt}
It is rather impossible to say that the Windurstian government is the most logical system. However, the Tarutaru believe in their Star Sibyl and maintain strong bonds with each other.${prompt};Et n'est-ce pas la foi et les liens de ses citoyens qui rendent un pays fort ? Ce n'est que lorsque les cœurs des individus sont unifiés qu'un gouvernement peut vraiment fonctionner.${prompt}
And is it not the faith and the bonds of its citizens that make a country strong? Only when the hearts of the individuals are unified can a government really work.${prompt};C'est le consulat de San d'Oria.
This is the consulate of San d'Oria.;Notre rôle est de servir et de protéger les citoyens de San d'Oria résidant à Windurst.${prompt}
Our role is to serve and protect the citizens of San d'Oria residing in Windurst.${prompt};Mais bien sûr, nous n'abandonnerons pas les citoyens non San d'Oriens qui ont besoin de notre aide. Car nous, les San d'Oriens, sommes en effet un peuple juste.${prompt}
But of course, we shan't forsake non-San d'Orian citizens who require our assistance. For we San d'Orians are indeed a just people.${prompt};La lumière brille là où il y a la droiture, alors ne craignez pas, citoyen de ${choice: 1}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]. Les soldats de San d’Oria ne dégaineront leur épée que au nom de la justice.${prompt}
The light shines where there is righteousness, so do not be afraid, citizen of ${choice: 1}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]. The soldiers of San d'Oria only unsheathe their swords in the name of justice.${prompt};La lumière ne brille que là où il y a la droiture. Compatriote de San d'Oria, ne perdez jamais la fierté que vous avez envers votre pays.${prompt}
The light shines only where there is righteousness. Fellow citizen of San d'Oria, never lose the pride you have in your country.${prompt};Bienvenue au consulat de San d'Oria.
Welcome to the consulate of San d'Oria.;Si vous souhaitez parler au consul Mourices, entrez dans son bureau par la porte à votre droite.${prompt}
If you wish to speak to Consul Mourices, enter his office through the door on your right.${prompt};Ah, vous êtes venu tout droit de San d'Oria, n'est-ce pas ? Votre dévouement envers la patrie est des plus admirables.${prompt}
So you've come all the way from San d'Oria, eh? Your dedication to serving the motherland is most admirable.${prompt};Malheureusement, je suis d'humeur massacrante aujourd'hui. Après avoir lu la demande de mission de Windurst, j'ai été profondément dégoûté.${prompt}
Unfortunately, I am in one of my moods today. After I read the mission request from Windurst, I became most disgusted.${prompt};Forine, veuillez expliquer à ${choice-player-gender}[ce brave homme/cette charmante dame] ici présente en quoi consiste la mission.${prompt}
Forine, please explain to the ${choice-player-gender}[brave man/nice lady] here what the mission entails.${prompt};Oui, Consul.
Yes, Consul.;Permettez-moi d'expliquer...${prompt}
Allow me to explain...${prompt};La mission du gouvernement de Windurst consiste à offrir une armure magique à Giddeus, le premier rempart de l'antre des Yagudo beastmen.${prompt}
The mission from the Windurstian government entails the oblation of magic armor to Giddeus, the frontline to the abode of the Yagudo beastmen.${prompt};Un bouclier magique vous sera remis à la tour des Cieux dans les murailles de Windurst. Votre mission est de le livrer dans la chambre aux trésors des Yagudo, profondément enfouie sous terre à Giddeus.${prompt}
A magic shield will be handed to you at Heavens Tower in Windurst Walls. Your orders are to deliver it to the Yagudo treasure chamber, deep in the underground of Giddeus.${prompt};Avez-vous eu la malchance de rencontrer les Yagudo ? Ils ont pris l'habitude détestable d'attaquer les voyageurs qui traversent Sarutabaruta en bande...${prompt}
Have you had the misfortune of meeting the Yagudo yet? They have made a nasty practice out of ganging up to attack the travelers who pass through Sarutabaruta...${prompt};"Ce sont les mêmes beastmen qui se sont rangés du côté de ""l'Alliance"" il y a vingt ans, et ont tué bon nombre de nos camarades lors de la guerre.${prompt}"
These are the same beastmen who sided with “the Kindred” twenty years ago, and killed many of our comrades in the war.${prompt};Cependant, les Windurstiens sont devenus trop complaisants et montrent leur amour de la pacifisme - même si ce n'est rien de plus qu'une façade unilatérale - en nouant des relations amicales avec les Yagudo beastmen.${prompt}
However, the Windurstians have grown too complacent and show their love of pacifism--even if it is nothing more than a one-sided façade--by forming amicable relations with the Yagudo beastmen.${prompt};Et maintenant, ils osent demander à nous, fiers San d'Oriens, de porter un tribut à une bande de beastmen. C'en serait presque risible si ce n'était pas un tel affront.${prompt}
And now they dare ask us proud San d'Orians to carry a tribute to a pack of beastmen. It would almost be laughable if it wasn't such a slap in the face.${prompt};Cependant, cette mission doit être accomplie dans le cadre de notre engagement envers Windurst. Nous, les Elvaan, ne sommes pas du genre à rompre nos promesses, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
However, this mission has to be accomplished as part of our pledge to Windurst. We Elvaan are not ones to break our promises, are we?${prompt};Et pourtant, en tant que San d'Oriens, nous ne pouvons permettre que cette injustice reste impunie.${prompt}
And yet, at the same time, as San d'Orians, we cannot allow this injustice to go unchecked.${prompt};La situation est des plus exaspérantes. Cependant, je dois vous ordonner de partir et de donner le bouclier magique aux Yagudo. Mais en même temps, je vous supplie de priver les autres Yagudo que vous rencontrerez en chemin de deux de leurs boucliers, afin de compenser le déséquilibre.${prompt}
The situation is most exasperating. However, I must command you to go and give the Yagudo their magic shield. But at the same time, I entreat you to deprive the other Yagudo you meet along the way of two of their shields, making up for the imbalance.${prompt};Allez, en avant !${prompt}
Now, off with you!${prompt};Aussi exaspérante que soit la situation, je dois vous ordonner d'aller donner le bouclier magique aux Yagudo. En même temps, je vous en supplie, privés les Yagudo que vous rencontrerez en chemin du double du nombre de boucliers pour compenser le déséquilibre.${prompt}
However exasperating the situation, I must command you to go give the Yagudo their magic shield. At the same time, I entreat you to deprive the Yagudo you meet along the way twice the number of the shields to make up for the imbalance.${prompt};Aucun Elvaan ne ferait quelque chose d'aussi déshonorant que de rompre une promesse envers un autre.${prompt}
No Elvaan would ever do something as dishonorable as breaking a promise to another.${prompt};Votre mission est de vous rendre à la tour des Cieux dans les murailles de Windurst, où un bouclier magique vous sera remis.${prompt}
Your orders are to proceed to Heavens Tower in Windurst Walls, where a magic shield will be handed to you.${prompt};Afin d'accomplir cette mission telle que l'a assignée Windurst, vous devez livrer le bouclier à la chambre aux trésors des Yagudo, profondément sous terre à Giddeus. Mais ce n'est pas tout...${prompt}
In order to accomplish this mission as assigned by Windurst, you are to deliver the shield to the Yagudo treasure chamber, deep underground in Giddeus. However, that is not all...${prompt};Bien que nous ne puissions rompre notre promesse envers les Windurstiens, pour assurer que la justice soit rendue, nous aimerions secrètement que vous preniez deux boucliers aux Yagudo que vous rencontrerez en chemin.${prompt}
While we cannot break our promise to the Windurstians, to ensure justice is served, we would secretly like you to take two shields off of the Yagudo who you meet en route.${prompt};Agissez selon nos convictions tout en remplissant notre promesse envers les Tarutaru. C'est en effet une voie appropriée pour nous, le peuple de la glorieuse San d'Oria.${prompt}
Act according to our convictions while fulfilling our promise with the Tarutaru. This is indeed a fitting course for us, the people of glorious San d'Oria.${prompt};Imbécile !
Fool!;N'avez-vous pas entendu correctement nos ordres ? Ou cherchez-vous simplement à déclencher une guerre ?${prompt}
Did you not hear our orders correctly? Or are you just out to start a war?${prompt};Ne pouvez-vous pas vous retourer la partie la plus importante de la mission ? Vous deviez livrer un bouclier magique à la chambre aux trésors des Yagudo. Et vous vous appelez San d'Orien !?${prompt}
Can you not remember the most important part of the mission? You had to deliver a magic shield to the Yagudo treasure chamber. And you call yourself a San d'Orian!?${prompt};Imbécile !${prompt}
Fool!${prompt};Vous avez seulement remis le bouclier magique de Windurst aux Yagudo et êtes parti en courant, laissant l'équilibre du pouvoir biaisé. Une telle action serait considérée comme une trahison à San d'Oria !!!${prompt}
You only handed over Windurst's magic shield to the Yagudo and skipped back, leaving the balance of power skewed. Such action would be considered treason back in San d'Oria!!!${prompt};Humph. Il semble que vous ayez su maintenir le chemin de la droiture.${prompt}
Humph. Seems as if you were able to maintain the path of righteousness.${prompt};Vous devez maintenant vous rendre au consulat de San d'Oria à Bastok.${prompt}
You are now to head to the Consulate of San d'Oria in Bastok.${prompt};Savez-vous comment vous rendre à Bastok à partir d'ici ? Vous pouvez voyager par mer depuis Mhaura jusqu'à Selbina. De là, vous devez traverser les hautes terres vers le sud.${prompt}
Do you know the way to Bastok from here? You can travel by sea from Mhaura back to Selbina. From there, you have to cross the highlands to the south.${prompt};Gloire au Royaume de San d'Oria.
Glory to the Kingdom of San d'Oria.;Adieu et bon voyage.${prompt}
Farewell and safe passage.${prompt};Dirigez-vous vers le Consulat de San d'Oria à Bastok.${prompt}
Head to the Consulate of San d'Oria in Bastok.${prompt};Le meilleur moyen de se rendre à Bastok d'ici est de prendre un navire de Mhaura à Selbina. De là, vous devez traverser les hautes terres vers le sud.${prompt}
The best way to journey to Bastok from here is to ride a ship from Mhaura back to Selbina. From there, you have to cross the highlands to the south.${prompt};La République de Bastok est occupée par deux races, les Humes et les Galkas, qui sont exactement l'antithèse l'une de l'autre.${prompt}
The Republic of Bastok is occupied by two races, the Hume and the Galka, who are the exact antithesis of each other.${prompt};Parfois, ils se battent, il est donc impératif que vous mainteniez la neutralité pendant que vous évaluez la situation, puis vous joignez aux justes.${prompt}
Occasionally they break out into fights, so it is imperative that you maintain neutrality as you assess the situation and then avail yourself to the righteous ones.${prompt};Maintenant que vous avez accompli cette petite mission d'amitié, vous êtes de nouveau un simple citoyen de San d'Oria. Vous êtes donc libre d'aller à Giddeus et de vraiment donner à ces bêtes ce qu'elles méritent.${prompt}
Now that you have completed that little mission of amity, you are just an ordinary San d'Orian citizen again. So that frees you to go to Giddeus and really give those beastmen what they deserve.${prompt};Cependant, nous ne prendrons pas la responsabilité si vous êtes sérieusement blessé dans le processus.${prompt}
However, we shan't take responsibility if you get seriously hurt in the process.${prompt};Vos efforts sont bien notés. Prenez soin de votre voyage à Bastok.${prompt}
Your efforts are well noted. Take care on your journey to Bastok.${prompt};Donc, vous êtes venu tout le chemin depuis San d'Oria, hein ? Votre dévouement au service de la mère patrie est des plus admirables.${prompt}

Forine, please explain to the ${choice-player-gender}[brave man/nice lady] here what the mission entails.${prompt};Oui, Consul.
Yes, Consul.;Permettez-moi d'expliquer la demande de Windurst...${prompt}
Allow me to explain Windurst's request...${prompt};Un monstre géant est apparu dans les profondeurs de Giddeus, le territoire frontalier du théocratie des Yagudos. Le gouvernement de Windurst veut l'exterminer.${prompt}
A giant monster has appeared in the depths of Giddeus, the borderland to the theocracy of the Yagudo beastmen. The Windurstian government wants it exterminated.${prompt};Vous devez recevoir une clé de la Tour des Cieux dans le quartier des Murs de Windurst et vous diriger vers la partie la plus profonde de Giddeus, où la créature vous attend.${prompt}
You are to receive a key from Heavens Tower in the Windurst Walls district and head to the innermost part of Giddeus, where the creature awaits.${prompt};Ha-ha ! Quelle histoire joyeuse. Un monstre féroce apparaissant au cœur de Giddeus, effrayant tellement les Yagudos qu'ils demandent aux Tarutarus de les aider ?${prompt}
Ha-ha! What a jolly tale that is. A ferocious monster appearing in the heart of Giddeus, scaring the Yagudo so much they ask Tarutaru to help them?${prompt};C'est très chanceux pour ces bêtes que le gouvernement de Windurst ait cherché des relations amicales avec eux afin de maintenir la paix de leur pays.${prompt}
It's most fortunate for those beastmen that the Windurst government had sought amicable relations with them in order to maintain the peace of their country.${prompt};Quoi ? Ne me dites pas que vous n'avez pas entendu parler du petit pacte de paix de Windurst avec les Yagudos ?${prompt}
What? Don't tell me you hadn't heard of Windurst's little peace pact with the Yagudo?${prompt};Bien sûr, nous, San d'Oriens, n'avons aucun besoin de montrer à ces vulgaires bêtes aucune courtoisie, mais c'est un accord entre nos deux pays, donc nous n'avons d'autre choix que de le respecter.${prompt}
Of course, we San d'Orians have no need to show to those vulgar beastmen any courtesy whatsoever, but this is an agreement between our two countries, so we have no choice but to go through with it.${prompt};Allez donc exterminer le monstre féroce qui sévit dans les profondeurs de Giddeus, mais ne pensez pas que vous devez vous retenir de donner également à ces Yagudos pleurnicheurs ce qu'ils méritent.${prompt}
So go ahead and exterminate the ferocious monster plaguing the depths of Giddeus, but don't think you have to hold back from also giving those whining beastmen what they deserve.${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit, assez de bavardages.
Anyway, enough chatter.;Bonne chance dans votre mission.${prompt}
Godspeed on your assignment.${prompt};Allez et exterminiez le monstre féroce qui sévit dans les profondeurs de Giddeus, mais ne vous retenez pas de donner également à ces Yagudos pleurnicheurs ce qu'ils méritent.${prompt}
Go and exterminate the ferocious monster plaguing the depths of Giddeus, but don't hold back from also giving those whining beastmen what they deserve.${prompt};Pour accéder à la partie la plus profonde de Giddeus, vous devez recevoir la clé de la Tour des Cieux dans le quartier des Murs de Windurst.${prompt}
To access the innermost part of Giddeus, you must receive the key from Heavens Tower in the Windurst Walls district.${prompt};Revenez ici une fois que vous avez vaincu le monstre féroce qui menace les Yagudos dans les profondeurs de Giddeus.${prompt}
Report back here once you have defeated the ferocious monster that is menacing the Yagudo in the depths of Giddeus.${prompt};Je ne chercherais pas à priver les Tarutarus de cette terre de poursuivre la paix. C'est juste que je désire une paix durable, pas la façade temporaire qu'a maintenant Windurst.${prompt}
I would not try to deny the Tarutaru of this land from pursuing peace. It is just that I desire lasting peace, not the temporary façade that Windurst has now.${prompt};La tranquillité apparente de cet endroit peut être considérée comme une illusion née de l'idéalisme. Jusqu'à ce que nous réveillions Windurst de son rêve, elle continuera à être hors d'aide.${prompt}
The apparent tranquility of this place can be considered an illusion born from idealism. Until we wake Windurst from its dream it will continue to be beyond help.${prompt};Devenir soldat est un mode de vie complètement différent de celui d'un simple combattant.${prompt}
Becoming a soldier is a completely different way of life than being a mere fighter.${prompt};Vous êtes pris entre des ordres complexes et la chevalerie, et parfois vous devez aller à l'encontre de vos convictions personnelles...${prompt}
You are caught between intricate orders and chivalry, and sometimes you have to go against your personal convictions...${prompt};De quoi parlez-vous ? Le Seigneur des Ombres est en train d'être ressuscité !?${prompt}

What are you dawdling for, ${choice-player-gender}[boy/girl]?

Consul Mourices's face has blanched. Did you say something to upset him? Did you not complete your mission correctly?${prompt};Le monstre féroce était vraiment un piège tendu par les bêtes... ? Quel horrible retournement de situation cela s'est avéré être.${prompt}
The ferocious monster was really a trap set by the beastmen...? What a horrid turn of events this has proved to be.${prompt};De plus, il est question de l'apparition d'une bête des ténèbres ?
Moreover, there is talk of a nether beast appearing?;Est-ce possible... ? Non ! Ne me dites pas que nous nous lançons droit vers une autre Grande Guerre ?${prompt}

He digs till his last breathy.${prompt};Rrralentis, Soni-Muni !
His eye carved out by a briny blusterrr;J'ai entendu que ce labyrinthe n'est pas une simple promenade. Nous n'avons aucune chance à notre niveau actuel, alors il vaudrait mieux s'entraîner d'abord !${prompt}
His heart pierced by a scorpion's sting;C'est ce que je disais depuis le début ! On aurait pu être dehors à monter de niveau au lieu de rester là toute la journée ! Arrrgh !!!${prompt}

Beneath the earth sleeps that pirate king.${prompt};Notre cheftaine a récemment invité Semih Lafihna pour ouvrir le dialogue, mais Semih Lafihna n'a pas accepté l'offre.${prompt}
Who'd have thought there were scorpions in the ol' Maze of Shakhrami!? We've gotta go check this out, eh, Gottah!? Oh, and thanks a lot, adventurer.${prompt};Ce n'est pas vraiment une surprise. Pour Semih Lafihna, son héritage Mithra n'a aucune importance dans sa position dans la société Tarutaru. Elle aurait aussi bien pu naître Tarutaru.${prompt}
Hold your horrrses, Soni-Muni!;Je me demande si la cheftaine allait lui dire la vérité. Mais je suppose que peu importe si la vérité est dite ou non, la rancune restera forte entre elles.${prompt}
I've hearrrd that maze is no walk in the park. We don't stand a chance at our current level, so we'd better get some trainin' in firrrst!${prompt};Rien ne changerait vraiment...
That's what I've been sayin'-wayin' all this time! We could have been out there levelin' up instead of standin' here all day! Arrrgh!!!${prompt};Mais c'est une affaire qui échappe à nos pattes...${prompt}
But then we wouldn't have heard the lowdown on the Maze of Shakhrami, would we? Rrright?${prompt};Par respect pour notre ancienne cheftaine, nous devons aider à préparer le couronnement de Semih Lafihna en tant que nouvelle cheftaine.${prompt}
Our chieftainness recently invited Semih Lafihna over to open dialogue, but Semih Lafihna did not take her up on the offerrr.${prompt};Je suppose que tu as raison...
That's no rrreal surprise. As far as Semih Lafihna is concerned, her Mithran heritage is of no consequence in her position in Tarutaru society. Why, she may as well have been born a Tarutaru.${prompt};Oh, et quel bon timing, car un aventurier passe justement par ici ! Pourquoi ne pas lui demander s'il peut nous aider dans cette tâche ?${prompt}
I wonderrr if the chieftainness was going to tell her the truth. But I guess it doesn't matter whetherrr the truth is told or not, as the bad blood will still run thick between them.${prompt};Oui, faisons cela... Excusez-moi, ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame]...
Nothing rrreally would change...;Vous ne compteriez pas chasser des monstres dans les Monts Mériphataud prochainement, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
But that is a matter which is out of our paws...${prompt};Excusez-moi ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame]...
Out of honor for our old chieftainness, we must help in the preparations to crown Semih Lafihna as the new chieftainness.${prompt};Vous ne compteriez pas chasser des monstres dans les Monts Mériphataud prochainement, n'est-ce pas ?${prompt}
I guess you are right...;Oh bien, vous en avez trouvé un.
Oh, and what good timing, for there is an adventurerrr passing by now! Why don't we ask ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] whetherrr ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] can help us out with that task?${prompt};Tenez, je vous donne ceci en signe de notre reconnaissance...${prompt}
Yes, let's... Excuse me, ${choice-player-gender}[sir/miss]...;(J'espère juste que cela pourra s'adapter correctement à l'autre gemme...)${prompt}
You wouldn't be intending to hunt monsters in the Meriphataud Mountains any time soon, would you?${prompt};Au fond des Monts Mériphataud, il y a une forteresse des Yagudo appelée Château d'Oztroja. C'est un endroit où de terribles guerres ont été menées.${prompt}

Here, I'll give you this as a sign of our appreciation...${prompt};Bienvenue à la maison de ventes aux enchères.
(I just hope it can fit that other gem properly...)${prompt};Avez-vous des questions sur notre établissement ?${prompt}
Deep in the Meriphataud Mountains, there is a bastion of the Yagudo called Castle Oztroja. It is a place where terrific wars were fought.${prompt};Que voulez-vous savoir ?
Innumerable Mithran fighters were felled there. This ${item-singular: 1[2]} belonged to one of those fallen warriors.${prompt};${selection-lines}
Twinstones are, as their name suggests, a perrrfect pair of gemstones that are originally found joined as one.${prompt};Qu'est-ce que la maison de ventes aux enchères ?
No otherrr stones can come close to matching them once they are separated. Since they were once a single stone, only their corresponding halves fit perrrfectly back as one.${prompt};Comment se déroulent les enchères ?
Utilizing this very properrrty, twinstones are used as proof of bonds between Mithra back in our homeland.${prompt};Y a-t-il des frais ?
Hello again, adventurer.;Y a-t-il des limites ?
May I again make the same rrrequest as I did before.? I'd like you to search for ${item-plural: 1[2]} in the Meriphataud Mountains.${prompt};Comment vérifier les marchandises ?
I'll pay a good price for any that you find. Once you find one, please bring it back to me as promptly as you can.${prompt};Comment retirer un article ?
Welcome to the auction house.;Ma liste “Statut des ventes” est pleine !
Do you have any questions about our establishment?${prompt};Rien pour le moment.${prompt}
What do you want to know?;Les maisons de ventes aux enchères se trouvent dans toutes les grandes villes de Vana'diel. Ici, les aventuriers se rassemblent pour enchérir sur les butins de bataille, les objets indésirables, les anciennes armures... presque tout.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Actuellement, les maisons de ventes aux enchères à Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, et Jeuno fonctionnent toutes de manière indépendante. Par conséquent, les prix varient d'une ville à l'autre.${prompt}
What is the auction house?;Les aventuriers peuvent utiliser n'importe quelle maison de ventes aux enchères, quel que soit leur nationalité.${prompt}
How are auctions run?;Le premier aventurier à enchérir au prix demandé ou au-dessus de celui-ci achètera automatiquement le produit.${prompt}
Are there any fees?;Une fois mis aux enchères, les marchandises y resteront pendant un maximum de trente semaines de Vana'diel (neuf jours et demi en temps terrestre).${prompt}
Are there any limits?;Si les marchandises ne sont pas vendues dans ce délai, elles seront retournées à la résidence actuelle du vendeur.${prompt}
How do you check up on merchandise?;Les frais de transaction sont proportionnels au montant pour lequel un article est mis aux enchères. La méthode de calcul de ces frais est différente pour les articles individuels et les articles empilables.${prompt}
How do you remove an item?;Un frais de transaction est prélevé lorsque des marchandises sont mises aux enchères. Ce frais est non remboursable.${prompt}
My “Sales Status” list is full!;Le Comité International des Ventes aux Enchères, ou CIVE, a déclaré qu'un maximum de sept articles peut être mis aux enchères en même temps.${prompt}
Nothing right now.${prompt};Cependant, le CIVE a récemment supprimé la limite du nombre d'articles que l'on peut acheter.${prompt}
Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.${prompt};Un certain temps est nécessaire avant que de nouvelles marchandises apparaissent sur notre liste d'enchères.${prompt}
Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.${prompt};Une fois qu'un article apparaît sur votre liste “Statut des ventes”, il peut ne pas immédiatement apparaître sur la liste des enchères. Si vous ne voyez pas votre article sur la liste des enchères, essayez de regarder à nouveau plus tard.${prompt}
Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.${prompt};Si vous souhaitez retirer un article d'une enchère, vous devez vous rendre à la maison de ventes aux enchères, et sélectionner “Arrêter la vente” dans le menu “Statut des ventes”.${prompt}
The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.${prompt};Pour retirer un article de votre liste “Statut des ventes”, vous devez vous rendre à un comptoir d'enchères pour reconnaître la vente ou le retour de votre marchandise.${prompt}
Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).${prompt};Sinon, les articles précédemment vendus ou retournés rempliront votre liste et vous empêcheront de vendre d'autres marchandises.${prompt}
If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.${prompt};À n'importe quel comptoir d'enchères, ouvrez le menu “Statut des ventes” et reconnaissez la transaction pour la supprimer de la liste.${prompt}
Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.${prompt};Appuyez sur le bouton de confirmation pour supprimer toute transaction colorée en jaune (vendue) ou en rouge (retournée).${prompt}
A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.${prompt};Y a-t-il autre chose que vous voudriez savoir ?${prompt}
The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.${prompt};Par le passé, beaucoup ont amassé de grandes richesses grâce à la maison de ventes aux enchères. J'espère que vous trouverez fortune, vous aussi !${prompt}
However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.${prompt};Vana'diel est en effervescence avec la “Reconnaissance des Aventuriers”, kupo !${prompt}
A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.${prompt};Nous, les mogs, avons préparé de petites surprises et rassemblé plein d'informations top secrètes sur l'activité des aventuriers, kupo !
Once an item appears on your “Sales Status” list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.${prompt};Laissez-moi consulter mon journal pour vos données statistiques...${prompt}
If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select “Stop Sale” from the “Sales Status” menu.${prompt};Voilà votre vie d'aventurier en un clin d'œil !${prompt}
To remove an item from your “Sales Status” list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.${prompt};Voilà votre vie d'aventurier en un clin d'œil !
Otherwise, previously sold or returned items will fill up your list and prevent you from selling any more merchandise.${prompt};Et cette fois, il y a un cadeau d'anniversaire extra-spécial ! Oh, faites juste attention à ne pas le jeter accidentellement ou quoi que ce soit, car vous ne pourrez jamais en obtenir un autre... jamais, kupo !${prompt}
At any auction counter, open the “Sales Status” menu and acknowledge the transaction to clear it from the list.${prompt};Lequel souhaitez-vous ? (${number: 0} restant)
Press the confirm button to remove any transaction colored yellow (sold) or red (returned).${prompt};${selection-lines}
Is there anything else you would like to know?${prompt};J'ai besoin de temps pour réfléchir.
In the past, many have amassed great wealth through the auction house. I hope you find fortune, too!${prompt};Ah, je comprends. Avec tant de surprises à choisir, il n'est pas surprenant que vous vouliez réfléchir un peu plus. Je serai ici une fois que vous aurez décidé, kupo.${prompt}
Vana'diel is abuzz with “Adventurer Appreciation” fever, kupo!${prompt};${selection-lines}

${selection-lines};I was looking for you.
Have fun, kupo!;It seems like you've been prrracticing to become a master thief.${prompt}
No, I am your only friend now!${prompt};Usually I don't mingle with my competition, but the Tenshodo has put out a call for able-bodied thieves.${prompt}
Oh, thank you, master!;The Tenshodo came to us, so don't even think of turning down their offer.${prompt}
My moogle friends live across the seas, so I have another favor to ask you, kupo!${prompt};Well, I'll see you in Jeuno!
The sun beats down mercilessly in the land beyond the west sea, so I need to take ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]} for my friends there, kupo!${prompt};As those little wizards say, ta-taru!${prompt}
And my other buddies need ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]} for the torrential rains that scour the lands across the east sea, kupo!${prompt};I'll see you at the Tenshodo headquarters in Jeuno.${prompt}
I can't help out my friends if I don't have ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 6[2]}, kupo...${prompt};The Tenshodo is one of the biggest dealers of merchandise in all of Vana'diel. An adventurer like you has surely heard of it.${prompt}
I'll be sure to bring you a souvenir from my overseas trip, kupo! See you in a few days, master!${prompt};Ahh, Jeuno... How long has it been since I last got my paws into the pockets of those bigwigs?${prompt}
Master!;You say you've already met up with the rrremains of Atarefaunet's band? Did they tell you anything?${prompt}
I'm back from visiting my old moogle friends, kupo!${prompt};The guy I talked to was acting like he was so much better than us. He sure rrrubbed my fur the wrrrong way.${prompt}
We all got together and made you a new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 80 items, kupo!${prompt};You don't hearrr the name Atarefaunet around these parts that often. I heard that he was pretty famous in the west, though.${prompt}
I was looking for you.;At the time, Atarefaunet's band was loaded with the best of the best. They say that some of the memberrrs were even professional killers, so you had better watch your back.${prompt}
It seems like you've been prrracticing to become a master thief.${prompt};<Sigh> The top cat can surrre be difficult at times...${prompt}
Usually I don't mingle with my competition, but the Tenshodo has put out a call for able-bodied thieves.${prompt};The weapon you got... What's it like?${prompt}
The Tenshodo came to us, so don't even think of turning down their offer.${prompt};Getting such a fine weapon for such a cakewalk job... It's almost like stealing!${prompt}
Well, I'll see you in Jeuno!;Ah, I've been looking for you.
As those little wizards say, ta-taru!${prompt};You know how we got those papers from the Tenshodo and delivered them individually?${prompt}
I'll see you at the Tenshodo headquarters in Jeuno.${prompt};Did you check the signature you got from the Atarefaunet member before giving the papers to Vauderame?${prompt}
The Tenshodo is one of the biggest dealers of merchandise in all of Vana'diel. An adventurer like you has surely heard of it.${prompt};You know, the last signature on the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}? It was a single letter. Did you see it?${prompt}
Ahh, Jeuno... How long has it been since I last got my paws into the pockets of those bigwigs?${prompt};Did you see the signature?

The guy I talked to was acting like he was so much better than us. He sure rrrubbed my fur the wrrrong way.${prompt};Yes.
You don't hearrr the name Atarefaunet around these parts that often. I heard that he was pretty famous in the west, though.${prompt};No.${prompt}
At the time, Atarefaunet's band was loaded with the best of the best. They say that some of the memberrrs were even professional killers, so you had better watch your back.${prompt};Are you rrreally a thief?
<Sigh> The top cat can surrre be difficult at times...${prompt};Un-be-liev-able!!${prompt}
The weapon you got... What's it like?${prompt};Let me tell you, then.
Getting such a fine weapon for such a cakewalk job... It's almost like stealing!${prompt};The signature you got was a “V.”${prompt}
Ah, I've been looking for you.;How do I know, you ask?
You know how we got those papers from the Tenshodo and delivered them individually?${prompt};I can tell what's written on a piece of paper just by touching it.${prompt}
Did you check the signature you got from the Atarefaunet member before giving the papers to Vauderame?${prompt};Ah! That's my little thief!
You know, the last signature on the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}? It was a single letter. Did you see it?${prompt};...So, what was the letter?${prompt}
Did you see the signature?;What was the signature?
${selection-lines};${selection-lines}
Yes.;T
No.${prompt};A
Are you rrreally a thief?;V
Un-be-liev-able!!${prompt};I...forget.${prompt}
Let me tell you, then.;Rrright.
The signature you got was a “V.”${prompt};The signature you got was a “V.”${prompt}
How do I know, you ask?;But the prrroblem is, the initial you got doesn't match the initial of the member's name, rrright?${prompt}
I can tell what's written on a piece of paper just by touching it.${prompt};The signature that I got didn't match either.${prompt}
Ah! That's my little thief!;This didn't happen to only you and me. I also asked Esca of San d'Oria and Nbu Latteh of Bastok, and it was the same with them.${prompt}
...So, what was the letter?${prompt};Doesn't all this seem just a little bit fishy? Doesn't it get your whiskers twitching?${prompt}
What was the signature?;After that task, I did some digging on Atarefaunet's band. It seems that the treasure from the last big heist they pulled off has yet to be found.${prompt}
${selection-lines};The way I see it, those signatures were some sort of code. To contact the rrremaining members of Atarefaunet's band after all this time just doesn't make sense otherwise.${prompt}
T;Vauderame of the Tenshodo is searching for that treasure. So he threatens Atarefaunet's cutthroats, and collects the code letters...${prompt}
A;I'm gonna collect the signatures from the other six members. Will you help me?${prompt}
V;Help out?
I...forget.${prompt};${selection-lines}
Rrright.;Where do I sign?
The signature you got was a “V.”${prompt};I'll keep my paws out of this one...${prompt}
But the prrroblem is, the initial you got doesn't match the initial of the member's name, rrright?${prompt};Scaredy-cat! You'll never become a world-famous thief at this rate...${prompt}
The signature that I got didn't match either.${prompt};Are you up for it?${prompt}
This didn't happen to only you and me. I also asked Esca of San d'Oria and Nbu Latteh of Bastok, and it was the same with them.${prompt};Okay, take these.
Doesn't all this seem just a little bit fishy? Doesn't it get your whiskers twitching?${prompt};I made copies of the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} you rrreceived before. Use them in the same way to get signatures from those brrrigands.${prompt}
After that task, I did some digging on Atarefaunet's band. It seems that the treasure from the last big heist they pulled off has yet to be found.${prompt};Huh? What should you say?
The way I see it, those signatures were some sort of code. To contact the rrremaining members of Atarefaunet's band after all this time just doesn't make sense otherwise.${prompt};I'm sure you'll think of something...${prompt}
Vauderame of the Tenshodo is searching for that treasure. So he threatens Atarefaunet's cutthroats, and collects the code letters...${prompt};The last obstacle is finding the members' hideouts... At the moment, we know the location of two of the bandits, so why don't you go pay them a visit?${prompt}
I'm gonna collect the signatures from the other six members. Will you help me?${prompt};We tailed them to their hideouts. Herrre, I wrote the locations down for you.${prompt}
Help out?;If the top cat says something is fishy, you better believe it!${prompt}
${selection-lines};First things first! Get ahold of those signatures. Oh, and by the way, don't even think of drrropping this little errand halfway through...${prompt}
Where do I sign?;The location of the hideouts are wrrritten on the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, right?${prompt}
I'll keep my paws out of this one...${prompt};Find the hideouts, and get those signatures. Go on, shoo!${prompt}
Scaredy-cat! You'll never become a world-famous thief at this rate...${prompt};From what I saw, to meet with the member in the Goblin store in Jeuno, you have to try your hand at a game of chance.${prompt}
Are you up for it?${prompt};Esca was furrrious at being forced to play over and over just because of her bad luck. Are you feeling lucky?${prompt}
Okay, take these.;Just a minute!
I made copies of the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} you rrreceived before. Use them in the same way to get signatures from those brrrigands.${prompt};I completely forgot. To climb the towerrr in Sauromugue Champaign, you need to have ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Huh? What should you say?;But even if you have one, you won't be getting up that tower if you're a fat cat!${prompt}
I'm sure you'll think of something...${prompt};Did you get those signatures? I have the last two rrright here.${prompt}
The last obstacle is finding the members' hideouts... At the moment, we know the location of two of the bandits, so why don't you go pay them a visit?${prompt};Okay, eight letters... Let's put them together...
We tailed them to their hideouts. Herrre, I wrote the locations down for you.${prompt};V, Z, A, N, A, T, A, I...${prompt}

The location of the hideouts are wrrritten on the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, right?${prompt};Here, take your loot and scoot. I'll let you know when I figure this out. Come and see me later.${prompt}

From what I saw, to meet with the member in the Goblin store in Jeuno, you have to try your hand at a game of chance.${prompt};Here, take your loot and scoot. I'll let you know when I figure this out. Come and see me later.${prompt}
Esca was furrrious at being forced to play over and over just because of her bad luck. Are you feeling lucky?${prompt};We had our troubles, too.
Just a minute!;The member I went after told me, “Thieves need to be fleet on their feet.” I had to chase that villain around for hourrrs.${prompt}
I completely forgot. To climb the towerrr in Sauromugue Champaign, you need to have ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};Ow, I hurt...
But even if you have one, you won't be getting up that tower if you're a fat cat!${prompt};What use is beauty in thieving?
Did you get those signatures? I have the last two rrright here.${prompt};My m-muscles are so sore!${prompt}
Okay, eight letters... Let's put them together...;I finally figured out the code. All those letters we got from the Atarefaunet band...I know what they mean.${prompt}
V, Z, A, N, A, T, A, I...${prompt};When I rrrearranged the order of the letters, I came out with “Tavnazia.”${prompt}
Hmm... If I put this here... Umm...${prompt};Tavnazia...
Huh? You still here?;In other words, the Tavnazian Marquisate. A nation to the west that was obliterated by the beastmen in the Great War.${prompt}
Here, take your loot and scoot. I'll let you know when I figure this out. Come and see me later.${prompt};Tavnazia pledged allegiance to San d'Oria and was ruled by Marquis Altedour. But after some investigation, I discovered some slightly more interesting facts.${prompt}
Huh? You still here?;Just before the nation was swarmed under by the beastmen, the knights of Tavnazia carried away the rrroyal treasure. However, the knights themselves were attacked by brigands and the treasure was stolen.${prompt}
Here, take your loot and scoot. I'll let you know when I figure this out. Come and see me later.${prompt};If you listen to the old thieves, they'll tell you it was the work of the Atarefaunet band. But since the leader of the band died, the truth is anybody's guess.${prompt}
We had our troubles, too.;Isn't this exciting?
The member I went after told me, “Thieves need to be fleet on their feet.” I had to chase that villain around for hourrrs.${prompt};The rrremaining members of the Atarefaunet band must hold the key to the location of the Tavnazian royal treasure!${prompt}
Ow, I hurt...;Vauderame of the Tenshodo must be arranging a deal with them to get his greedy hands on the goods.${prompt}
What use is beauty in thieving?;Now that I know his plans, I'll have to work my way into his circle and get my paws in the pie, too.${prompt}
My m-muscles are so sore!${prompt};Don't rrrush into anything just yet. There's something wrong. Vauderame hasn't made a move yet.${prompt}
I finally figured out the code. All those letters we got from the Atarefaunet band...I know what they mean.${prompt};If he had made some sort of deal with the brigands, you would think they would get together somewhere first, then head off to get the treasure.${prompt}
When I rrrearranged the order of the letters, I came out with “Tavnazia.”${prompt};Vauderame is a man of many secrets.${prompt}
Tavnazia...;Nobody really knows his background, and he loses us every time we try to tail him. There's something dangerous about that man.${prompt}
In other words, the Tavnazian Marquisate. A nation to the west that was obliterated by the beastmen in the Great War.${prompt};...Hmm.
Tavnazia pledged allegiance to San d'Oria and was ruled by Marquis Altedour. But after some investigation, I discovered some slightly more interesting facts.${prompt};A very mysterious character, indeed. Speaking of mysteries, there's one thing that I don't quite understand.${prompt}
Just before the nation was swarmed under by the beastmen, the knights of Tavnazia carried away the rrroyal treasure. However, the knights themselves were attacked by brigands and the treasure was stolen.${prompt};Why did the brigands send the word “Tavnazia” to Vauderame?${prompt}
If you listen to the old thieves, they'll tell you it was the work of the Atarefaunet band. But since the leader of the band died, the truth is anybody's guess.${prompt};Surely he would have already known about the Tavnazian royal treasure before planning to meet with them.${prompt}
Isn't this exciting?;...That's it!${prompt}
The rrremaining members of the Atarefaunet band must hold the key to the location of the Tavnazian royal treasure!${prompt};${name-player},
Vauderame of the Tenshodo must be arranging a deal with them to get his greedy hands on the goods.${prompt};I want you to go and ask these two thieves a question.${prompt}
Now that I know his plans, I'll have to work my way into his circle and get my paws in the pie, too.${prompt};The person who wrote the papers from the Tenshodo, the name at the top...what was wrrritten there?${prompt}
Don't rrrush into anything just yet. There's something wrong. Vauderame hasn't made a move yet.${prompt};Quickly now! There's no time!${prompt}
If he had made some sort of deal with the brigands, you would think they would get together somewhere first, then head off to get the treasure.${prompt};We'll deal with the rest, so hurry! Be on your way!${prompt}
Vauderame is a man of many secrets.${prompt};A nation with allegiance to San d'Oria, ruled by Marquis Altedour... It's supposed to lie farrr to the west of here...${prompt}
Nobody really knows his background, and he loses us every time we try to tail him. There's something dangerous about that man.${prompt};Anyway, let's put the geography lesson aside and go pull the rrrug out from under the Tenshodo! Things have started to get interesting...${prompt}
...Hmm.;Vauderame is a very mysterrrious character. He's been in the Tenshodo for ten years, quietly building up his current standing.${prompt}
A very mysterious character, indeed. Speaking of mysteries, there's one thing that I don't quite understand.${prompt};I get the sense that he's made a deliberrrate effort to rrreach a position that allows him to move freely while keeping a low profile.${prompt}
Why did the brigands send the word “Tavnazia” to Vauderame?${prompt};Did you get the information I asked for?
Surely he would have already known about the Tavnazian royal treasure before planning to meet with them.${prompt};Okay, let's put it all together and see what we have.${prompt}
...That's it!${prompt};You've probably already noticed, but the name of the person who wrrrote the papers is different on each one. However, the contents are all exactly the same. A little odd, don't you think?${prompt}

The effects of controlling regions.;Nous attendons de vous que vous fassiez de votre mieux pour servir votre pays.${prompt}
Regions controlled by other nations.;"Vous pouvez voir l'état actuel des conquêtes en sélectionnant ""Info Région"" dans le menu principal."
Regions under beastman control.${prompt};Les résultats des conquêtes dans toutes les régions sont régulièrement recalculés, donc vous voudrez peut-être les vérifier de temps en temps.${prompt}
All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call “conquests.” You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.${prompt};Les magasins de notre ville vendront des articles différents en fonction de notre rang de conquête.
Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.${prompt};La Troupe Valeriano visitera également la nation qui termine première et apportera un peu de joie à ses citoyens.${prompt}
Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.${prompt};Vous pouvez faire don de cristaux à votre nation une fois que vous atteignez le rang 2.
So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.${prompt};Il vous suffit de les échanger avec des gardes comme moi, et nous veillerons à ce qu'ils soient envoyés à la bonne adresse.${prompt}
Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control.;Nous aimerions que vous fassiez des dons de cristaux à votre nation à partir de maintenant.
They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.${prompt};Il vous suffit de les échanger avec des gardes comme moi, et nous veillerons à ce qu'ils soient envoyés à la bonne adresse.${prompt}
Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.${prompt};Vous pouvez acquérir des cristaux en vainquant des ennemis tant que vous avez le Sceau de votre nation.
Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.${prompt};Avoir le Sceau appliqué sur vous est également le seul moyen de participer aux conquêtes.${prompt}
So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike.;Des points de rang vous seront attribués pour chaque cristal que vous donnez, et vous pourriez vous voir offrir de nouvelles missions à mesure que votre rang augmente.${prompt}
We expect you to do your best to serve your country.${prompt};Vous recevez également des points de rang pour avoir accompli des missions.
You can see the current state of conquests by selecting “Region Info” from the main menu.;Accomplissez des missions et participez aux conquêtes pour augmenter votre rang et servir votre pays.${prompt}
Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.${prompt};Vous recevez des points de conquête lorsque vous vainquez des monstres tout en participant aux conquêtes.
Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank.;"Sélectionnez ""Info Région"" dans le menu pour vérifier votre nombre actuel de points de conquête.${prompt}"

You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2.;Lorsque les résultats des conquêtes sont annoncés, vous saurez quel pays contrôle la région dans laquelle vous vous trouvez à ce moment-là. Parfois, les régions peuvent devenir neutres, ou même les bêtes peuvent prendre le contrôle des régions.${prompt}
Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt};Si nous prenons le contrôle d'une région, des gardes-frontières y seront placés pour aider des aventuriers comme vous.${prompt}
We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on.;Des marchands y seront également placés, et les biens de cette région trouveront leur chemin vers les magasins locaux ici.${prompt}
Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.${prompt};Prendre le contrôle des régions est le principe de base des conquêtes. Nous avons besoin que chacun de vous fasse de son mieux et porte notre nation au sommet des classements.${prompt}
You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet.;Bien sûr, parfois nous perdons des régions face à d'autres nations... donc nous devons essayer de les reprendre avant que les prochains résultats des conquêtes soient annoncés.${prompt}
Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.${prompt};En guise d'incitation, nous vous attribuerons plus de points de conquête pour avoir vaincu des monstres dans ces régions.${prompt}
Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.${prompt};Mais si nous sommes alliés avec une autre nation, vous ne recevrez que le taux régulier pour avoir vaincu des monstres dans les régions de nos alliés. En revanche, nous vous attribuerons plus de points pour combattre dans les régions de la nation classée en tête.${prompt}
You also receive rank points for completing missions.;Notre préoccupation principale réside dans le fait que les bêtes prennent le contrôle de nos régions.
Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.${prompt};Si trop d'entre nous sont vaincus dans une région, les bêtes en prendront le contrôle.${prompt}
You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests.;Si cela se produit, non seulement c'est un coup dur pour notre fierté, mais vous ne pourrez pas acquérir de cristaux dans cette région.${prompt}
"Select ""Region Info"" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.${prompt}";Les bêtes sont une menace pour toutes les nations. S'ils prennent le pouvoir, nous devons tous nous unir et chasser ces créatures viles de cette région.${prompt}
You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.${prompt};Nous avons besoin que vous apportiez des fournitures aux gardes-frontières postés dans les régions sous notre contrôle.${prompt}
When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.${prompt};"Il y a un poste frontière dans chaque région. Sélectionnez ""Info Région"" dans le menu, et recherchez les zones avec un petit drapeau sur la carte. C'est là qu'ils se trouvent.${prompt}"
If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.${prompt};Voici les fournitures. Il vous suffit de les remettre au garde du poste frontière et votre mission sera accomplie.
Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.${prompt};Maintenant, choisissez à quel poste vous souhaitez aller. Nous offrons des récompenses différentes pour chaque région, alors choisissez avec soin.${prompt}
Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.${prompt};Où souhaitez-vous apporter les fournitures ?
Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.${prompt};${selection-lines}

Upon hearing this, the Mithran Tracker immediately set off on her way. I wish for you to also travel to Mhaura and meet with this perrrson.${prompt};There, we found ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Piecing togetherrr everything I have heard, I believe it must belong to the sinner's daughter.${prompt}
You have your task.;However, one problem rrremains.
The blessing of the winds upon you.${prompt};Where is the other half of the stone?
I have learned that one who knows of the fate of the sinner's daughter can be found in the Blacksmiths' Guild of Mhaura.${prompt};Where is the grrrave of the mother?${prompt}
Upon hearing this, the Mithran Tracker immediately set off on her way. I wish for you to also travel to Mhaura and meet with this perrrson.${prompt};We were unable to discover the mother's body.${prompt}
Twenty years prrrevious, there was a sinner who escaped from her prrrison and fled to this continent.${prompt};Since she was held captive in the prison of Castle Oztroja, her rrremains should lie there still.${prompt}
There are few Mithra in Windurst who know of her tale. It is a low point in our historrry, and not a thing that is often spoke of...${prompt};It is said that the King of Oztroja forces prrrisoners to fight his Yagudo in a hall on the highest level of the castle. The bodies of the fallen are then supposedly thrrrown into a large pond.${prompt}
There is little point in asking those of us who rrremember. We do not talk about it willingly.${prompt};If you search the pond thorrroughly, you may find what you are looking for...${prompt}
We are of the trrribe to the south. The events that trrranspired among us at that time are taboo. That is all I can tell you.${prompt};Well, I will leave this task to you. Rrreturn here as soon as you find the ${item-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt}
You have rrreturned.;I must apologize, adventurer.
...And the Mithran Tracker with you.${prompt};I would like to send a parrrty of warriors to aid you, but we do not have permission from Tour des Cieux to enter Castle Oztroja.${prompt}
After learning the location of the daughter's final rrresting place, we trrraveled to a place known as the Eldieme Necropolis.${prompt};The blessing of the earth upon you.${prompt}
There, we found ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Piecing togetherrr everything I have heard, I believe it must belong to the sinner's daughter.${prompt};In the time of the Great War, the warriors held in Oztroja were forced to fight with Yagudo in a hall on the castle's highest floor.${prompt}
However, one problem rrremains.;The fallen warriors were then thrrrown into a large pond on the upper levels.${prompt}
Where is the other half of the stone?;I believe the ${item-singular: 2[2]} that fits with the ${item-singular: 1[2]} of Syu Befrathi can be found there... However, the talents of a ranger will be needed to discover it.${prompt}
Where is the grrrave of the mother?${prompt};You found it...
We were unable to discover the mother's body.${prompt};Yes, it's a perrrfect match with Syu Befrathi's ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Since she was held captive in the prison of Castle Oztroja, her rrremains should lie there still.${prompt};I'm impressed.
It is said that the King of Oztroja forces prrrisoners to fight his Yagudo in a hall on the highest level of the castle. The bodies of the fallen are then supposedly thrrrown into a large pond.${prompt};Tales of mighty adventurers are often little more than exaggerated rumor.${prompt}
If you search the pond thorrroughly, you may find what you are looking for...${prompt};However, while this adventurer was perrrforming ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] task, I was busy talking with an important witness.${prompt}
Well, I will leave this task to you. Rrreturn here as soon as you find the ${item-singular: 2[2]}.${prompt};This witness claims that the use of a shining bow was rrresponsible for your loss of sight.${prompt}
I must apologize, adventurer.;The witness also mentioned that the prisoners of Oztroja were saved by a bow that loosed arrows of light so dazzling, the Yagudo were struck blind. This could only describe the Bow of Light.${prompt}
I would like to send a parrrty of warriors to aid you, but we do not have permission from Heavens Tower to enter Castle Oztroja.${prompt};It is time for the truth to be known. You are concealing the Bow of Light, aren't you? Have you been seduced by its powerrr, Perih Vashai?${prompt}
The blessing of the earth upon you.${prompt};Even for one who is blind, surely you can see this has gone on long enough!${prompt}
In the time of the Great War, the warriors held in Oztroja were forced to fight with Yagudo in a hall on the castle's highest floor.${prompt};......${prompt}
The fallen warriors were then thrrrown into a large pond on the upper levels.${prompt};Very well.
I believe the ${item-singular: 2[2]} that fits with the ${item-singular: 1[2]} of Syu Befrathi can be found there... However, the talents of a ranger will be needed to discover it.${prompt};It is said that you are not one to run and hide.${prompt}
You found it...;I am in no hurry. Let us leave it at this for now.${prompt}
Yes, it's a perrrfect match with Syu Befrathi's ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};And this, adventurer, I give to you. May you always be on the side of justice.${prompt}
I'm impressed.;...The Bow of Light.
Tales of mighty adventurers are often little more than exaggerated rumor.${prompt};Thirty years have passed since its creation. And all it has brought us is death and misfortune.${prompt}
However, while this adventurer was perrrforming ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] task, I was busy talking with an important witness.${prompt};This all started when we came to this continent. The elders called this place the Forbidden Land, and were opposed to the crossing. It all started here...${prompt}
This witness claims that the use of a shining bow was rrresponsible for your loss of sight.${prompt};We Mithra receive the blessing of the earth in creating the chieftainness's bow.${prompt}
The witness also mentioned that the prisoners of Oztroja were saved by a bow that loosed arrows of light so dazzling, the Yagudo were struck blind. This could only describe the Bow of Light.${prompt};Chieftainness Perih Vashai received the blessing of this land when she made the Azure Bow.${prompt}
It is time for the truth to be known. You are concealing the Bow of Light, aren't you? Have you been seduced by its powerrr, Perih Vashai?${prompt};The Bow of Light belongs to the Fire Tribe of the south. The arrows fired from that bow are said to be so powerrrful and so destrrructive, no enemy can stand before them.${prompt}
Even for one who is blind, surely you can see this has gone on long enough!${prompt};But no matter how powerrrful a weapon is, our chieftainness would not take up that bow. Its use would contrrradict the code of the ranger.${prompt}
......${prompt};...?
Very well.;The one who follows you here...${prompt}
It is said that you are not one to run and hide.${prompt};Perih Vashai.
I am in no hurry. Let us leave it at this for now.${prompt};There is something I wish to ask you. Please give me an answer.${prompt}
And this, adventurer, I give to you. May you always be on the side of justice.${prompt};...And what might that be, Semih Lafihna? You wish to ask me about the lost Bow of Light?${prompt}
...The Bow of Light.;No, not that. It's about my past...${prompt}
Thirty years have passed since its creation. And all it has brought us is death and misfortune.${prompt};I rrrealized something with all this talk of the Bow of Light. The Sibyl Guards, every one of us, were prisoners in Oztroja twenty years ago.${prompt}
This all started when we came to this continent. The elders called this place the Forbidden Land, and were opposed to the crossing. It all started here...${prompt};I listened to everyone's stories, and they all have memories of being saved by that bow. But for some reason, I have no recollection of it...${prompt}
We Mithra receive the blessing of the earth in creating the chieftainness's bow.${prompt};I was one of those prisoners as well, wasn't I? I was taken in by Tour des Cieux to keep the secrets of the Bow of Light hidden from the world.${prompt}
Chieftainness Perih Vashai received the blessing of this land when she made the Azure Bow.${prompt};Or was there some other reason that only affected me? I don't know how you managed to erase the scent of sin from me, but I must be the sinner's...${prompt}
The Bow of Light belongs to the Fire Tribe of the south. The arrows fired from that bow are said to be so powerrrful and so destrrructive, no enemy can stand before them.${prompt};Semih Lafihna, I swear on the Azure Bow. You are not the sinner's daughter.${prompt}
But no matter how powerrrful a weapon is, our chieftainness would not take up that bow. Its use would contrrradict the code of the ranger.${prompt};Then why?
...?;The Mithran Tracker assured me there was no record of my parents. And there's one thing I dimly rrrecall...${prompt}
The one who follows you here...${prompt};At the time of the Great War, I rrremember my ${item-singular: 1[2]} was switched with another. My past...why...?${prompt}
Perih Vashai.;Why doesn't anybody know about my past?${prompt}
There is something I wish to ask you. Please give me an answer.${prompt};I meant to tell you after all this was over, but I see I have no choice.${prompt}
...And what might that be, Semih Lafihna? You wish to ask me about the lost Bow of Light?${prompt};Go to Mhaura and meet with Koh Lenbalalako.${prompt}
No, not that. It's about my past...${prompt};If you take the ${item-singular: 1[2]} I entrrrusted to this adventurer, she will talk with you.${prompt}
I rrrealized something with all this talk of the Bow of Light. The Sibyl Guards, every one of us, were prisoners in Oztroja twenty years ago.${prompt};Once Semih Lafihna meets with Koh Lenbalalako of Mhaura, she will understand.${prompt}
I listened to everyone's stories, and they all have memories of being saved by that bow. But for some reason, I have no recollection of it...${prompt};I would like you to follow her to Mhaura. She will need your strrrength to help bring an end to this tale.${prompt}
I was one of those prisoners as well, wasn't I? I was taken in by Heavens Tower to keep the secrets of the Bow of Light hidden from the world.${prompt};The chieftainness wishes Semih Lafihna to see the trrruth with her own eyes.${prompt}
Or was there some other reason that only affected me? I don't know how you managed to erase the scent of sin from me, but I must be the sinner's...${prompt};Everything becomes clear when you choose to see of your own free will. “Will” represents the eye of the spirit. As a ranger, the vision of your spirit must not become clouded...${prompt}
Semih Lafihna, I swear on the Azure Bow. You are not the sinner's daughter.${prompt};The Mithran Tracker is unwavering in her search for the Bow of Light.${prompt}
Then why?;But, no matter how she tries to sway us, we will not betrrray our chieftainness. We have sworn to obey the chieftainness in all things.${prompt}
The Mithran Tracker assured me there was no record of my parents. And there's one thing I dimly rrrecall...${prompt};So, you will follow Semih and trrravel to the Northland?${prompt}
At the time of the Great War, I rrremember my ${item-singular: 1[2]} was switched with another. My past...why...?${prompt};The Northlands are a place of death that we Mithra avoid above all others. It is a land that rrrobs us of the blessing and grace of nature. May the winds watch over you.${prompt}
Why doesn't anybody know about my past?${prompt};I now have the Bow of Light in my possession. The magicite that gave this bow its cursed power has been rrreturned to the land where it belongs.${prompt}
I meant to tell you after all this was over, but I see I have no choice.${prompt};I wish to express my heartfelt grrratitude to you, Semih Lafihna, for rrretrieving it from the wilds of the Northlands.${prompt}
Go to Mhaura and meet with Koh Lenbalalako.${prompt};It was not I who found the bow. That honor belongs to the adventurer ${name-player}.${prompt}
If you take the ${item-singular: 1[2]} I entrrrusted to this adventurer, she will talk with you.${prompt};I see. I have much to thank you for.${prompt}
Once Semih Lafihna meets with Koh Lenbalalako of Mhaura, she will understand.${prompt};Ah, but words of thanks have little value to an adventurer, do they? Instead, I will give you these.${prompt}
I would like you to follow her to Mhaura. She will need your strrrength to help bring an end to this tale.${prompt};It is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.
The chieftainness wishes Semih Lafihna to see the trrruth with her own eyes.${prompt};Please take them as a symbol of my rrrespect for your skill as a ranger.${prompt}
Everything becomes clear when you choose to see of your own free will. “Will” represents the eye of the spirit. As a ranger, the vision of your spirit must not become clouded...${prompt};And so, Chieftainness Perih Vashai, I leave this land behind me to begin my next hunt.${prompt}
The Mithran Tracker is unwavering in her search for the Bow of Light.${prompt};...And just like that, she leaves...${prompt}
But, no matter how she tries to sway us, we will not betrrray our chieftainness. We have sworn to obey the chieftainness in all things.${prompt};...Hmmm, the Tracker's real task here was most likely the destruction of the Bow of Light.${prompt}
So, you will follow Semih and trrravel to the Northland?${prompt};And not catching the sinner?${prompt}
The Northlands are a place of death that we Mithra avoid above all others. It is a land that rrrobs us of the blessing and grace of nature. May the winds watch over you.${prompt};I don't know for certain, but the homeland was definitely more concerned with the Bow of Light than the sinner's daughter.${prompt}
I now have the Bow of Light in my possession. The magicite that gave this bow its cursed power has been rrreturned to the land where it belongs.${prompt};In that case, the magicite's power must truly be dreadful.${prompt}
I wish to express my heartfelt grrratitude to you, Semih Lafihna, for rrretrieving it from the wilds of the Northlands.${prompt};......
It was not I who found the bow. That honor belongs to the adventurer ${name-player}.${prompt};Magicite rrresembles crystals. Or rather, the power contained in magicite is similar to, or perhaps greater than, that contained in crystals.${prompt}
I see. I have much to thank you for.${prompt};But both are unnatural creations. The powerrr of magicite is an ominous, cursed energy. It is a manifestation of evil that we cannot tolerrrate.${prompt}
Ah, but words of thanks have little value to an adventurer, do they? Instead, I will give you these.${prompt};The Chieftainness of the Fire Tribe, Nhev Befrathi, knew this. And after seeing the bow for ourselves, the Mithran Tracker and I knew it too.${prompt}
It is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.;That crystal calls to those of Mithran blood. It awakens feelings of envy, of jealousy. It darkens the nature of the heart.${prompt}
Please take them as a symbol of my rrrespect for your skill as a ranger.${prompt};Nhev Befrathi and her daughter, however, had the strength to rrresist its influence. Even though they used the bow, the light in their hearts rrremained.${prompt}
And so, Chieftainness Perih Vashai, I leave this land behind me to begin my next hunt.${prompt};...I understand now.
...And just like that, she leaves...${prompt};Perih Vashai, you lost the light when you drew back the string of that cursed weapon.${prompt}
...Hmmm, the Tracker's real task here was most likely the destruction of the Bow of Light.${prompt};Yes. I saw the power of that bow and closed my eyes to it.${prompt}
And not catching the sinner?${prompt};You desire nothing in a world where you see nothing. There is nothing to be afraid of.${prompt}
I don't know for certain, but the homeland was definitely more concerned with the Bow of Light than the sinner's daughter.${prompt};......
In that case, the magicite's power must truly be dreadful.${prompt};I rrrespect you, Perih Vashai. I don't know if I could have done the same in your place.${prompt}
......;But for that, I twisted the path you were to walk. To save Syu Befrathi, I erased the existence of my own daughter...${prompt}
Magicite rrresembles crystals. Or rather, the power contained in magicite is similar to, or perhaps greater than, that contained in crystals.${prompt};......${prompt}
But both are unnatural creations. The powerrr of magicite is an ominous, cursed energy. It is a manifestation of evil that we cannot tolerrrate.${prompt};...Perih Vashai.
The Chieftainness of the Fire Tribe, Nhev Befrathi, knew this. And after seeing the bow for ourselves, the Mithran Tracker and I knew it too.${prompt};I have no feelings of hate towards you. It is my duty to listen to the voice of naturrre.${prompt}
That crystal calls to those of Mithran blood. It awakens feelings of envy, of jealousy. It darkens the nature of the heart.${prompt};I will come to see you again.
Nhev Befrathi and her daughter, however, had the strength to rrresist its influence. Even though they used the bow, the light in their hearts rrremained.${prompt};Until then, may the wind guide your footsteps.
...I understand now.;Occasionally, you too should try seeing the world through closed eyes.${prompt}
Perih Vashai, you lost the light when you drew back the string of that cursed weapon.${prompt};What is there, in your inner world? ...Who do you see?${prompt}
Yes. I saw the power of that bow and closed my eyes to it.${prompt};All of the children taken in by Tour des Cieux lost their mothers. Under normal circumstances, they would be sent to our homeland to be cared for by other Mithra.${prompt}
You desire nothing in a world where you see nothing. There is nothing to be afraid of.${prompt};You rrrealize why they were not sent to the homeland, don't you? The chieftainness wished to watch over the growth of her child, Semih Lafihna...Even if it meant being despised...${prompt}
......;We know what the chieftainness felt when she gave up her child for the sake of rrreturning the Bow of Light to its rrrightful place.${prompt}
I rrrespect you, Perih Vashai. I don't know if I could have done the same in your place.${prompt};She had to abandon her rrrole as a mother in order to fulfil her duties as a chieftainness, and as a ranger. I wonder if Semih Lafihna understands this?${prompt}
But for that, I twisted the path you were to walk. To save Syu Befrathi, I erased the existence of my own daughter...${prompt};Ho there, adventurer.
......${prompt};Have you come to take on the search for the ${item-plural: 1[2]}?${prompt}
...Perih Vashai.;There's actually no longer a need for it... But we should honor the brave warriors who brought about this time of peace.${prompt}
I have no feelings of hate towards you. It is my duty to listen to the voice of naturrre.${prompt};Well, if you find any, bring them here the same as usual.${prompt}
I will come to see you again.;Ah, you've arrived.
Until then, may the wind guide your footsteps.;With your help, Semih Lafihna has become a little more rrreceptive to the words of the chieftainness.${prompt}
Occasionally, you too should try seeing the world through closed eyes.${prompt};Now we have some peace around here. Especially since the Mithran Tracker has returned home convinced of the fate of the sinner's daughter.${prompt}
What is there, in your inner world? ...Who do you see?${prompt};Hmmm? You also went to Eldieme Necropolis to confirm her death?${prompt}
All of the children taken in by Heavens Tower lost their mothers. Under normal circumstances, they would be sent to our homeland to be cared for by other Mithra.${prompt};Heh-heh-heh.
You rrrealize why they were not sent to the homeland, don't you? The chieftainness wished to watch over the growth of her child, Semih Lafihna...Even if it meant being despised...${prompt};That wasn't the rrremains of the daughter. It was the final rrresting place of her mother, Nhev Befrathi.${prompt}
We know what the chieftainness felt when she gave up her child for the sake of rrreturning the Bow of Light to its rrrightful place.${prompt};We had another adventurer like you find a set of ownerless-earrings. We placed them in the necropolis long before you got there.${prompt}
She had to abandon her rrrole as a mother in order to fulfil her duties as a chieftainness, and as a ranger. I wonder if Semih Lafihna understands this?${prompt};Chieftainness Perih Vashai had predicted that another Mithran Tracker would show up eventually.${prompt}
Ho there, adventurer.;But if you do happen to find any ${item-plural: 1[2]} in the Meriphataud Mountains, bring them here. I'll buy them from you.${prompt}
Have you come to take on the search for the ${item-plural: 1[2]}?${prompt};They belonged to the Mithran warriors responsible for bringing about this time of peace. They should be properly honored.${prompt}
There's actually no longer a need for it... But we should honor the brave warriors who brought about this time of peace.${prompt};If you ever find any ${item-plural: 1[2]} in the Meriphataud Mountains, bring them back here. I will buy them from you to honor the fallen.${prompt}
Well, if you find any, bring them here the same as usual.${prompt};We found many earrings but had a terrible time trying to find the missing halves...I thought furrr was going to fly.${prompt}
Ah, you've arrived.;I wonder if the Mithran Tracker really believes that the daughter is dead... We can't let our guarrrd down yet.${prompt}
With your help, Semih Lafihna has become a little more rrreceptive to the words of the chieftainness.${prompt};You found some?
Now we have some peace around here. Especially since the Mithran Tracker has returned home convinced of the fate of the sinner's daughter.${prompt};Here, take this with my thanks.${prompt}
Hmmm? You also went to Eldieme Necropolis to confirm her death?${prompt};Hello, adventurer.
Heh-heh-heh.;If you find any ${item-plural: 1[2]}, bring them here to me.${prompt}
That wasn't the rrremains of the daughter. It was the final rrresting place of her mother, Nhev Befrathi.${prompt};Let us honor the Mithran warriors who fell in the Meriphataud Mountains.${prompt}
We had another adventurer like you find a set of ownerless-earrings. We placed them in the necropolis long before you got there.${prompt};Captain Rakoh Buuma was sooo angrrry, y'know? She was saying something like, “Lately the guards of Windurst Woods have rrreally been slacking off! Slacking off completely!”...I think.${prompt}
Chieftainness Perih Vashai had predicted that another Mithran Tracker would show up eventually.${prompt};Now that the airship route to the southern continent has been reopened, there might be some trrrouble amongst the Mithra of Windurst...I think.
But if you do happen to find any ${item-plural: 1[2]} in the Meriphataud Mountains, bring them here. I'll buy them from you.${prompt};...Gotta stay alert, y'know?${prompt}
They belonged to the Mithran warriors responsible for bringing about this time of peace. They should be properly honored.${prompt};Captain Rakoh Buuma has been fuming that the guards of Windurst Woods have “rrreally been slacking off, slacking off completely”!${prompt}
If you ever find any ${item-plural: 1[2]} in the Meriphataud Mountains, bring them back here. I will buy them from you to honor the fallen.${prompt};I wonderrr if she found out about me fishing during patrol duty? I'm not gonna fish anymorrre! I'm gonna do my job properly!${prompt}
We found many earrings but had a terrible time trying to find the missing halves...I thought furrr was going to fly.${prompt};W-we were r-reprimanded by Captain Rakoh Buuma. She was growling that we guards of Windurst Woods have rrreally been slacking off... “Slacking off completely,” she said!${prompt}
I wonder if the Mithran Tracker really believes that the daughter is dead... We can't let our guarrrd down yet.${prompt};I, erm, I think she was angry b-because I, I don'taru get along with Mithra very well...
You found some?;M-maybe I sh-should try to invite Sola Jaab along on a fishing trip s-sometime.${prompt}
Here, take this with my thanks.${prompt};Ajido-Marujido...
Hello, adventurer.;Minister of the Orastery and head of the Mage Academy. This mission has been issued by him.${prompt}
If you find any ${item-plural: 1[2]}, bring them here to me.${prompt};It says here that you should head to the Orastery right away. There's nothing written about the nature of the mission, but...it's a direct order from the ministerrr. You should hurry along.${prompt}
Let us honor the Mithran warriors who fell in the Meriphataud Mountains.${prompt};...This is a mission ordered by Ajido-Marujido, head of the Mage Academy. He wants you to head to the Orastery rrright away.${prompt}
Captain Rakoh Buuma was sooo angrrry, y'know? She was saying something like, “Lately the guards of Windurst Woods have rrreally been slacking off! Slacking off completely!”...I think.${prompt};The mission parameters are strictly confidential... I wonder what he'll ask of you?${prompt}
Now that the airship route to the southern continent has been reopened, there might be some trrrouble amongst the Mithra of Windurst...I think.;Where did she hear about it, I wonder...?
...Gotta stay alert, y'know?${prompt};Semih Lafihna, she like, totally wanted to know everything about this mission from Ajido-Marujido.${prompt}
Captain Rakoh Buuma has been fuming that the guards of Windurst Woods have “rrreally been slacking off, slacking off completely”!${prompt};She seemed kinda on edge, y'know?
I wonderrr if she found out about me fishing during patrol duty? I'm not gonna fish anymorrre! I'm gonna do my job properly!${prompt};Even Captain Buuma, who like, totally hates Semih, was like, “Oh, okay, this is what the mission is about,”...or something like that.${prompt}
W-we were r-reprimanded by Captain Rakoh Buuma. She was growling that we guards of Windurst Woods have rrreally been slacking off... “Slacking off completely,” she said!${prompt};Things are so easygoing herrre lately.
I, erm, I think she was angry b-because I, I don'taru get along with Mithra very well...;It's nice to have some peace in Windurst for a change.${prompt}
M-maybe I sh-should try to invite Sola Jaab along on a fishing trip s-sometime.${prompt};Up until now there have been so many heart-stopping incidents. Farrr too many. We should try and preserve this peace for a while.${prompt}
Ajido-Marujido...;S-speaking of Minister Ajido-Marujido, I, I heard Minister Tosuka-Porika of the Optistery c-calling him a thiefy-wief.${prompt}
Minister of the Orastery and head of the Mage Academy. This mission has been issued by him.${prompt};I, I mean, they've never been the besty-westy of friends, but I w-wonder what else could have h-happened?
It says here that you should head to the Orastery right away. There's nothing written about the nature of the mission, but...it's a direct order from the ministerrr. You should hurry along.${prompt};It gives me b-butterflies in my tummy-wummy.${prompt}
...This is a mission ordered by Ajido-Marujido, head of the Mage Academy. He wants you to head to the Orastery rrright away.${prompt};......
The mission parameters are strictly confidential... I wonder what he'll ask of you?${prompt};I mustaru help my brother...!
Where did she hear about it, I wonder...?;I havetaru be strong...!${prompt}
Semih Lafihna, she like, totally wanted to know everything about this mission from Ajido-Marujido.${prompt};You have been summoned to Tour des Cieux by order of the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
She seemed kinda on edge, y'know?;Could this be rrrelated to the arrest of Minister Ajido-Marujido by the Sibyl Guards? You will probably be interrogated on the details of your previous mission. Make haste to Tour des Cieux.${prompt}
Even Captain Buuma, who like, totally hates Semih, was like, “Oh, okay, this is what the mission is about,”...or something like that.${prompt};You have been summoned to Tour des Cieux by order of the Star Sibyl.${prompt}
Things are so easygoing herrre lately.;...Ah yes, if you happen to meet with Semih Lafihna, tell her this: No matter what the Star Sibyl says, we Mithra will follow the path of our beliefs.${prompt}
It's nice to have some peace in Windurst for a change.${prompt};The D-Dark D-Dungeon is the w-worst punishment that a criminal can g-getaru.${prompt}
Up until now there have been so many heart-stopping incidents. Farrr too many. We should try and preserve this peace for a while.${prompt};There's n-no leaving the Dark Dungeon until you d-die. H-h-h-how h-h-h-horrible!${prompt}
S-speaking of Minister Ajido-Marujido, I, I heard Minister Tosuka-Porika of the Optistery c-calling him a thiefy-wief.${prompt};What an uproarrr!
I, I mean, they've never been the besty-westy of friends, but I w-wonder what else could have h-happened?;There's been anotherrr incident!${prompt}
It gives me b-butterflies in my tummy-wummy.${prompt};...But being a Tarutaru problem, it's probably nothing to get worked up about. He'll just get a slap on the wrist and a week in jail or something similarrr, I would think.${prompt}
......;I always thought Tour des Cieux just did, y'know, prophecies and stuff. But the Star Sibyl rrreally, like, lays down the law when she has to.${prompt}
I mustaru help my brother...!;What did the Orastery minister get up to, anyway? I mean, what's under that crumbly old tower, like, y'know?${prompt}
I havetaru be strong...!${prompt};Now that the Sibyl Guards are checking all the missions, it really gets my hackles up.${prompt}
You have been summoned to Heavens Tower by order of the Star Sibyl.${prompt};Well, leaving all that aside, your next mission comes from the Optistery. They are rrrequesting assistance with tidying up the book vault.${prompt}
Could this be rrrelated to the arrest of Minister Ajido-Marujido by the Sibyl Guards? You will probably be interrogated on the details of your previous mission. Make haste to Heavens Tower.${prompt};The Optistery must have been happy with your past performance to ask for you by name.${prompt}
You have been summoned to Heavens Tower by order of the Star Sibyl.${prompt};Go to the Optistery and talk to the minister for the details of your mission.${prompt}
...Ah yes, if you happen to meet with Semih Lafihna, tell her this: No matter what the Star Sibyl says, we Mithra will follow the path of our beliefs.${prompt};...Oh, it's a little late, but...
The D-Dark D-Dungeon is the w-worst punishment that a criminal can g-getaru.${prompt};Congratulations on rrreaching rrrank seven.${prompt}
There's n-no leaving the Dark Dungeon until you d-die. H-h-h-how h-h-h-horrible!${prompt};I, I, I don't like to talk aboutaru people this way, b-b-but please take c-c-care around the Sibyl Guards.${prompt}
What an uproarrr!;I, I, I think they're k-k-k-eeping a close eye on y-y-you.
There's been anotherrr incident!${prompt};W-w-watch your back on the streets at n-n-night...${prompt}
...But being a Tarutaru problem, it's probably nothing to get worked up about. He'll just get a slap on the wrist and a week in jail or something similarrr, I would think.${prompt};I despise cleaning, but I love those frog books.${prompt}
I always thought Heavens Tower just did, y'know, prophecies and stuff. But the Star Sibyl rrreally, like, lays down the law when she has to.${prompt};If I were a rank seven adventurerrr being offered this mission... Rrr, what a dilemma!${prompt}
What did the Orastery minister get up to, anyway? I mean, what's under that crumbly old tower, like, y'know?${prompt};You know the Minister of the Manustery...Miss Apururu? She doesn't like, y'know, smile as much as she used to.${prompt}
Now that the Sibyl Guards are checking all the missions, it really gets my hackles up.${prompt};Even when she does smile, it's like, not rrreally a smile, y'know? I'm a girrrl, too. I know these things... I think.${prompt}
Well, leaving all that aside, your next mission comes from the Optistery. They are rrrequesting assistance with tidying up the book vault.${prompt};This is a mission issued by the Rrrhinostery.${prompt}
The Optistery must have been happy with your past performance to ask for you by name.${prompt};The Rrrhinostery wishes your help in a certain matter. Speak with the rrresearcher Leepe-Hoppe for the full details. He can be found on the second floor of the Rrrhinostery.${prompt}
Go to the Optistery and talk to the minister for the details of your mission.${prompt};I have a feeling something bad has happened. I hope you're able to straighten things out for them.${prompt}
...Oh, it's a little late, but...;This mission entails helping out the Rrrhinostery. Speak with the rrresearcher Leepe-Hoppe for the full details. He can be found on the second floor of the Rrrhinostery.${prompt}
Congratulations on rrreaching rrrank seven.${prompt};The Sibyl Guards had nothing to say about this mission. Does this mean the Rrrhinostery is considered above suspicion? Or does it mean that something more sinister already has their full attention?${prompt}
I, I, I don't like to talk aboutaru people this way, b-b-but please take c-c-care around the Sibyl Guards.${prompt};I, I, I've heard that Minister R-R-Rukususu of the R-R-Rhinostery is investigating a-a-ancient ruins in the Northlands.${prompt}
I, I, I think they're k-k-k-eeping a close eye on y-y-you.;S-S-She is looking into things like, erm...the reason why the Northlands have towers similar to the ones found in S-S-Sarutabaruta. Wh-wh-why would that be, I wonder?${prompt}
W-w-watch your back on the streets at n-n-night...${prompt};We Mithra came to Windurst from a village far to the south.${prompt}
I despise cleaning, but I love those frog books.${prompt};...I don't really rememberrr much about it, though. Just that it was always hot.${prompt}
If I were a rank seven adventurerrr being offered this mission... Rrr, what a dilemma!${prompt};Have you ever been to the southern continent?
You know the Minister of the Manustery...Miss Apururu? She doesn't like, y'know, smile as much as she used to.${prompt};There are lots of, like, rrreally rrrare plants and stuff... I think.${prompt}
Even when she does smile, it's like, not rrreally a smile, y'know? I'm a girrrl, too. I know these things... I think.${prompt};We use those plants to make, y'know, medicine and weapons and stuff like that.
This is a mission issued by the Rrrhinostery.${prompt};We Mithra are, like, children of nature, y'know?${prompt}
The Rrrhinostery wishes your help in a certain matter. Speak with the rrresearcher Leepe-Hoppe for the full details. He can be found on the second floor of the Rrrhinostery.${prompt};Before I explain your mission, I wish to congratulate you.${prompt}
I have a feeling something bad has happened. I hope you're able to straighten things out for them.${prompt};Well done on rrreaching rrrank eight.
This mission entails helping out the Rrrhinostery. Speak with the rrresearcher Leepe-Hoppe for the full details. He can be found on the second floor of the Rrrhinostery.${prompt};There aren't many people who can make it this far.${prompt}
The Sibyl Guards had nothing to say about this mission. Does this mean the Rrrhinostery is considered above suspicion? Or does it mean that something more sinister already has their full attention?${prompt};Rrright, down to brass tacks.
I, I, I've heard that Minister R-R-Rukususu of the R-R-Rhinostery is investigating a-a-ancient ruins in the Northlands.${prompt};Your next mission is from the Aurastery. You can get the details from the teachers at the School of Magic.${prompt}
S-S-She is looking into things like, erm...the reason why the Northlands have towers similar to the ones found in S-S-Sarutabaruta. Wh-wh-why would that be, I wonder?${prompt};The School of Magic is another name for the Aurastery. The teachers there will explain your mission objectives.${prompt}
We Mithra came to Windurst from a village far to the south.${prompt};Rrrecently, there have been rrrumors of feral Cardians gathering at the magic towers of the Horutoto Ruins. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?${prompt}
...I don't really rememberrr much about it, though. Just that it was always hot.${prompt};D-d-did you know that they h-h-have lots of m-m-magical dolls at the Aurastery?${prompt}
Have you ever been to the southern continent?;O-o-originally there were only a f-f-few types, but Professor Koru-Moru has re-re-remodeled them for various tasks.${prompt}
There are lots of, like, rrreally rrrare plants and stuff... I think.${prompt};Let me see...
We use those plants to make, y'know, medicine and weapons and stuff like that.;...You have ${choice: 1}[50/60/70/80/90/100] points!${prompt}
We Mithra are, like, children of nature, y'know?${prompt};What do I mean, ${choice: 1}[50/60/70/80/90/100] points?
Before I explain your mission, I wish to congratulate you.${prompt};Ah, now that would be telling!${prompt}
Well done on rrreaching rrrank eight.;F...f...froggies!${prompt}
There aren't many people who can make it this far.${prompt};Meow!${prompt}
Rrright, down to brass tacks.;The Principal of the School of Magic is Professor Koru-Moru, y'know? But, like, a few years back, there was a different guy doing the job, y'know?${prompt}
Your next mission is from the Aurastery. You can get the details from the teachers at the School of Magic.${prompt};What's really weird is that you don't hear anything about that guy. Tarutaru are, like, totally into their rumors, so I thought it was kinda strange.${prompt}
The School of Magic is another name for the Aurastery. The teachers there will explain your mission objectives.${prompt};This mission has not been officially approved. However, all of the gatehouse guards have agreed to ask you to perform this task.${prompt}
Rrrecently, there have been rrrumors of feral Cardians gathering at the magic towers of the Horutoto Ruins. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?${prompt};Go to the Manustery and assist Minister Apururu. Those are your orders.${prompt}
D-d-did you know that they h-h-have lots of m-m-magical dolls at the Aurastery?${prompt};I don't think I need to tell you this, but don't tell anyone about this mission. Be especially careful of that Semih Lafihna. She has a habit of picking up on rrrumors from the most unlikely places.${prompt}
O-o-originally there were only a f-f-few types, but Professor Koru-Moru has re-re-remodeled them for various tasks.${prompt};Don't make me rrrepeat myself. Head to the Manustery and talk with Minister Apururu. This is your mission.${prompt}
Let me see...;Keep your orders to yourself, and be especially careful that Semih Lafihna doesn't get wind of what you're doing.${prompt}
...You have ${choice: 1}[50/60/70/80/90/100] points!${prompt};Th-th-this is not a b-b-betrayal of the S-S-Star Sibyl.${prompt}
What do I mean, ${choice: 1}[50/60/70/80/90/100] points?;W-w-we just want to h-h-help Minister Apururu. The Orastery needs your h-h-help too.${prompt}
Ah, now that would be telling!${prompt};Things are getting exciting now! All the guards arrre in on this secret together!${prompt}
F...f...froggies!${prompt};I can hardly contain myself! But I won't let on to anyone. I'll just flick my tail and keep it in.${prompt}
Meow!${prompt};Miiri-Wohri is, like, totally freaked about this mission.${prompt}
The Principal of the School of Magic is Professor Koru-Moru, y'know? But, like, a few years back, there was a different guy doing the job, y'know?${prompt};But even if we, like, y'know, get found out and stuff, they'll just throw us all into the dungeon for a couple of days. It'll be like a sleepover!${prompt}
What's really weird is that you don't hear anything about that guy. Tarutaru are, like, totally into their rumors, so I thought it was kinda strange.${prompt};You have my thanks.
This mission has not been officially approved. However, all of the gatehouse guards have agreed to ask you to perform this task.${prompt};I'm sure you've heard from the guards how terribly-werribly important this mission is to me.${prompt}
Go to the Manustery and assist Minister Apururu. Those are your orders.${prompt};As you know, my brother, Minister Ajido-Marujido, has now spent a considerable amountaru of time in the Dark Dungeon.${prompt}
I don't think I need to tell you this, but don't tell anyone about this mission. Be especially careful of that Semih Lafihna. She has a habit of picking up on rrrumors from the most unlikely places.${prompt};My brother is a very resilient person.
Don't make me rrrepeat myself. Head to the Manustery and talk with Minister Apururu. This is your mission.${prompt};However, the Dark Dungeon is a chamber that drains magical power. To spend this much time in there...${prompt}
Keep your orders to yourself, and be especially careful that Semih Lafihna doesn't get wind of what you're doing.${prompt};I beg of you!
Th-th-this is not a b-b-betrayal of the S-S-Star Sibyl.${prompt};Please help me save him! I know this goes against all the rules, but I have to help my brother!${prompt}
W-w-we just want to h-h-help Minister Apururu. The Orastery needs your h-h-help too.${prompt};Help out?
Things are getting exciting now! All the guards arrre in on this secret together!${prompt};${selection-lines}
I can hardly contain myself! But I won't let on to anyone. I'll just flick my tail and keep it in.${prompt};Leave it to me!
Miiri-Wohri is, like, totally freaked about this mission.${prompt};It's too risky.${prompt}
But even if we, like, y'know, get found out and stuff, they'll just throw us all into the dungeon for a couple of days. It'll be like a sleepover!${prompt};......
You have my thanks.;That's true... But I know you can do it.${prompt}
I'm sure you've heard from the guards how terribly-werribly important this mission is to me.${prompt};...Thank you.
As you know, my brother, Minister Ajido-Marujido, has now spent a considerable amountaru of time in the Dark Dungeon.${prompt};${name-player}...${prompt}
My brother is a very resilient person.;I've been researching a way to save my brother.${prompt}
However, the Dark Dungeon is a chamber that drains magical power. To spend this much time in there...${prompt};The chambers that lie beneath the central tower are sealed with the power of the stars and the moon. This means that the doors to those chambers can only be opened with an item imbued with that same power.${prompt}
I beg of you!;The rings carry-warried by the ministers are such items. Every time a minister is appointed, a ring is made and presented to the new minister by Tour des Cieux.${prompt}
Please help me save him! I know this goes against all the rules, but I have to help my brother!${prompt};After learning this, I took the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} and set off for the Dark Dungeon...${prompt}
Help out?;Give it up, Apururu.
${selection-lines};That seal is beyond you.${prompt}
Leave it to me!;Professor Shantotto...${prompt}
It's too risky.${prompt};I heard you were sneaking around, asking people about the Dark Dungeon.
......;Why don't you just stand at the top of Tour des Cieux and yell, “I'm going to break my brother out of jail. Arrest me, someone!”${prompt}
That's true... But I know you can do it.${prompt};How imprudent.
...Thank you.;And you were always such a bright student.${prompt}
${name-player}...${prompt};I won'taru just stand by and let my brother waste away in there! But I can't...the door won't...${prompt}
I've been researching a way to save my brother.${prompt};I understand how you feel. I don't want to lose him either.
The chambers that lie beneath the central tower are sealed with the power of the stars and the moon. This means that the doors to those chambers can only be opened with an item imbued with that same power.${prompt};Especially after all the trouble I've gone through to raise a tough-as-nails, wicked-wand-wielding, savage-spell-slinging wizard to take over as Orastery minister...${prompt}
The rings carry-warried by the ministers are such items. Every time a minister is appointed, a ring is made and presented to the new minister by Heavens Tower.${prompt};Listen up and I'll explain about the door deep below the tower.${prompt}
After learning this, I took the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} and set off for the Dark Dungeon...${prompt};This door, as you've discovered, can be opened by the power of the stars and the moon. Everything in the Horutoto Ruins is governed by this power.${prompt}
Give it up, Apururu.;However, the magic sealing these doors was weakened when several of the towers were severely damaged during the Great War.${prompt}
That seal is beyond you.${prompt};And so up until now, these doors could have been opened with a single minister's ring--no need for a charm created by Tour des Cieux, like before.${prompt}
Professor Shantotto...${prompt};...!${prompt}
I heard you were sneaking around, asking people about the Dark Dungeon.;Haven't you figured it out? What does that head of yours contain?
Why don't you just stand at the top of Heavens Tower and yell, “I'm going to break my brother out of jail. Arrest me, someone!”${prompt};You would have realized it by now if you were using that melon you call a brain.${prompt}
How imprudent.;If you'll recall, Ajido-Marujido restored the power of the ruins, my dear dumpling.
And you were always such a bright student.${prompt};Now, you are no longer able to open the doors by using just a single ring.${prompt}
I won'taru just stand by and let my brother waste away in there! But I can't...the door won't...${prompt};Ohoho, such stupidity!${prompt}
I understand how you feel. I don't want to lose him either.;......${prompt}
Especially after all the trouble I've gone through to raise a tough-as-nails, wicked-wand-wielding, savage-spell-slinging wizard to take over as Orastery minister...${prompt};...Ah, forgive my amusement. I didn't come just to laugh at you.
Listen up and I'll explain about the door deep below the tower.${prompt};I have a brilliant idea to help your brother through.${prompt}
This door, as you've discovered, can be opened by the power of the stars and the moon. Everything in the Horutoto Ruins is governed by this power.${prompt};Really, Professor Shantotto?
However, the magic sealing these doors was weakened when several of the towers were severely damaged during the Great War.${prompt};Please tell me what I have to do.${prompt}
And so up until now, these doors could have been opened with a single minister's ring--no need for a charm created by Heavens Tower, like before.${prompt};Ohoho!
...!${prompt};You must gather the rings of the five ministers. Yes, yes. It is a chore.
Haven't you figured it out? What does that head of yours contain?;But, using their combined power, you should be able to dispel the seal on the door.${prompt}
You would have realized it by now if you were using that melon you call a brain.${prompt};Bring the five rings to my house in Windurst Walls.
If you'll recall, Ajido-Marujido restored the power of the ruins, my dear dumpling.;We can only get started when you have them all.
Now, you are no longer able to open the doors by using just a single ring.${prompt};Ohoho!${prompt}
Ohoho, such stupidity!${prompt};Thank you so much, Professor. I will never forget this.${prompt}
......${prompt};You'd better not. Ah, and there's one more thing you'd better not forget.
...Ah, forgive my amusement. I didn't come just to laugh at you.;Don't think of going after the rings yourself. It would be something you'd regret.${prompt}
I have a brilliant idea to help your brother through.${prompt};Leave it to an adventurer who's capable.
Really, Professor Shantotto?;Do you know ${name-player}? ${choice-player-gender}[He's/She's] very useful and usable.${prompt}
Please tell me what I have to do.${prompt};It almost boggles the mind how eager ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] is to stick ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] nose into some dangerous squeeze.
Ohoho!;There's no reason not to take advantage of ${name-player}'s natural tendencies.${prompt}
You must gather the rings of the five ministers. Yes, yes. It is a chore.;This is why I need your help.
But, using their combined power, you should be able to dispel the seal on the door.${prompt};Here... This is my ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Bring the five rings to my house in Windurst Walls.;I know it's a lot to ask, but...please save my brother. I beg of you.${prompt}
We can only get started when you have them all.;With the rings of the five ministers, I should be able to open the Dark Dungeon. Please gather all five rings and take them to Professor Shantotto.${prompt}
Ohoho!${prompt};Please, save Ajido-Marujido. My poor, dear brother...${prompt}
Thank you so much, Professor. I will never forget this.${prompt};We have a lot to thank Minister Ajido-Marujido for. He might have mumble-grumbled about it, but he was always there to bail the Manustery out of money troubles.${prompt}
You'd better not. Ah, and there's one more thing you'd better not forget.;We justaru follow whatever Minister Apururu decides. No mattaru what happens, we're behind her until the fat Galka sings.${prompt}
Don't think of going after the rings yourself. It would be something you'd regret.${prompt};Minister Ajido-Marujido succeeded in reactivating the towers, didn'taru he?${prompt}
Leave it to an adventurer who's capable.;Isn't that a good thing?
Do you know ${name-player}? ${choice-player-gender}[He's/She's] very useful and usable.${prompt};Why'd they have to go and throw him into the Dark Dungeon?${prompt}
It almost boggles the mind how eager ${choice-player-gender}[he/she] is to stick ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] nose into some dangerous squeeze.;“Rules were made to be broken.”
There's no reason not to take advantage of ${name-player}'s natural tendencies.${prompt};That way of thinking got Minister Ajido-Marujido thrown in the slammer-wammer.${prompt}
This is why I need your help.;And now his younger sister, Minister Apururu, has taken up the motto:
Here... This is my ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};“Jails were made to be broken.”${prompt}
I know it's a lot to ask, but...please save my brother. I beg of you.${prompt};Of course! I had totarully forgotten.
With the rings of the five ministers, I should be able to open the Dark Dungeon. Please gather all five rings and take them to Professor Shantotto.${prompt};When my brother was arrested, his ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} was confiscated by Tour des Cieux...${prompt}
Please, save Ajido-Marujido. My poor, dear brother...${prompt};There's no way Semih Lafihna will just hand it over for no good reason. Maybe if you try talking with Kupipi...${prompt}
We have a lot to thank Minister Ajido-Marujido for. He might have mumble-grumbled about it, but he was always there to bail the Manustery out of money troubles.${prompt};What's that!?
We justaru follow whatever Minister Apururu decides. No mattaru what happens, we're behind her until the fat Galka sings.${prompt};The Cardians have chosen a king!?
Minister Ajido-Marujido succeeded in reactivating the towers, didn'taru he?${prompt};What on Vana'diel are they thinking!?${prompt}
Isn't that a good thing?;I understand when Cardians no longer follow the orders of their masters. This happens when the concept of “master” ceases to have meaning to them.${prompt}
Why'd they have to go and throw him into the Dark Dungeon?${prompt};But after this has happened, they shouldn't be taking on a new master. For that to happen...${prompt}
“Rules were made to be broken.”;......
That way of thinking got Minister Ajido-Marujido thrown in the slammer-wammer.${prompt};No. It's not possible!${prompt}
And now his younger sister, Minister Apururu, has taken up the motto:;......
“Jails were made to be broken.”${prompt};But putting that aside for the moment, please take the rings to Professor Shantotto in Windurst Walls.${prompt}
Of course! I had totarully forgotten.;I mustaru apologize, I was a little-bitty distracted by what you told me...${prompt}
When my brother was arrested, his ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]} was confiscated by Heavens Tower...${prompt};...Please take the rings to Professor Shantotto in Windurst Walls.${prompt}
There's no way Semih Lafihna will just hand it over for no good reason. Maybe if you try talking with Kupipi...${prompt};I mustaru apologize, I was a little-bitty distracted by what you told me...${prompt}
What's that!?;You've completed the preparations for opening the Dark Dungeon!? Wonderful! You have my mostaru heartfelt thanks!${prompt}
The Cardians have chosen a king!?;Now, to the Dark Dungeon we go!
What on Vana'diel are they thinking!?${prompt};...Oh, that won't do. Professor Shantotto said I shouldn't be seen traveling with you.${prompt}
I understand when Cardians no longer follow the orders of their masters. This happens when the concept of “master” ceases to have meaning to them.${prompt};We'll rendezvous by the door. Please be careful, ${name-player}.${prompt}
But after this has happened, they shouldn't be taking on a new master. For that to happen...${prompt};Now, to the Dark Dungeon we go!
......;...Oh, that won't do. Professor Shantotto said I shouldn't be seen traveling with you.${prompt}
No. It's not possible!${prompt};We'll rendezvous by the door. Please be careful, ${name-player}.${prompt}
......;${name-player}.
But putting that aside for the moment, please take the rings to Professor Shantotto in Windurst Walls.${prompt};...My brother has yet to open his eyes...${prompt}
I mustaru apologize, I was a little-bitty distracted by what you told me...${prompt};Professor Shantotto came to check on his condition, but there was nothing she could do...
...Please take the rings to Professor Shantotto in Windurst Walls.${prompt};If he doesn't regain consciousness...${prompt}
I mustaru apologize, I was a little-bitty distracted by what you told me...${prompt};......
You've completed the preparations for opening the Dark Dungeon!? Wonderful! You have my mostaru heartfelt thanks!${prompt};But I must stay strong. Thank you, adventurer.${prompt}
Now, to the Dark Dungeon we go!;I will never forget what you have done to help my dear brother.${prompt}
...Oh, that won't do. Professor Shantotto said I shouldn't be seen traveling with you.${prompt};Oh, and about the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}... Professor Shantotto still...${prompt}
We'll rendezvous by the door. Please be careful, ${name-player}.${prompt};Well, perhaps you should go and ask the professor.${prompt}
Now, to the Dark Dungeon we go!;${name-player}.
...Oh, that won't do. Professor Shantotto said I shouldn't be seen traveling with you.${prompt};...My brother has yet to open his eyes...${prompt}
We'll rendezvous by the door. Please be careful, ${name-player}.${prompt};Professor Shantotto came to check on his condition, but there was nothing she could do...
${name-player}.;If he doesn't regain consciousness...${prompt}
...My brother has yet to open his eyes...${prompt};Things don'taru look good.
Professor Shantotto came to check on his condition, but there was nothing she could do...;If Ajido-Marujido doesn't wake up, Minister Apururu may have murder-wurder to answer for...not just a jailbreak!${prompt}
If he doesn't regain consciousness...${prompt};Wait a minute.
......;Wasn't there an adventurer who went to the dungeon with the minister? What if we shift all the blame onto ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]...?${prompt}
But I must stay strong. Thank you, adventurer.${prompt};You're worried, rightaru?
I will never forget what you have done to help my dear brother.${prompt};I'm worried about Minister Ajido-Marujido, too.${prompt}
Oh, and about the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}... Professor Shantotto still...${prompt};I'm so worried, the Cardians I've made have learned how to sigh from me. What a dilemma. <sigh>${prompt}
Well, perhaps you should go and ask the professor.${prompt};I can'taru believe there was a jailbreaky!
${name-player}.;Minister Apururu is so cooly!${prompt}
...My brother has yet to open his eyes...${prompt};But I get the feelingy there was someone along to help her... It went just a little too well for one of Minister Apururu's schemeys.${prompt}
Professor Shantotto came to check on his condition, but there was nothing she could do...;There's a Windurst Waters merrrchant making a big fuss over a Mana Orb, you say?${prompt}
If he doesn't regain consciousness...${prompt};Ahaha, serves him rrright!
Things don'taru look good.;That old coot, Honoi-Gomoi, always trrrying to get what he wants by any means possible.${prompt}
If Ajido-Marujido doesn't wake up, Minister Apururu may have murder-wurder to answer for...not just a jailbreak!${prompt};He seems terribly anxious to get his hands on that orb. Why don't you be a sporrrt and give it back? I promise I won't say anything.${prompt}
Wait a minute.;You want to talk to me about Mana Orbs?
Wasn't there an adventurer who went to the dungeon with the minister? What if we shift all the blame onto ${choice-player-gender}[him/her]...?${prompt};I'm sorry, but I'm up to my earlobes in work at the moment. Could you come back another time?${prompt}
You're worried, rightaru?;This is...
I'm worried about Minister Ajido-Marujido, too.${prompt};This is a terribly-werribly old Cardian card...${prompt}
I'm so worried, the Cardians I've made have learned how to sigh from me. What a dilemma. <sigh>${prompt};But there's something strange about it. There's no mark, just this odd-bodd picture. I can't sense any magic from it, either.${prompt}
I can'taru believe there was a jailbreaky!;How unusual. Ordinarily, Cardian cards are imbued with powerful magic.${prompt}
Minister Apururu is so cooly!${prompt};The Cardian cards were a creation of my father, the previous Minister of the Manustery. The holder of the card could use it to remove the magic animating the card's respective Cardian.${prompt}
But I get the feelingy there was someone along to help her... It went just a little too well for one of Minister Apururu's schemeys.${prompt};Do you understand the whammy-ramifications of this? The older Cardians could use the cards in their possession to deactivate other Cardians.${prompt}
There's a Windurst Waters merrrchant making a big fuss over a Mana Orb, you say?${prompt};...My father had essentially made it possible for Cardians to kill each other, just like people can. Isn't that horrible-worrible...?${prompt}
Ahaha, serves him rrright!;Ah, forgive me!
That old coot, Honoi-Gomoi, always trrrying to get what he wants by any means possible.${prompt};I seem to have drifted on to a darker topic.
He seems terribly anxious to get his hands on that orb. Why don't you be a sporrrt and give it back? I promise I won't say anything.${prompt};Enough of that, back to this card!${prompt}
You want to talk to me about Mana Orbs?;This card holds no power over its respective Cardian. Which means it's more than likely just a reject.${prompt}
I'm sorry, but I'm up to my earlobes in work at the moment. Could you come back another time?${prompt};Either that...or could it be...
This is...;This card has no respective Cardian?
This is a terribly-werribly old Cardian card...${prompt};That would mean that this is a unique card...${prompt}
But there's something strange about it. There's no mark, just this odd-bodd picture. I can't sense any magic from it, either.${prompt};${name-player}, please let me buy this card off you!
How unusual. Ordinarily, Cardian cards are imbued with powerful magic.${prompt};I'm sure there's more to this than meets the eye!${prompt}
The Cardian cards were a creation of my father, the previous Minister of the Manustery. The holder of the card could use it to remove the magic animating the card's respective Cardian.${prompt};Have you heard?
Do you understand the whammy-ramifications of this? The older Cardians could use the cards in their possession to deactivate other Cardians.${prompt};Ajido-Marujido has rrregained consciousness.${prompt}
...My father had essentially made it possible for Cardians to kill each other, just like people can. Isn't that horrible-worrible...?${prompt};Word of these goings-on has yet to rrreach Tour des Cieux, so keep up the charade on your way to the Manustery.${prompt}
Ah, forgive me!;Ajido-Marujido had been in a coma since collapsing in the Dark Dungeon, rrright?${prompt}
I seem to have drifted on to a darker topic.;He would probably be dead by now if no one had gone to save him. What an awful place.${prompt}
Enough of that, back to this card!${prompt};Th-the Orastery Minister has finally r-regained c-consciousness.${prompt}
This card holds no power over its respective Cardian. Which means it's more than likely just a reject.${prompt};D-do you realize now what a t-terrible-werrible place the Dark Dungeon is? Even a p-powerful mage like Ajido-Marujido wasn't immune to its e-effects.${prompt}
Either that...or could it be...;These Tarutaru sure can be a vicious little bunch.${prompt}
This card has no respective Cardian?;We Mithra would neverrr leave someone anguishing in torment like that. Those who transgress against Mithran law are cut down cleanly and face-to-face by the Mithran Trackerrr.${prompt}
That would mean that this is a unique card...${prompt};Tour des Cieux is gonna, like, totally notice that the Dark Dungeon is empty at any time now.${prompt}
${name-player}, please let me buy this card off you!;We Mithra are born with, you know, a sixth sense and stuff. You can bet that Semih Lafihna's tail is totally twitching right now.${prompt}
I'm sure there's more to this than meets the eye!${prompt};Ah, ${name-player}--my dear brother has finally woken from his coma!${prompt}
Have you heard?;He's right here. Please come with me!${prompt}
Ajido-Marujido has rrregained consciousness.${prompt};${name-player}, we have some serious-werious problems!${prompt}
Word of these goings-on has yet to rrreach Heavens Tower, so keep up the charade on your way to the Manustery.${prompt};Thanks to you, I was able to see all that was written in the Book of the Gods. We must act before Windurst is wiped off the face of Vana'diel...${prompt}
Ajido-Marujido had been in a coma since collapsing in the Dark Dungeon, rrright?${prompt};After I found you missing from the Dark Dungeon, I knew I'd find you here, Ajido-Marujido!${prompt}
He would probably be dead by now if no one had gone to save him. What an awful place.${prompt};Semih Lafihna!?${prompt}
Th-the Orastery Minister has finally r-regained c-consciousness.${prompt};Great galloping gigas, I just can't get away from you...${prompt}
D-do you realize now what a t-terrible-werrible place the Dark Dungeon is? Even a p-powerful mage like Ajido-Marujido wasn't immune to its e-effects.${prompt};I'm not here to arrest you this time. You must come with me to Tour des Cieux immediately!${prompt}
These Tarutaru sure can be a vicious little bunch.${prompt};The bearer of darkness has returned!${prompt}
We Mithra would neverrr leave someone anguishing in torment like that. Those who transgress against Mithran law are cut down cleanly and face-to-face by the Mithran Trackerrr.${prompt};The bearer of darkness!?
Heavens Tower is gonna, like, totally notice that the Dark Dungeon is empty at any time now.${prompt};What of the Star Sibyl?${prompt}
We Mithra are born with, you know, a sixth sense and stuff. You can bet that Semih Lafihna's tail is totally twitching right now.${prompt};We don't know. We haven't been able to open the door to her chambers. But with your magic, we should be able to get in...${prompt}
Ah, ${name-player}--my dear brother has finally woken from his coma!${prompt};I don't think I've ever seen Semih Lafihna in such a tizzy-wizzy.${prompt}
He's right here. Please come with me!${prompt};The Star Sibyl... Ajido-Marujido... I hope they'll be okay...${prompt}
${name-player}, we have some serious-werious problems!${prompt};Goddess! Are you certain? Ajido-Marujido has received a pardon from the Star Sibyl!?${prompt}
Thanks to you, I was able to see all that was written in the Book of the Gods. We must act before Windurst is wiped off the face of Vana'diel...${prompt};And permission to enter Karaha-Baruha's Animastery... No matter how many times I hear it, I just can'taru believe it...!${prompt}
After I found you missing from the Dark Dungeon, I knew I'd find you here, Ajido-Marujido!${prompt};Apururu. I know you have-ethy a lot on your mind with Ajido-Marujido and all, but I wonder if I might have a moment-ethy?${wait-animation: 2}
Semih Lafihna!?${prompt};Doctor Yoran-Oran!${prompt}
Great galloping gigas, I just can't get away from you...${prompt};Ahem. I was given this letter by an adventurer. Apparently it was dropped-ethy by a mandragora inside the Boyahda Tree...${prompt}
I'm not here to arrest you this time. You must come with me to Heavens Tower immediately!${prompt};...?${prompt}
The bearer of darkness has returned!${prompt};Wait, this handwriting...!?${prompt}
The bearer of darkness!?;I see you recognize-ethy the author. He's being held-ethy prisoner somewhere in the Boyahda Tree, and needs help to escape.${prompt}
What of the Star Sibyl?${prompt};But I figured-ethy, considering who...
We don't know. We haven't been able to open the door to her chambers. But with your magic, we should be able to get in...${prompt};I figured-ethy I should leave this mattaru up to you and your brother.${prompt}
I don't think I've ever seen Semih Lafihna in such a tizzy-wizzy.${prompt};So much has passed-ethy between you siblings and the author of that letter. I'll justaru pretend-ethy that I never saw it.${prompt}
The Star Sibyl... Ajido-Marujido... I hope they'll be okay...${prompt};Well, I've taken up enough-ethy of your time. Keep your chin up, little Apururu.${prompt}
Goddess! Are you certain? Ajido-Marujido has received a pardon from the Star Sibyl!?${prompt};What should I do...? I can't think straightaru. All this time I thought he had died.${prompt}
And permission to enter Karaha-Baruha's Animastery... No matter how many times I hear it, I just can'taru believe it...!${prompt};Goddess above! My father, alive! I don't know what to do. What should I do, adventurer?${prompt}
Apururu. I know you have-ethy a lot on your mind with Ajido-Marujido and all, but I wonder if I might have a moment-ethy?${wait-animation: 2};What to do?
Doctor Yoran-Oran!${prompt};${selection-lines}
Ahem. I was given this letter by an adventurer. Apparently it was dropped-ethy by a mandragora inside the Boyahda Tree...${prompt};We must save him!
...?${prompt};Leave him to rot!${prompt}
Wait, this handwriting...!?${prompt};Usually, that would be my firstaru thought, but...${prompt}
I see you recognize-ethy the author. He's being held-ethy prisoner somewhere in the Boyahda Tree, and needs help to escape.${prompt};I almostaru wish I could, but...${prompt}
But I figured-ethy, considering who...;Could I ask you to help me? I want you to go to the Boyahda Tree and find my father...Zonpa-Zippa.${prompt}
I figured-ethy I should leave this mattaru up to you and your brother.${prompt};And when you do find him, if...if he really is alive, I have some questions I want you to ask him. Why did the Cardians rise up against him? Who is this Cardian they have chosen for a king?${prompt}
So much has passed-ethy between you siblings and the author of that letter. I'll justaru pretend-ethy that I never saw it.${prompt};Help Apururu?
Well, I've taken up enough-ethy of your time. Keep your chin up, little Apururu.${prompt};${selection-lines}
What should I do...? I can't think straightaru. All this time I thought he had died.${prompt};Leave it to me!
Goddess above! My father, alive! I don't know what to do. What should I do, adventurer?${prompt};Leave him to rot!${prompt}
What to do?;I'm begging you. I have no desire to see my father again. I don'taru want to end up hating him even more than I do now.${prompt}
${selection-lines};${name-player}, thank you for being so understanding!${prompt}
We must save him!;Ah, one more thing. Please don't tell any of this to my brother. I wouldn't want news of our father to interfere with his importantaru research.${prompt}
Leave him to rot!${prompt};If my father really is alive in the Boyahda Tree, I have some questions I want you to ask him. Why did the Cardians rise up against him? Who is this Cardian they have chosen for a king?${prompt}
Usually, that would be my firstaru thought, but...${prompt};I really should be asking my dear brother's advice on this mattaru, but I wouldn't want news of our father to interfere with his research...${prompt}
I almostaru wish I could, but...${prompt};...
Could I ask you to help me? I want you to go to the Boyahda Tree and find my father...Zonpa-Zippa.${prompt};I still can'taru believe my father was alive...${prompt}
And when you do find him, if...if he really is alive, I have some questions I want you to ask him. Why did the Cardians rise up against him? Who is this Cardian they have chosen for a king?${prompt};Hmm? You have a letter from him? An explanation for the actions of the Cardians?${prompt}
Help Apururu?;This is incredible...! Joker was created by the famous Karaha-Baruha...!?${prompt}
${selection-lines};What was that bit about Karaha-Baruha?${wait-animation: 1}
Leave it to me!;...Ajido-Marujido!${prompt}
Leave him to rot!${prompt};What's wrong with you? You went all pasty-wasty white as soon as you saw me. What mischief have you been up to?${prompt}
I'm begging you. I have no desire to see my father again. I don'taru want to end up hating him even more than I do now.${prompt};I...${prompt}
${name-player}, thank you for being so understanding!${prompt};I don't know what to say. To hear this...and on top of knowing the old coot was still breathing...${prompt}
Ah, one more thing. Please don't tell any of this to my brother. I wouldn't want news of our father to interfere with his importantaru research.${prompt};The King of the Cardians is the creation of a dead genius? What on Vana'diel is going on!?${prompt}
If my father really is alive in the Boyahda Tree, I have some questions I want you to ask him. Why did the Cardians rise up against him? Who is this Cardian they have chosen for a king?${prompt};There's something I don't understand. Who brought the Cardian back to life in the first place? How was this possible?${prompt}
I really should be asking my dear brother's advice on this mattaru, but I wouldn't want news of our father to interfere with his research...${prompt};You need a massive amountaru of magic to restore life to a Cardian. Not to mention the use of forbidden rituals...${prompt}
...;...${prompt}
I still can'taru believe my father was alive...${prompt};Even more importantaru is the fact that the ritual would have brought Karaha-Baruha back from the dead.${prompt}
Hmm? You have a letter from him? An explanation for the actions of the Cardians?${prompt};And if he really is alive and kicking again, why hasn't he been to see the Star Sibyl?${prompt}
This is incredible...! Joker was created by the famous Karaha-Baruha...!?${prompt};Is there something preventaruing him from putting in an appearance? Or is he planning something, off in the shadows...?${prompt}
What was that bit about Karaha-Baruha?${wait-animation: 1};...
...Ajido-Marujido!${prompt};A summoning...${prompt}
What's wrong with you? You went all pasty-wasty white as soon as you saw me. What mischief have you been up to?${prompt};That's it! Karaha-Baruha was focused on perfecting a “complete summoning.”${prompt}
I...${prompt};Karaha-Baruha wasn't trying to enlist the aid of the Great Beast, Fenrir. He wanted to completely enslave its will.${prompt}
I don't know what to say. To hear this...and on top of knowing the old coot was still breathing...${prompt};If he had succeeded in his efforts... Karaha-Baruha wouldn't be the only one brought back to life...${prompt}
The King of the Cardians is the creation of a dead genius? What on Vana'diel is going on!?${prompt};${name-player}! The Full Moon Fountain! We mustaru stop the Star Sibyl!${prompt}
There's something I don't understand. Who brought the Cardian back to life in the first place? How was this possible?${prompt};${name-player}, please go after my brother!${prompt}
You need a massive amountaru of magic to restore life to a Cardian. Not to mention the use of forbidden rituals...${prompt};The Full Moon Fountain...! I've got an awfully bad feeling about this!${prompt}
...${prompt};...
Even more importantaru is the fact that the ritual would have brought Karaha-Baruha back from the dead.${prompt};I g-got an advance on my s-salary...${prompt}
And if he really is alive and kicking again, why hasn't he been to see the Star Sibyl?${prompt};This m-month I have to try to g-get by on ${item-plural: 1[2]}...${prompt}
Is there something preventaruing him from putting in an appearance? Or is he planning something, off in the shadows...?${prompt};......
...;Grrr...${prompt}
A summoning...${prompt};Captain Buuma said something that really upset me...! I'm in such a state, my furrr is starting to fall out...!${prompt}
That's it! Karaha-Baruha was focused on perfecting a “complete summoning.”${prompt};I just saw Ajido-Marujido leaving the Manustery in, like, full view...${prompt}
Karaha-Baruha wasn't trying to enlist the aid of the Great Beast, Fenrir. He wanted to completely enslave its will.${prompt};Should he be, y'know, walking around outside and stuff? Shouldn't he be using, like, some sorta invisibility spell thingy?${prompt}
If he had succeeded in his efforts... Karaha-Baruha wouldn't be the only one brought back to life...${prompt};What happened at the Full Moon Fountain? I wanted to ask my brother, but he hasn't visitarued the Manustery at all lately.${prompt}
${name-player}! The Full Moon Fountain! We mustaru stop the Star Sibyl!${prompt};Maybe I should go to the Animastery to talk with him. Something about all this is really giving me the heeber-jeebers...${prompt}
${name-player}, please go after my brother!${prompt};I heard that Minsiter Ajido-Marujido was pardoned for his crimes. Well, isn'taru that a surprise?${prompt}
The Full Moon Fountain...! I've got an awfully bad feeling about this!${prompt};This is, y'know, one of those high-level, governmentaru things. There's gotta be some back room, political-type dealy-weals going on here.${prompt}
...;Do you know what's going on, ${name-player}? Ajido-Marujido has been pardoned for his crimes, and the guards have escaped any disciplinary action, despite our insubordination...${prompt}
I g-got an advance on my s-salary...${prompt};Has something happened within Tour des Cieux? They've sent us another mission for you.${prompt}
This m-month I have to try to g-get by on ${item-plural: 1[2]}...${prompt};According to the mission statement, the Yagudo have proposed a rrrevision to the peace treaty...${prompt}
......;...
Grrr...${prompt};I'm well aware I shouldn't be poking my nose where it doesn't belong, but my Mithran instincts are making my tail twitch.${prompt}
Captain Buuma said something that really upset me...! I'm in such a state, my furrr is starting to fall out...!${prompt};Tour des Cieux has rrrequested your presence. The Yagudo have sent a proposal to the Star Sibyl asking for a rrrevision of the peace treaty.${prompt}
I just saw Ajido-Marujido leaving the Manustery in, like, full view...${prompt};The Star Sibyl is more likely to keep the peace, rrrather than object to any of the Yagudo's rrridiculous demands...${prompt}
Should he be, y'know, walking around outside and stuff? Shouldn't he be using, like, some sorta invisibility spell thingy?${prompt};...
What happened at the Full Moon Fountain? I wanted to ask my brother, but he hasn't visitarued the Manustery at all lately.${prompt};Naturally, I have been informed of Semih Lafihna's report to Chieftainness Perih Vashai.${prompt}
Maybe I should go to the Animastery to talk with him. Something about all this is really giving me the heeber-jeebers...${prompt};Let us worry about the Yagudo--You just keep your mind on the task you have been given. Are we clear?${prompt}
I heard that Minsiter Ajido-Marujido was pardoned for his crimes. Well, isn'taru that a surprise?${prompt};M-Minister Ajido-Marujido has been a-absolved of his crimes! N-now Windurst can f-finally return to a state of peace!${prompt}
This is, y'know, one of those high-level, governmentaru things. There's gotta be some back room, political-type dealy-weals going on here.${prompt};...Wh-what?
Do you know what's going on, ${name-player}? Ajido-Marujido has been pardoned for his crimes, and the guards have escaped any disciplinary action, despite our insubordination...${prompt};Wh-why are you l-looking at me with p-pity like thataru...?${prompt}
Has something happened within Heavens Tower? They've sent us another mission for you.${prompt};P-please don't t-tell me something else is wr-wrong!${prompt}
According to the mission statement, the Yagudo have proposed a rrrevision to the peace treaty...${prompt};Captain Buuma was saying that our work might dry up completely after this next mission. If that happens, I'm gonna go hungry.${prompt}
...;That's why I've started fishing again. I bought the most amazing fishing rod! It was so nice of Miiri-Wohri to lend me the money!${prompt}
I'm well aware I shouldn't be poking my nose where it doesn't belong, but my Mithran instincts are making my tail twitch.${prompt};Even though you, like, totally trrrashed the beastmen's boss guy, the Yagudo still act like they're tougher than us.${prompt}
Heavens Tower has rrrequested your presence. The Yagudo have sent a proposal to the Star Sibyl asking for a rrrevision of the peace treaty.${prompt};Something fishy's going on. It's like, the Yagudo are prrreying on our weaknesses...or something like that. You're, y'know, all important and stuff, so you should know what's going on, rrright?${prompt}
The Star Sibyl is more likely to keep the peace, rrrather than object to any of the Yagudo's rrridiculous demands...${prompt};${name-player}, you have the task of gathering the three verses left by the ancient ones, don'taru you?${prompt}
...;Ajido-Marujido mentioned Ro'Maeve, the Chamber of Oracles, and The Temple of Uggalepih...I'm pretty sure.${prompt}
Naturally, I have been informed of Semih Lafihna's report to Chieftainness Perih Vashai.${prompt};All this talk of ancient peoples and places I've never-ever even heard of... My brother seems to have gained some amazing knowledge.${prompt}
Let us worry about the Yagudo--You just keep your mind on the task you have been given. Are we clear?${prompt};I'm certain that we'll be able to save the Star Sibyl now that he's back with us. We mustaru play our parts, too.${prompt}
M-Minister Ajido-Marujido has been a-absolved of his crimes! N-now Windurst can f-finally return to a state of peace!${prompt};Minister Apururu has been up late every night, researchingy the old Cardians made by Zonpa-Zippa.${prompt}
...Wh-what?;It's really very simple if you wanted to disabley the old Cardians. All you would have to do is searchy out Minister Zonpa-Zippa and takey him out of the picture...${prompt}
Wh-why are you l-looking at me with p-pity like thataru...?${prompt};Wa-wa-wait!
P-please don't t-tell me something else is wr-wrong!${prompt};That justaru slippedy out! I don'taru want to go to the Dark Dungeon!${prompt}
Captain Buuma was saying that our work might dry up completely after this next mission. If that happens, I'm gonna go hungry.${prompt};You would definitely be able to slow the Cardians down with a big ol' blast of magey-wagey power.${prompt}
That's why I've started fishing again. I bought the most amazing fishing rod! It was so nice of Miiri-Wohri to lend me the money!${prompt};But the problem is where do you get that kinda power, and who do you get to handle it? To be perfectaruly honest I don't think Miss Apururu is up to it.${prompt}
Even though you, like, totally trrrashed the beastmen's boss guy, the Yagudo still act like they're tougher than us.${prompt};Hmmm...if you could draw on the Mana Orbs of all the Cardians in town then maybe...
Something fishy's going on. It's like, the Yagudo are prrreying on our weaknesses...or something like that. You're, y'know, all important and stuff, so you should know what's going on, rrright?${prompt};I better not suggestaru that to the minister, she would just keel over from worry.${prompt}
${name-player}, you have the task of gathering the three verses left by the ancient ones, don'taru you?${prompt};Minsiter Apururu is doing her bestaru to hide something from us...${prompt}
Ajido-Marujido mentioned Ro'Maeve, the Chamber of Oracles, and The Temple of Uggalepih...I'm pretty sure.${prompt};But she's so bad at lying-wying it makes it hard for us to pretend that we don't notice.${prompt}
All this talk of ancient peoples and places I've never-ever even heard of... My brother seems to have gained some amazing knowledge.${prompt};...I have heard from Semih Lafihna that a time of rrreckoning has come to this land.${prompt}
I'm certain that we'll be able to save the Star Sibyl now that he's back with us. We mustaru play our parts, too.${prompt};We Mithra have always known that the world is but a sharrrd of a greater power.${prompt}
Minister Apururu has been up late every night, researchingy the old Cardians made by Zonpa-Zippa.${prompt};The abundant life and light born from that sharrrd, that single destiny...${prompt}
It's really very simple if you wanted to disabley the old Cardians. All you would have to do is searchy out Minister Zonpa-Zippa and takey him out of the picture...${prompt};...Leave the Yagudo to us. We will not fall against the tides of evil. You, too, must make your stand.${prompt}
Wa-wa-wait!;There is no need for panic. We alrrready have details on the enemy's army within our grrrasp.${prompt}
That justaru slippedy out! I don'taru want to go to the Dark Dungeon!${prompt};We have done more than simply glare at the Yagudo these past twenty years.${prompt}
You would definitely be able to slow the Cardians down with a big ol' blast of magey-wagey power.${prompt};Several of our units are already concealed near the Yagudo strrronghold.${prompt}
But the problem is where do you get that kinda power, and who do you get to handle it? To be perfectaruly honest I don't think Miss Apururu is up to it.${prompt};As soon as the enemy makes its move, we'll go straight for the thrrroat. I can almost see the panicked faces of those Yagudo wrrretches.${prompt}
Hmmm...if you could draw on the Mana Orbs of all the Cardians in town then maybe...;The magic doll...builtaru by Professor Koru-Moru...${prompt}
I better not suggestaru that to the minister, she would just keel over from worry.${prompt};Wearing the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}...made by Doctor Shantotto...${prompt}
Minsiter Apururu is doing her bestaru to hide something from us...${prompt};Then have Doctor Yoran-Oran constructaru the seal...${prompt}
But she's so bad at lying-wying it makes it hard for us to pretend that we don't notice.${prompt};Oh, adventurer!
...I have heard from Semih Lafihna that a time of rrreckoning has come to this land.${prompt};You've brought all three verses!?${prompt}
We Mithra have always known that the world is but a sharrrd of a greater power.${prompt};It's time then! I mustaru go to Doctor Yoran-Oran's manor and pick up the finished work.${prompt}
The abundant life and light born from that sharrrd, that single destiny...${prompt};My brother should be waiting in Tour des Cieux. Please tell him that I'll be rightaru there!${prompt}
...Leave the Yagudo to us. We will not fall against the tides of evil. You, too, must make your stand.${prompt};Adventurer! We mustaru hurry to the Full Moon Fountain!${prompt}
There is no need for panic. We alrrready have details on the enemy's army within our grrrasp.${prompt};I have no idea what's going to happen, so we should be prepared for the doom-gloomiest worst. It may come down to a battle with the Bearer of Darkness!${prompt}
We have done more than simply glare at the Yagudo these past twenty years.${prompt};You have done your utmost for Windurst these many months. As the Captain of the Windurst Woods guards, I formally extend to you our gratitude and friendship.${prompt}
Several of our units are already concealed near the Yagudo strrronghold.${prompt};If I had my way, you would be permanently stationed in Windurst. However, I know that your adventurer's blood would never allow you to settle down for long.${prompt}
As soon as the enemy makes its move, we'll go straight for the thrrroat. I can almost see the panicked faces of those Yagudo wrrretches.${prompt};Be sure to come back and visit on occasion, though, and bring us tales and aromas of the new lands you pass through on your travels.${prompt}
The magic doll...builtaru by Professor Koru-Moru...${prompt};Ah, ${name-player}!
Wearing the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}...made by Doctor Shantotto...${prompt};S-so good to s-see you!${prompt}
Then have Doctor Yoran-Oran constructaru the seal...${prompt};S-so many t-terrible-werrible things were g-going on that we d-didn'taru know about...${prompt}
Oh, adventurer!;B-but everyone p-pulled together and s-saved the day! I'm j-just s-speechless!${prompt}
You've brought all three verses!?${prompt};Fishing is fun, but I'm a Windurst Woods guard first and foremost! The safety of this city is my top priority!${prompt}
It's time then! I mustaru go to Doctor Yoran-Oran's manor and pick up the finished work.${prompt};Oh, and by the way, I finally learned your name. You're ${name-player}, right?${prompt}
My brother should be waiting in Heavens Tower. Please tell him that I'll be rightaru there!${prompt};It could be just my imagination, but I feel like, y'know, all the Mithra in Windurst have finally become united in spirrrit.${prompt}
Adventurer! We mustaru hurry to the Full Moon Fountain!${prompt};I also feel that we've become, like, buddies with all the little Tarutaru. And you, of course, ${name-player}. You're, like, my hero!${prompt}
I have no idea what's going to happen, so we should be prepared for the doom-gloomiest worst. It may come down to a battle with the Bearer of Darkness!${prompt};I still can'taru believe it. Everything that happened at the Full Moon Fountain seems so surrealy-weal.${prompt}
You have done your utmost for Windurst these many months. As the Captain of the Windurst Woods guards, I formally extend to you our gratitude and friendship.${prompt};It was so scary-wary, and so heartbreakingly sad. But both my brother and the Star Sibyl have come back to us safely.${prompt}
If I had my way, you would be permanently stationed in Windurst. However, I know that your adventurer's blood would never allow you to settle down for long.${prompt};There was nothing I could've done by myselfily-welfily, but with everybody's help, we've broughtaru the light back to Windurst!${prompt}
Be sure to come back and visit on occasion, though, and bring us tales and aromas of the new lands you pass through on your travels.${prompt};Thank you, everyone!
Ah, ${name-player}!;I'm going to work even harder to make the world a better place for everybody to live in.${prompt}
S-so good to s-see you!${prompt};Minister Apururu is still studying the Cardians builty by her father, Zonpa-Zippa.${prompt}
S-so many t-terrible-werrible things were g-going on that we d-didn'taru know about...${prompt};With all the queasy-weasy experiments detailed in the previous minister's notes, though, I don'taru thinky Minister Apururu really wants to read through them...${prompt}
B-but everyone p-pulled together and s-saved the day! I'm j-just s-speechless!${prompt};Maybe she's foundy some clues on how to stop those Cardians. Don't give up, Minister Apururu!${prompt}
Fishing is fun, but I'm a Windurst Woods guard first and foremost! The safety of this city is my top priority!${prompt};Many Cardians died willingly for the sakey-wake of their king, the Cardian Joker.${prompt}
Oh, and by the way, I finally learned your name. You're ${name-player}, right?${prompt};Former minister Zonpa-Zippa loved to build in those sorts of tragic loyalties... He probably put in a self-destructaru mechanism, too.${prompt}
It could be just my imagination, but I feel like, y'know, all the Mithra in Windurst have finally become united in spirrrit.${prompt};The ring of the Manustery has finally-winally made its way back to the hand of Minister Apururu. Now I can make new and improved Cardian-wardians!${prompt}
I also feel that we've become, like, buddies with all the little Tarutaru. And you, of course, ${name-player}. You're, like, my hero!${prompt};Hmm, I think I'll inventaru one that has a spinning staff attack. That should make a nice breezey-weeze for those hot summer days...${prompt}
I still can'taru believe it. Everything that happened at the Full Moon Fountain seems so surrealy-weal.${prompt};It has rrreturned. The great power that belongs to this land...${prompt}
It was so scary-wary, and so heartbreakingly sad. But both my brother and the Star Sibyl have come back to us safely.${prompt};I have come to realize that the world exists to help us find a way to bridge the gaps between the races.${prompt}
There was nothing I could've done by myselfily-welfily, but with everybody's help, we've broughtaru the light back to Windurst!${prompt};And we people are here to fill the emptiness that is borrrn in that world.${prompt}
Thank you, everyone!;Let us move forward to a new future. When you lose sight of tomorrow, just lie upon the earrrth, hear the voice of the wind, and gaze into the endless sky.${prompt}
I'm going to work even harder to make the world a better place for everybody to live in.${prompt};...Adventurer.
Minister Apururu is still studying the Cardians builty by her father, Zonpa-Zippa.${prompt};I prrray that the Windurst that lives in my heart will bloom in your heart as well.${prompt}
With all the queasy-weasy experiments detailed in the previous minister's notes, though, I don'taru thinky Minister Apururu really wants to read through them...${prompt};There was a place in Kazham where you could feel the power of the land.${prompt}
Maybe she's foundy some clues on how to stop those Cardians. Don't give up, Minister Apururu!${prompt};Twenty years ago that same grrreat energy overflowed from the plains of Sarutabaruta. All of our trrroubles began with the loss of that power.${prompt}
Many Cardians died willingly for the sakey-wake of their king, the Cardian Joker.${prompt};After the Great War, the Star Sibyl kept the truth of events from Chieftainness Perih Vashai.${prompt}
Former minister Zonpa-Zippa loved to build in those sorts of tragic loyalties... He probably put in a self-destructaru mechanism, too.${prompt};Considering the nature of Tarutaru, this is not altogether an unusual occurrence. But considering how we fought and died beside them for this land, I can't help but feel betrrrayed.${prompt}
The ring of the Manustery has finally-winally made its way back to the hand of Minister Apururu. Now I can make new and improved Cardian-wardians!${prompt};Ta～da～!!!
Hmm, I think I'll inventaru one that has a spinning staff attack. That should make a nice breezey-weeze for those hot summer days...${prompt};“The All-New C-3000”!${prompt}
It has rrreturned. The great power that belongs to this land...${prompt};This new Cardian is truly amazing, I tell you. Not only can it defeat its enemies before you can say “Now, where's that darn Cardian got to?” but it also brings back the booty from the battleground!${prompt}
I have come to realize that the world exists to help us find a way to bridge the gaps between the races.${prompt};All the loot my new boy'll bring in should stretch the Manustery's coffers to bursty-wursting! Not to mention the hefty raise that'll be added to my salary. <wink-wink>${prompt}
And we people are here to fill the emptiness that is borrrn in that world.${prompt};But first I have to teach him to bring back the good stuff and leave the junk... And that's where you come in, my fine adventuring friend! Do you think you could get me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}?${prompt}
Let us move forward to a new future. When you lose sight of tomorrow, just lie upon the earrrth, hear the voice of the wind, and gaze into the endless sky.${prompt};Let's get cracking! Time is gil, you know!${prompt}
...Adventurer.;Have you broughtaru the items for the All-New C-3000 to look at?${prompt}

There was a place in Kazham where you could feel the power of the land.${prompt};Excellentaru work! Here's something for your troubles!${prompt}
Twenty years ago that same grrreat energy overflowed from the plains of Sarutabaruta. All of our trrroubles began with the loss of that power.${prompt};I'm going to make oodles and scoodles of All-New C-3000s, so bring me all the ${item-plural: 1[2]} and ${item-plural: 2[2]} that you can find.${prompt}
After the Great War, the Star Sibyl kept the truth of events from Chieftainness Perih Vashai.${prompt};Hmm, paying you that reward has put me in the red, but it's all part of a larger investmentaru. I'm gonna be rich!${prompt}
Considering the nature of Tarutaru, this is not altogether an unusual occurrence. But considering how we fought and died beside them for this land, I can't help but feel betrrrayed.${prompt};I'm going to make oodles and scoodles of All-New C-3000s, so bring me all the ${item-plural: 1[2]} and ${item-plural: 2[2]} that you can find.${prompt}
Ta～da～!!!;If you find any more of those ${item-plural: 1[2]} and ${item-plural: 2[2]}, hand 'em over to me!${prompt}
“The All-New C-3000”!${prompt};I don't understand it. The All-New C-3000s haven't been bringing in any ${item-plural: 1[2]} or ${item-plural: 2[2]}...${prompt}
This new Cardian is truly amazing, I tell you. Not only can it defeat its enemies before you can say “Now, where's that darn Cardian got to?” but it also brings back the booty from the battleground!${prompt};Where did I go wrong? All my calculations and adjustments were spot on. Even Minister Apururu said the craftsmanship was perfectaru.${prompt}
All the loot my new boy'll bring in should stretch the Manustery's coffers to bursty-wursting! Not to mention the hefty raise that'll be added to my salary. <wink-wink>${prompt};I can'taru let a little hiccup like this stand in the way of my impending fortune! I'll just keep giving the All-New C-3000s more ${item-plural: 1[2]} and ${item-plural: 2[2]} until they get it right!${prompt}
But first I have to teach him to bring back the good stuff and leave the junk... And that's where you come in, my fine adventuring friend! Do you think you could get me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}?${prompt};Keep on bringing me those items! This is going to work, I can feel it!${prompt}
Let's get cracking! Time is gil, you know!${prompt};Aren't the new Cardians that Kopuro-Popuro is making supposed to be for patrol duty?${prompt}
Have you broughtaru the items for the All-New C-3000 to look at?${prompt};All they're doing is wandering around Sarutabaruta, not fighting anything. I wonder what they're doing out there? Looking for buried treasure?${prompt}
I need you to bring me ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]}. Whatcha waiting for?${prompt};Hmmm.
Excellentaru work! Here's something for your troubles!${prompt};Has it all become clear, my fledgling arrrcher?${prompt}
I'm going to make oodles and scoodles of All-New C-3000s, so bring me all the ${item-plural: 1[2]} and ${item-plural: 2[2]} that you can find.${prompt};Do you know where your place is? The time for the hunt? The prey your arrows should seek?${prompt}
Hmm, paying you that reward has put me in the red, but it's all part of a larger investmentaru. I'm gonna be rich!${prompt};Do you everrr experience moments of hesitation? It is that confusion that sends your arrows wide of the mark.${prompt}
I'm going to make oodles and scoodles of All-New C-3000s, so bring me all the ${item-plural: 1[2]} and ${item-plural: 2[2]} that you can find.${prompt};Take this untrrried bow. It is kindrrred to the slender sapling. As a young tree is bent by the fury of a storrrm, so will this bow's path be warped by your indecision.${prompt}
If you find any more of those ${item-plural: 1[2]} and ${item-plural: 2[2]}, hand 'em over to me!${prompt};Now, my fledgling arrrcher. Go forth and overcome the winds of doubt that taunt your arrow's flight. Trrrain until the sapling bow has become a steady oak in your hands.${prompt}
I don't understand it. The All-New C-3000s haven't been bringing in any ${item-plural: 1[2]} or ${item-plural: 2[2]}...${prompt};What trrroubles you, my fledgling arrrcher? Do you seek counsel in some matter?${prompt}
Where did I go wrong? All my calculations and adjustments were spot on. Even Minister Apururu said the craftsmanship was perfectaru.${prompt};What trrroubles you？
I can'taru let a little hiccup like this stand in the way of my impending fortune! I'll just keep giving the All-New C-3000s more ${item-plural: 1[2]} and ${item-plural: 2[2]} until they get it right!${prompt};${selection-lines}
Keep on bringing me those items! This is going to work, I can feel it!${prompt};I have no questions.
Aren't the new Cardians that Kopuro-Popuro is making supposed to be for patrol duty?${prompt};I lost the ${item-singular: 1[2]}...
All they're doing is wandering around Sarutabaruta, not fighting anything. I wonder what they're doing out there? Looking for buried treasure?${prompt};I give in to the winds.${prompt}
Hmmm.;To lose your bow is to lose yourself. If you forget who you are and what you strrrive for, your future holds only stagnation.${prompt}
Has it all become clear, my fledgling arrrcher?${prompt};My fledgling arrrcher, were you unable to master the doubt within you...?${prompt}

Take this untrrried bow. It is kindrrred to the slender sapling. As a young tree is bent by the fury of a storrrm, so will this bow's path be warped by your indecision.${prompt};Yes, I cannot go on.
Now, my fledgling arrrcher. Go forth and overcome the winds of doubt that taunt your arrow's flight. Trrrain until the sapling bow has become a steady oak in your hands.${prompt};No, I will try harrrder.${prompt}
What trrroubles you, my fledgling arrrcher? Do you seek counsel in some matter?${prompt};That is a pity indeed. You must set the bow free by your own hand. The withered branch rrreturns to the earth. This is the way of nature.${prompt}
What trrroubles you？;When you feel the bow no longer rrresponds to your inner conflict, rrreturn it here to me.${prompt}
${selection-lines};The bow still appears to rrretain the greenness of youth, and your doubt has yet to be rrresolved.${prompt}
I have no questions.;There is no need for haste. The sapling grrrows slowly into the forest giant.${prompt}

I give in to the winds.${prompt};You have grown as well, my fledgling arrrcher. It is time to test the new maturity of your archery.${prompt}
To lose your bow is to lose yourself. If you forget who you are and what you strrrive for, your future holds only stagnation.${prompt};I have prrrepared a battlefield for you at Cape Teriggan. Use this map to find your foe and bring back the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} to prove your victorrry.${prompt}
My fledgling arrrcher, were you unable to master the doubt within you...?${prompt};Cape Teriggan is the battlefield where you will test your newfound maturrrity. Was there anotherrr matter you wished to discuss?${prompt}
Give in to your doubt?;That is most unforrrtunate. However, I'm sure you have just rrreason for your decision. If you ever wish to banish the doubt within you, come once again to my side.${prompt}
${selection-lines};It appears your arrows flew fast and true. I will imparrrt to you a technique worthy of your rrresolve.${prompt}
Yes, I cannot go on.;With strrrength comes potential for new abilities.${prompt}
No, I will try harrrder.${prompt};Do you see, my arrrcher?
That is a pity indeed. You must set the bow free by your own hand. The withered branch rrreturns to the earth. This is the way of nature.${prompt};Strength is the grrreat trunk of the tree, and the rrresultant skills its many branches.${prompt}

Return.${prompt};Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt}
The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:${prompt};“LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt}
First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of “Flammen-Brenner.”${prompt};A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt}
At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with “Flamme,” or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.${prompt};The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt}
Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.${prompt};If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt}
The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.${prompt};After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt}
The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.${prompt};Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt}
If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The “match score” section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.${prompt};In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt}
Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.${prompt};Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt}
You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.${prompt};Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt}
No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.${prompt};However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt}
The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed ${number: 0} members, or if there are fewer than ${number: 1} members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.${prompt};${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt}
Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The ${color: 5}Master of Ceremonies${color: 1} (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.${prompt};Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt}
“LS Liga” is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.${prompt};The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt}
A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.${prompt};In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt}
The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.${prompt};In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt}
If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.${prompt};I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt}
After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.${prompt};You wish to hear of Al'Taieu, adventurer?${prompt}
Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.${prompt};A moment.
In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.${prompt};To ask questions in such a blunt manner does not befit a ${choice: 0}[lady/gentleman].${prompt}
Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.${prompt};My most humble apologies for the intrusion, Chieftainness Perih Vashai.${prompt}
Like Ballista, ${color: 5}quarry${color: 1} (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up ${color: 5}Petras${color: 1} and temporary items.${prompt};My name is Louverance N Mistalle.
However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can ${color: 5}trade${color: 1} a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.${prompt};To save the people of Vana'diel, I seek the truth that hides behind the veil of history.${prompt}
${color: 5}Sprint${color: 1} cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the ${color: 5}scout${color: 1} ability cannot be used in Brenner.${prompt};A time of apocalypse is at hand.
Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.${prompt};I beg you for the guiding knowledge of ages, passed down through the Mithran race...${prompt}
The ${color: 5}sprint${color: 1} (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.${prompt};I understand your situation.
In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.${prompt};However, I know nothing of the city painted in that picture.${prompt}
In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.${prompt};Even if you were to ask the Mithran Trrrackers, I doubt they would have an answer for you.
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?${prompt};They are on a journey to fulfill an important duty.${prompt}
You wish to hear of Al'Taieu, adventurer?${prompt};...?
A moment.;If I may be so bold, are the Mithran Trackers following the scent of some grave crime?${prompt}
To ask questions in such a blunt manner does not befit a ${choice: 0}[lady/gentleman].${prompt};Yes. They came to demand atonement for the sins of the Tavnazian cardinal.${prompt}
My most humble apologies for the intrusion, Chieftainness Perih Vashai.${prompt};The cardinal?
My name is Louverance N Mistalle.;What crime could she have committed?${prompt}
To save the people of Vana'diel, I seek the truth that hides behind the veil of history.${prompt};Strrrangely enough, her sins are related to the picture you speak of.${prompt}
A time of apocalypse is at hand.;That picture was stolen from the Temple of Uggalepih.${prompt}
I beg you for the guiding knowledge of ages, passed down through the Mithran race...${prompt};A Mithran Trrracker traveled to Tavnazia to recover it, but was instead presented with a deal by the cardinal.${prompt}
I understand your situation.;A deal?${prompt}
However, I know nothing of the city painted in that picture.${prompt};The cardinal apparently knew everything about the legend rrrecited by the Mithra, and the duty that it entails.${prompt}
Even if you were to ask the Mithran Trrrackers, I doubt they would have an answer for you.;She also stated that the means to carry out that duty had been prepared in Tavnazia.${prompt}
They are on a journey to fulfill an important duty.${prompt};The trrracker had no choice but to accept the deal.
...?;The fate of Vana'diel's people was placed in the hands of the cardinal.${prompt}
If I may be so bold, are the Mithran Trackers following the scent of some grave crime?${prompt};Chieftainness, indulge me if you will.${prompt}
Yes. They came to demand atonement for the sins of the Tavnazian cardinal.${prompt};What is this legend, and what of the duty it reveals?
The cardinal?;What had your people intended to do?${prompt}
What crime could she have committed?${prompt};That duty was given to the Mithra by the ancient race depicted in the picture.
Strrrangely enough, her sins are related to the picture you speak of.${prompt};A duty to awaken the sleeping gods...${prompt}
That picture was stolen from the Temple of Uggalepih.${prompt};The sleeping gods...!?${prompt}
A Mithran Trrracker traveled to Tavnazia to recover it, but was instead presented with a deal by the cardinal.${prompt};Surely you have heard the tale of the ancient rrrace that wounded Vana'diel by opening the Gates of Paradise?${prompt}
A deal?${prompt};The Emptiness that poured from that wound tried to swallow everything in its path: the mountains, the seas, the skies, the forests, even life itself.${prompt}
The cardinal apparently knew everything about the legend rrrecited by the Mithra, and the duty that it entails.${prompt};The living beings of Vana'diel decided to use the tears that Altana had shed to cleanse the world.${prompt}
She also stated that the means to carry out that duty had been prepared in Tavnazia.${prompt};However, a battle erupted between the king of people and the king of dragons over the fifth tear. A conflict that knew no end...${prompt}
The trrracker had no choice but to accept the deal.;The people that survived used the power of the sleeping gods to heal the wounded land.${prompt}
The fate of Vana'diel's people was placed in the hands of the cardinal.${prompt};And that is the legend told by the Mithra?${prompt}
Chieftainness, indulge me if you will.${prompt};Adventurer.
What is this legend, and what of the duty it reveals?;In your trrravels you would have seen the giant, glowing crystals that lie hidden far away from civilization.${prompt}
What had your people intended to do?${prompt};Those crystals are the rrresting places of the gods.${prompt}
That duty was given to the Mithra by the ancient race depicted in the picture.;Slumbering within are the immortal beings who were called forth to heal the land in the age of legend.${prompt}
A duty to awaken the sleeping gods...${prompt};The wounded land of Vana'diel bleeds forth dreaded Emptiness...${prompt}
The sleeping gods...!?${prompt};It is now time for us to awaken the sleeping deities, and mend our sufferrring world.${prompt}
Surely you have heard the tale of the ancient rrrace that wounded Vana'diel by opening the Gates of Paradise?${prompt};And this is the role that the cardinal attempted to fill?
The Emptiness that poured from that wound tried to swallow everything in its path: the mountains, the seas, the skies, the forests, even life itself.${prompt};But how...?${prompt}
The living beings of Vana'diel decided to use the tears that Altana had shed to cleanse the world.${prompt};That has not yet been rrrevealed to me.${prompt}
However, a battle erupted between the king of people and the king of dragons over the fifth tear. A conflict that knew no end...${prompt};But if you must learn the answer to that question, you should ask the Tavnazian theologian who was a survivor of the Great War.${prompt}
The people that survived used the power of the sleeping gods to heal the wounded land.${prompt};Before she is punished for that crrrime...${prompt}
And that is the legend told by the Mithra?${prompt};...!${prompt}
Adventurer.;Do you need further explanation?
In your trrravels you would have seen the giant, glowing crystals that lie hidden far away from civilization.${prompt};The Mithran sin hunters never forgive a crime.
Those crystals are the rrresting places of the gods.${prompt};The sin does not die with the sinner.${prompt}
Slumbering within are the immortal beings who were called forth to heal the land in the age of legend.${prompt};Be careful with your actions.
The wounded land of Vana'diel bleeds forth dreaded Emptiness...${prompt};It is not our place to judge your sins, but in time, your sins may come to judge you.${prompt}
It is now time for us to awaken the sleeping deities, and mend our sufferrring world.${prompt};What do you make of her words, ${name-player}?${prompt}
And this is the role that the cardinal attempted to fill?;The theology of the Mithra veers quite dramatically from that of the San d'Orian Cathedral in several respects.${prompt}
But how...?${prompt};The legend concerning the five tears of Altana is especially at odds with what the Elvaan believe...${prompt}
That has not yet been rrrevealed to me.${prompt};That is why I warn you not to swallow her tale without question.${prompt}
But if you must learn the answer to that question, you should ask the Tavnazian theologian who was a survivor of the Great War.${prompt};Talk of legends aside, the chieftainness's description of the Emptiness that has appeared in every corner of Vana'diel is an indisputable truth.${prompt}
Before she is punished for that crrrime...${prompt};However, the Mithran Trackers are now chasing after the theologian, Prishe, and not Cardinal Mildaurion.${prompt}
...!${prompt};Which would mean that even the trackers were unable to locate the whereabouts of the cardinal.${prompt}
Do you need further explanation?;Does this mean that the cardinal has already bid farewell to this world?${prompt}
The Mithran sin hunters never forgive a crime.;Has my astonishing luck finally failed me...?${prompt}
The sin does not die with the sinner.${prompt};It is nice to see you after so long, sir.
Be careful with your actions.;I wonder if you remember old Honoi-Gomoi?${prompt}
It is not our place to judge your sins, but in time, your sins may come to judge you.${prompt};I thought you might have informed me of your presence.
What do you make of her words, ${name-player}?${prompt};I was mightaruly surprised to hear that you were in town.${prompt}
The theology of the Mithra veers quite dramatically from that of the San d'Orian Cathedral in several respects.${prompt};As always, your visits cause quite a stir...${prompt}
The legend concerning the five tears of Altana is especially at odds with what the Elvaan believe...${prompt};...${prompt}
That is why I warn you not to swallow her tale without question.${prompt};But I do babble-wabble on.
Talk of legends aside, the chieftainness's description of the Emptiness that has appeared in every corner of Vana'diel is an indisputable truth.${prompt};Your subordinates bade me pass this on to you.${prompt}
However, the Mithran Trackers are now chasing after the theologian, Prishe, and not Cardinal Mildaurion.${prompt};It is an item that should help tremendously in your task.${prompt}
Which would mean that even the trackers were unable to locate the whereabouts of the cardinal.${prompt};But this is...!${prompt}
Does this mean that the cardinal has already bid farewell to this world?${prompt};Yes, indeed.
Has my astonishing luck finally failed me...?${prompt};It was broken when you crossed swords with that detestable Vukki.${prompt}
It is nice to see you after so long, sir.;I went to greataru lengths to have this repaired for you...${prompt}
I wonder if you remember old Honoi-Gomoi?${prompt};What's more, I finally made progress on the task you entrusted to me so long ago.${prompt}
I thought you might have informed me of your presence.;That despicable bounty hunter that caused you so much trouble, “Goldmane”...${prompt}
I was mightaruly surprised to hear that you were in town.${prompt};You have information?${prompt}
As always, your visits cause quite a stir...${prompt};Yes.
...${prompt};According to some Mithran pirates, the rascal has purchased a small, desertarued island south of Mhaura...${prompt}
But I do babble-wabble on.;I see.
Your subordinates bade me pass this on to you.${prompt};My luck has not forsaken me after all...${prompt}
It is an item that should help tremendously in your task.${prompt};${name-player}.
But this is...!${prompt};I ask that you leave the rest of this task to me, alone.${prompt}
Yes, indeed.;My incredible luck does not extend to those around me.
It was broken when you crossed swords with that detestable Vukki.${prompt};It may prove to be more of a hindrance than a help.
I went to greataru lengths to have this repaired for you...${prompt};Until next we meet...${prompt}
What's more, I finally made progress on the task you entrusted to me so long ago.${prompt};Adventurer, I would advise against traveling with that Elvaan. He has a dark, dark past.${prompt}
That despicable bounty hunter that caused you so much trouble, “Goldmane”...${prompt};If one does not cleanse oneself of that darkness, it will rrreturn to haunt them. That is Mother Nature's way...${prompt}
You have information?${prompt};Please have a look at these wonderful products from Qufim Island! You won't regret it!${prompt}

I'm going to savor its delicate flavor...and then I'll let you know what I think! Thank you!${prompt};Oh wow, merci de faire ça pour moi ! J’ai hâte d’avoir mon chocolat !${prompt}
Hey. I heard you're playing the matchmaker around here.${prompt};Quoi ? De quoi as-tu besoin ? Rien ? D’accord, alors !${prompt}
Hmph, guess I might as well let you know my type. I like ${choice: 3}[Humes/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra], and I like 'em ${choice: 2}[cheerful/kind/shy/modest]. I leave this chocolate, and my future, in your hands. Well, go on. Get on with it.${prompt};Wooow, tu m'as vraiment apporté un chocolat !
What? Still...?;Je te dirai plus tard quel goût il a ! Oh, merci, merci ! J'espère que tu pourras aussi avoir un(e) véritable ${choice-player-gender}[petite amie/petit ami] un jour !${prompt}

I don't think I know you.${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit, v-voici un chocolat !${prompt}
Well, you were able to get a finished chocolate after all.;Ahhh !
I need some time to think, though. After all, this could determine my future, so I will taste it later. Thank you.${prompt};Par Altana, tu m'as fait peur !
I have been waiting all my life for this!;Pas encore terminé ? O-oh, je suis désolé !${prompt}
You'll match me up with a girl, right? Wow! Me and a girl, together! Imagine!${prompt};Quoi !?
Oh, oh, let's see...I'll tell you exactly what I want! I want a ${choice: 2}[cheerful/kind/shy/modest] ${choice: 3}[Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra]! She also must cook things like steamed catfish every night, love watching Ballista, and have an interest in airship mechanics...er, ignore those last few requests. Anyway, here's some chocolate! Go get me a woman!${prompt};...Oh, tu veux quelque chose ? J-je vais bien !${prompt}
Oh wow, thanks for doing this for me! I can't wait for my chocolate!${prompt};Ahhh !
What? What do you need? Nothing? Okay, then!${prompt};Tu m'as vraiment apporté un chocolat ! M-mais, je ne vois pas où je pourrais le manger maintenant ! Je devrai dire au mog ce que j'en pense plus tard. Wow, c'est génial ! À plus !${prompt}
Wooow, you really got a chocolate for me!;Salut ! Je t'attendais, chéri ! Tu vas me trouver un véritable amoureux, n'est-ce pas ? Youpi !${prompt}
I'll let you know how it tastes later! Oh, thank you, thank you! I hope you can get a real, live ${choice-player-gender}[girlfriend/boyfriend] someday, too!${prompt};Voici un chocolat ! Il n'a pas l'air délicieux ? Bonne chance !${prompt}
N-no way!;Quel est le problème, pain d'épice ? Tu as des difficultés, n'est-ce pas ? Je veux vraiment un homme, alors dépêche-toi, s'il te plaît !${prompt}
I can meet...a woman? One that...likes me!? ...Oh, wow!${prompt};Hm ? Tu veux quelque chose ?
Anyway, h-here's a chocolate!${prompt};Tu devrais aller parler à un mog !${prompt}
Ahhh!;Oh, je t'attendais ! Je me demande quel goût ça a ! Je te dirai ce que j'en pense plus tard. Merci beaucoup !${prompt}
By Altana, you scared me!;Bonjour !

What!?;Voici un chocolat. Tu as mon soutien ! Je te souhaite bonne chance !${prompt}
...Oh, you want something? I-I'm fine!${prompt};Bonjour ! Tu sembles travailler très dur. Je suis vraiment reconnaissante !
Ahhh!;Mais tu n'as pas besoin de te précipiter autant. Prends ton temps ! Je peux attendre si ça te rend la tâche plus facile !${prompt}
You really got a chocolate for me! B-but, I don't see anywhere I could eat it now! I'll have to tell the moogle what I think later. Wow, this is great! See ya!${prompt};Oui ? Tu as une question ?
Hiya! I've been waiting for you, sugar! Going to find a real sweetheart for me, are you? Yay!${prompt};Oh, je suis désolée. Je pense que tu t'es trompé de personne, mais ne t'inquiète pas !${prompt}
Here's a chocolate! Doesn't it look yummy? Good luck!${prompt};Wow, tu as rapporté un chocolat terminé ! Merci beaucoup !
What's wrong, pumpernickel? Not having trouble, are we? I really want a man, so please hurry up!${prompt};Je me demande quel goût ça a. Hi hi hi, j'ai hâte de l'essayer.
Hm? Want something?;J'espère que tu rencontreras aussi quelqu'un de spécial !${prompt}

Hello! You seem to be working very hard. I'm really thankful!;Oh, t-tu n'as pas encore rapporté de chocolat ? Tu m'as vraiment fait peur, tu sais !
But you needn't rush around so fast. Take your time! I can wait if it makes the job easier for you!${prompt};Quoi qu'il en soit, bonne chance !${prompt}
Yes? You have a question?;O-oui ? Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Oh, I'm sorry. I think you've got the wrong person, but don't worry about it!${prompt};Je...euh, je n'ai besoin de rien...${prompt}
Wow, you brought back a finished chocolate! Thank you so much!;Quoi ? Ce...ça pourrait-il être ? Tu m'as apporté un chocolat ! Je ne peux pas le manger ici, ce serait tellement embarrassant. Mais je le mangerai plus tard, alors merci !${prompt}
I wonder what it tastes like. Teeheehee, I can't wait to try it.;Bonjour...
I hope you meet someone special, too!${prompt};Je ne paie peut-être pas de mine, mais j'espère rencontrer un gentil garçon...${prompt}

<sigh> I can't bring myself to say it!${prompt};Je savais que ce serait difficile de trouver quelqu'un pour une fille comme moi...${prompt}
A-and here's a chocolate... Th-thank you! (I can't believe I just said that!)${prompt};Quel est le problème ?

Oh, y-you haven't brought a chocolate back yet? You really scared me, you know!;Je vois que tu m'as apporté un chocolat. Je ne peux pas dire à quel point il sera bon avant de le goûter, mais peut-être qu'il y a de l'espoir pour moi après tout. Merci beaucoup de m'avoir aidée.${prompt}
Anyway, good luck!${prompt};Venez célébrer la Fête des Poupées avec nous, kupo !${prompt}
Y-yes? What is it?;Nous avons des objets pour tout le monde !
I...um, I don't need anything...${prompt};Les voici, kupo !${prompt}

Please take this chocolate. It may not be the best in the world, but I hope you can use it to find someone.${prompt};Kupopopo～!
You're not finished with the chocolate yet, are you?;C'est terrible !
I knew it would be hard to find someone for a girl like me...${prompt};Des filous sournois ont dérobé l'armure que nous avions apportée pour la Fête des Épées, kupo !${prompt}
What's the matter?;Les méchants portant l'armure sont invulnérables aux armes normales ! Et comme si cela ne suffisait pas, ils sont entourés d'une aura puissante qui empêche toute attaque, kupo !${prompt}
I don't think there's anything I need...${prompt};Mais ne craignez rien !
I see you got a chocolate for me. I can't tell how good it will be until I taste it, but maybe there's hope for me after all. Thanks so much for helping me.${prompt};Nos meilleurs chercheurs mogs ont créé une arme qui peut blesser ces voleurs d'armure !
Come and celebrate the Doll Festival with us, kupo!${prompt};Voici l'étonnante ${item-singular: 0[2]}, kupo !${prompt}
We've got items for everyone!;Les mogs nomades ont également développé une magie qui annulera cette aura anti-attaque, alors assurez-vous de leur rendre visite tout en portant l'arme avant d'affronter l'ennemi, kupo.${prompt}
Here you go, kupo!${prompt};Mais attention, cette magie a pour effet secondaire de vous empêcher d'attaquer tout autre monstre pendant trois jours entiers, kupo !${prompt}
Come again and bring your friends! Each of them will also get an item, kupo!${prompt};Voici votre ${item-singular: 0[2]}.
You can get items only once each day, so come back again tomorrow, kupo!${prompt};Maintenant, vous êtes prêt pour le combat, kupo !${prompt}
You obtain ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 0[2]}, ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 1[2]}, ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 2[2]}, and ${number: 4} ${item-given-plurality: 4[2], 3[2]}!${prompt};Si vous voulez croiser le fer avec les intrus invincibles, équipez-vous de la ${item-singular: 0[2]} et parlez à un mog nomade, kupo !${prompt}
Kupopopo～!;Kupopo !
This is terrible!;L'événement principal du Festival de la Brise Solaire est de retour, et mieux que jamais !${prompt}
Sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords, kupo!${prompt};Et cette fois, il s'appelle Cercle Azimuth...II !${prompt}
The villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt};Voulez-vous en savoir plus, kupo ?${prompt}
But never fear!;Vous voulez en savoir plus ?
Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans!;${selection-lines}
Behold the wondrous ${item-singular: 0[2]}, kupo!${prompt};Raconte-moi tout !
The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt};Ça ira pour l'instant, kupo.${prompt}
But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!${prompt};Pour jouer à Cercle Azimuth II, vous devrez faire équipe avec un partenaire et utiliser une boussole pour chercher un point spécifique.${prompt}
Here's your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.;Donc, votre première étape est de trouver cette personne spéciale et de former une équipe !${prompt}
Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt};Ensuite, parlez à un mog de l'événement, et nous vous enverrons tous les deux hors de la ville, kupo !${prompt}
If you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt};Nous avons mis en place plusieurs points de contrôle à l'extérieur.${prompt}
Kupopo!;Le but est de trouver le bon, kupo !${prompt}
The Sunbreeze Festival's main event is back and better than ever!${prompt};Quoi ? Vous voulez un indice pour vous aider à trouver votre point de contrôle ? Ne craignez rien, kupo, c'est là que la boussole portable d'Azima entre en jeu !${prompt}
And this time, it's called Azimuth Circle...II!${prompt};Et c'est très facile à utiliser ! Tout ce que les aventuriers ont à faire est de s'asseoir et d'attendre !${prompt}
Would you like to know more, kupo?${prompt};Une fois la boussole stabilisée, elle vous donnera un indice pour vous aider à trouver le point de contrôle de votre partenaire, kupo.${prompt}
Want to know more?;Mais faites attention à ne pas trop vous détendre ! Juste s'asseoir et regarder les nuages ne vous aidera pas du tout, kupo. Vous devez vous concentrer comme vous le faites lorsque vous guérissez vos blessures !${prompt}
${selection-lines};Et gardez à l'esprit que vous n'apprendrez que des informations sur le point de contrôle de votre partenaire.${prompt}
Fill me in!;Alors aidez-vous mutuellement et rien ne devrait mal tourner !${prompt}
I'm okay for now, kupo.${prompt};Une fois que vous avez atteint votre point de contrôle, vous devriez y trouver quelque chose d'enfoui qui prouvera que vous y êtes arrivé ! Vous et votre partenaire devriez échanger vos objets entre vous, puis les remettre à un mog, kupo !${prompt}
To play Azimuth Circle II, you'll need to team up with a partner and use a compass to search for a specific point.${prompt};C'est tout ce qu'il y a à faire, kupo ! Vous recevrez un prix si vous réussissez, alors j'espère que vous ferez de votre mieux !${prompt}
So your first step is to find that special somebody and form a party!${prompt};Vous aurez besoin d'un partenaire, alors revenez quand vous en aurez un !${prompt}
Then talk to an event moogle, and we'll send you both out of town, kupo!${prompt};Trois, c'est une foule, kupo ! Je cherche des équipes de deux, pas plus !${prompt}
We've set up several checkpoints outside.${prompt};Voulez-vous sortir et essayer l'événement avec la personne avec qui vous êtes en équipe maintenant ?${prompt}
The goal is to find the correct one, kupo!${prompt};Est-ce que ce partenaire vous convient ?
What's that? You want a hint to help you find your checkpoint? Never fear, kupo--that's where Azima's portable compass comes in!${prompt};${selection-lines}
And it couldn't be easier to use! All the adventurers have to do is sit there and wait!${prompt};Parfait !
Once the compass has stabilized, it will give you a hint to help you find your partner's checkpoint, kupo.${prompt};Je veux aller avec quelqu'un d'autre...${prompt}
But be careful not to relax too much! Just sitting there staring at the clouds won't help you at all, kupo. You have to concentrate the way you do when healing your wounds!${prompt};Revenez quand vous aurez décidé d'un partenaire, kupo !${prompt}
And keep in mind that you will only learn about your partner's checkpoint.${prompt};Kupo ?
So help each other out and nothing should go wrong!${prompt};Où est passé votre partenaire ?${prompt}
Once you reach your checkpoint, you should find something buried there that will prove that you made it! You and your partner should trade your items with each other and then hand them to a moogle, kupo!${prompt};J'espère que vous apprécierez l'événement ensemble, kupo ! Quand vous serez tous les deux prêts, parlez simplement à l'un de nous, les mogs, pour commencer !${prompt}
That's all there is to it, kupo! You'll get a prize if you succeed, so I hope you do well!${prompt};J'attendrai ici, alors faites-le moi savoir quand vous serez prêts, kupo.${prompt}
You'll need a partner, so come back when you have one!${prompt};Kupopo ! Félicitations !
Three makes a crowd, kupo! I'm looking for parties of two, and no more!${prompt};Vous étiez merveilleux ensemble ! C'est tout à vous maintenant, kupo...${prompt}
Do you want to go outside and try the event with the person you're in a party with now?${prompt};Kupo ? Ce n'est pas l'objet de votre partenaire ! Échangez d'abord avec votre partenaire, et donnez-moi son objet !${prompt}
Is this partner okay with you?;Nous attendons juste votre partenaire maintenant, kupo ! Ou voudriez-vous annuler votre participation ?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Votre partenaire n'est pas encore prêt, kupo. Mais j'attendrai.${prompt}
Perfect!;Il semble que votre partenaire ne veuille pas encore y aller. Faites-le moi savoir quand il sera prêt, kupo.${prompt}
I want to go with someone else...${prompt};Êtes-vous prêts maintenant, kupo ?${prompt}
Come back when you've decided on a partner, kupo!${prompt};Quitter la ville ?
Kupo?;${selection-lines}
Where'd your partner go?${prompt};Envoyez-moi dehors !
I hope you enjoy the event together, kupo! When both of you are ready, just talk to one of us moogles to start!${prompt};Pas encore...${prompt}
I'll be waiting here, so just let me know when you're prepared, kupo.${prompt};Oh, vous portez tous les deux des yukata ! Vous devez être prêts pour un vrai défi, kupo ! Ne vous inquiétez pas, cependant, le prix en vaut la peine !${prompt}
Kupopo! Congratulations!;Kupo ? Ce n'est pas le partenaire que vous aviez avant ! Changer de partenaire en cours de jeu est contre les règles, kupo.${prompt}
You were wonderful together! This is all yours now, kupo...${prompt};Si vous voulez jouer avec une autre personne, vous devriez parler à l'un de nous, les mogs, et recommencer le jeu !${prompt}
Kupo? This isn't your partner's item! Trade with your partner first, and give their item to me!${prompt};Je ne peux donner à chaque personne qu'un seul objet par jour !${prompt}
We're just waiting on your partner now, kupo! Or would you like to cancel your participation?${prompt};Plus tard, je vérifierai que vous avez tous les deux trouvé vos points de contrôle. Je vous donnerai aussi ce glyphe de porte pour que vous puissiez retourner en ville, kupo !${prompt}
Your partner isn't ready yet, kupo. I'll wait, though.${prompt};Kupo ? Vous avez déjà ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...${prompt}
It looks like your partner doesn't want to go yet. Just let me know when your partner is ready, kupo.${prompt};Kupo ! J'ai presque oublié la chose la plus importante de toutes ! Tenez, prenez ceci !${prompt}
Are you ready now, kupo?${prompt};${color-alt: 15}Le mog donne à ${name-player} une petite boussole faite d’un minerai scintillant.
Leave town?;Si vous parvenez tous les deux à trouver vos points de contrôle, je vous donnerai une récompense... Alors faites de votre mieux, kupo ! ${prompt}
${selection-lines};Quoi ? Vous avez trouvé une poupée, kupo ? Alors échangez-la avec votre partenaire et donnez-la à l'un de nous, les mogs !${prompt}
Send me out!;Désolé, mais si vous n'atteignez pas le point de contrôle vous-même, je ne peux pas donner de récompense, kupo...${prompt}
Not yet...${prompt};On dirait que vous n'avez pas réussi... Bonne chance la prochaine fois, d'accord, kupo ? Je vais reprendre la boussole maintenant...${prompt}
Oh, you're both wearing yukata! You must be ready for a real challenge, kupo! Don't worry, though--the prize is worth it!${prompt};Bonne chance la prochaine fois, d'accord, kupo ? Je vais reprendre la boussole maintenant...${prompt}
Kupo? That's not the partner you were with before! Changing partners in the middle of the game is against the rules, kupo.${prompt};${color-alt: 15}${name-player} rend la boussole au mog.
If you want to play with a different person, you should talk to one of us moogles and start the game over!${prompt};Vous savez maintenant quoi faire : relevez-vous et essayez à nouveau ! Faites-le moi savoir si vous vous sentez prêts, kupo.${prompt}
I can only give each person one item a day!${prompt};Que se passe-t-il ? Voulez-vous recommencer ?${prompt}
Later, I'll check to make sure you both found your checkpoints. I'll also give you this gate glyph so you can return to town, kupo!${prompt};Recommencer ?
Kupo? You already have ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}...${prompt};${selection-lines}
Kupo! I almost forgot the most important thing of all! Here, take this!${prompt};Oui, s'il vous plaît.
${color-alt: 15}The moogle hands ${name-player} a small compass made from scintillant ore.;Non, merci.${prompt}
If you both manage to find your checkpoints, I'll give you a reward... So do your best, kupo! ${prompt};Répandez-vous la joie parmi les enfants de Vana'diel ?
What? You found a doll, kupo? Then trade it with your partner and give it to one of us moogles!${prompt};Hé, je peux vous dire quelque chose que vous devriez savoir !${prompt}
Sorry, but if you don't reach the checkpoint yourself, I can't give out a reward, kupo...${prompt};Écoutez bien ! Pour rendre les enfants heureux, vous devez... leur offrir des cadeaux !
Looks like you weren't successful... Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...${prompt};Vous devriez bien réfléchir à ce que vous allez leur donner ! On dit que c'est l'intention qui compte, mais malheureusement, les enfants pensent autrement !${prompt}
Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...${prompt};Vous devriez aussi porter un chapeau rouge comme celui que je porte maintenant ! Cela prouvera que vous êtes un joyeux dispensateur, alors les enfants ne penseront pas que vous êtes un creep.${prompt}
${color-alt: 15}${name-player} returns the compass to the moogle.;Où pouvez-vous trouver un chapeau ? Eh bien, j'ai vu quelqu'un en vendre par ici plus tôt. Je suis sûr que vous pouvez les trouver si vous cherchez !${prompt}
You know what to do now--get right back on your feet and try again! Just let me know if you're feeling up for it, kupo.${prompt};${choice: 1}[Vous n’avez apporté aucun bonheur aux enfants !/Vous avez fait du bon travail./Vous avez fait plutôt bien./Vous avez donné beaucoup de joie aux enfants !/Vous avez apporté sourire après sourire aux enfants !/Vous avez les enfants éclatant de joie !/Les enfants vous adorent !] ${choice: 1}[Quelle déception./Il vous suffit de faire un petit effort supplémentaire !/Continuez comme ça !/Vous faites un bon dispensateur de sourires./Excellent travail !/Travail stupéfiant !/Même moi, je vous trouve génial !]${prompt}
What is it? Do you want to start over?${prompt};Vous pouvez faire bon usage de la joie que vous avez apportée pour vous transporter dans une autre nation. Les enfants d'autres régions de Vana'diel ont aussi besoin de sourires !${prompt}
Start over?;Se transporter dans une autre nation ?
${selection-lines};${selection-lines}
Yes, please.;Pas maintenant.
No thanks.${prompt};Aller à San d'Oria.
Are you spreading joy to the children of Vana'diel?;Aller à Bastok.
Hey, I can tell you something you should know!${prompt};Aller à Windurst.${prompt}
Listen close, now! To make the children happy you must...give them presents!;À plus !${prompt}
You should think hard about what to get them! You might say it's the thought that counts, but unfortunately, the children think otherwise!${prompt};Désolé, mais il semble que vous n'ayez pas assez de joie et de bonheur dans votre vie pour faire cela. Vous pouvez en gagner en offrant des cadeaux aux enfants, cependant !${prompt}
You should also wear a red hat like the one I have on now! It'll prove you're a smilebringer, so the kids won't think you're a creep.${prompt};Laissez-nous ce tas de bois de chauffage futur, kupo ! Tout ce dont nous avons besoin de votre part, c’est de quelques ${color: 5}acclamations${color: 1} !${prompt}
Where can you find a hat? Well, I saw someone selling them around here earlier. I'm sure you can find them if you look!${prompt};Nous devons chasser ce monstre hors de la ville, kupo ! Les mogs feront tout le travail. Tout ce que vous avez à faire, c’est de nous ${color: 5}encourager${color: 1} !${prompt}
${choice: 1}[You haven't brought any happiness to the children!/You've done some good./You have done fairly well./You have given the children much joy!/You have brought smile upon smile to the children!/You have the children bursting with glee!/The children love you!] ${choice: 1}[What a disappointment./You just need to give a little extra effort!/Keep it up!/You make a good smilebringer./Excellent work!/Stupendous job!/Even I think you're great!]${prompt};Méchant arbre ! Méchant arbre !
You can make good use of some of that joy you've brought to transport yourself to another nation. The children in other parts of Vana'diel need smiles, too!${prompt};Merci, tout le monde !
Transport to another nation?;Continuez comme ça et il n'y a aucun moyen que nous perdions, kupo !${prompt}
${selection-lines};10000... 15000... 30000 !
Not now.;L'arbre gagne trop de puissance ! Cela ne semble pas bon, kupo !${prompt}
Go to San d'Oria.;Unnnnnngh... Méchant arbre !
Go to Bastok.;Nous ne vous laisserons pas entraver nos plans cette fois-ci, kupo !${prompt}
Go to Windurst.${prompt};Nnngahhh, kupo! Je ne peux pas le retenir!${prompt}
See ya!${prompt};Le Treant Scintillant verse une larme solitaire en disparaissant dans le néant...${prompt}
Sorry, but it looks like you don't have enough joy and happiness in your life to do that. You can earn some by giving presents to children, though!${prompt};Eh bien, c'était intéressant. Qui aurait pensé qu'un de nos arbres de festival se mettrait à marcher? Je suis juste content que ce soit fini.${prompt}
Leave this heap of future firewood to us, kupo! All we need from you is a couple ${color: 5}cheers${color: 1}!${prompt};Cependant, il y a quelque chose qui me dérange toujours... C'est comme un nuage sombre qui plane au-dessus de notre belle ville...${prompt}
We have to run this monster out of town, kupo! The moogles will do all the work. All you have to do is ${color: 5}cheer${color: 1} us along!${prompt};"J'ai été tellement occupé à combattre les treants et à répandre l'amour auprès des enfants que ce n'est que récemment que j'ai entendu les rumeurs des ""autres"" apporteurs de sourires...${prompt}"
Bad tree! Bad tree!;Je ne sais pas ce que ces imposteurs mijotent, mais s'ils pensent ne serait-ce qu'à toucher aux enfants innocents de la ville...${prompt}
Thanks, everybody!;Je déteste demander cela à un étranger, mais vous avez l'air d'être quelqu'un en qui je peux avoir confiance. Pourriez-vous avoir la gentillesse de rechercher le faux apporteur de sourires et de me l'amener pour que nous puissions régler toute cette histoire?${prompt}
Keep it up and there's no way we can lose, kupo!${prompt};Vous êtes de retour ! Avez-vous pu trouver l'imposteur?${prompt}
10000... 15000... 30000!;Vous l'avez localisé, mais il a réussi à s'échapper? Eh bien, je suppose que c'est mieux que rien. Maintenant qu'il sait que nous sommes sur ses traces, peut-être qu'il cessera de s'en prendre aux enfants du Royaume.${prompt}
The tree is gaining too much power! This doesn't look good, kupo!${prompt};J'ai entendu d'un autre aimable aventurier que le faux apporteur de sourires distribuait des boîtes étranges aux jeunes... Pourquoi, pour tout ce que je sais, il pourrait y avoir des scorpions vivants cachés dans ces paquets, juste en attente de piquer les petits bouts de nez de tous mes petits amis.${prompt}
Unnnnnngh... Bad tree!;Vous ne savez pas à quel point votre gentillesse signifie pour moi. Vous êtes un peu trop vieux pour être mon ami, mais j'aimerais que vous ayez ceci en signe de mon appréciation.${prompt}
We won't let you get in the way of our plans this time, kupo!${prompt};Wow! C'était plutôt effrayant. Je suis tout pour les droits des arbres et tout ça, mais une fois que ces gars-là commencent à se promener dans ma ville...${prompt}
Nnngahhh, kupo! I can't hold him back!${prompt};Coupez-les en morceaux et jetez-les sur le feu de camp, c'est ce que je dis. Le seul bon arbre est celui qui fait griller mon marshmallow.${prompt}
The Twinkling Treant sheds a solitary tear as it fades into nothingness...${prompt};Oh oui, je voulais vous demander quelque chose avant que vous ne m'interrompiez.${prompt}
Well, that was interesting. Who would have thought that one of our festival trees would just get up and start walking around? I'm just glad that it is all over.${prompt};Il y a ces étranges nains qui courent en ville en prétendant qu'ils sont des apporteurs de sourires comme moi.${prompt}
However, there is something that still bothers me... It is like a dark cloud hanging over our fair city...${prompt};J'ai eu les mains tellement pleines à courir après les arbres ambulants que je n'ai pas pu enquêter. Pour compenser le fait de m'avoir interrompu, pourriez-vous aller voir si vous pouvez trouver des informations juteuses sur les faux?${prompt}
I've been so busy fighting treants and spreading love to the children, that it wasn't until recently that I heard the rumors of the “other” smilebringers...${prompt};Je serai juste ici à protéger la fontaine contre d'autres attaques de treants. Faites-le moi savoir dès que vous aurez appris quelque chose d'utile.${prompt}
I don't know what these imposters are cooking up, but if they are even thinking of laying a finger on the city's innocent children...${prompt};Qui est-tu, kewpo ?
I hate to ask this of a stranger, but you look like someone I can trust. Would you please be so kind as to search out the false smilebringer and bring him to me so we can straighten this whole mess out?${prompt};Je ne fais rien de mal ici, tu vois ? J'apporte des sourires aux gentils garçons et filles, kewpo ! Passe ton chemin ! Passe ton chemin !${prompt}
You're back! Were you able to find the imposter?${prompt};Ummm...
You located him, but he managed to escape? Well, I guess that is better than nothing. Now that he knows we are on to him, perhaps he will cease to prey on the Kingdom's children.${prompt};Je peux expliquer, kewpo...${prompt}
I heard from another kind adventurer that the false smilebringer was passing out strange-looking boxes to the young ones... Why, for all I know, there could be live scorpions hiding in those packages, just waiting to sting the cute little button noses of all my little friends.${prompt};Juste pas aujourd'hui !
You don't know how much your kindness means to me. You're a little old to be my friend, but I'd like you to have this as a token of my appreciation.${prompt};Kew-pooooooooo !${prompt}
Wow! That was pretty frightening. I'm all for tree's rights and everything, but once those guys start walking around my town...${prompt};De retour enfin. Avez-vous appris quelque chose qui vaille la peine de partager mon attention partiellement divisée?${prompt}
Chop 'em up and toss them on the campfire, that's what I say. The only good tree is the one toasting my marshmallow.${prompt};Uh-huh...
Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you something before you interrupted me there.${prompt};Donc vous l'avez laissé s'échapper... Eh bien, je suppose que c'est ce que je mérite pour avoir fait confiance à un amateur. Ma faute, ma faute.${prompt}
There are these strange midgets running around town claiming that they're smilebringers just like me.${prompt};Un de mes autres contacts m'a dit que le petit gars distribuait une sorte de pâtisserie étrange à tous les enfants. Jusqu'à présent, je n'ai pas entendu parler de cas de diarrhée, mais la journée est encore jeune.${prompt}
I've had my hands so full chasing around the walking trees that I haven't been able to investigate. How about to make up for interrupting me back there, you go and see if you can find any juicy info on the fakes?${prompt};Je suppose que le fait de l'avoir effrayé mettra fin à ce fiasco, mais nous ne pouvons pas en être sûrs à cent pour cent. Gardez un œil sur ce fléau et la prochaine fois, ne le laissez pas s'échapper !${prompt}
I'll be right here protecting the fountain from any more treant attacks. Let me know the moment you've learned something worthwhile.${prompt};Quoi ?
Who the kewpo are you, kewpo?;Vous voulez quelque chose pour m'avoir aidé ? Eh bien, c'est la célébration de la Starlight. Pourquoi pas ? Vous ne récoltez que ce que vous semez, non ?${prompt}
I'm nothing doing wrong here, see? I'm smilebringing to nice boys and girls, kewpo! Move along! Move along!${prompt};Arrrg, cet arbre ambulant a failli marcher sur moi et mon perroquet ! Un pas de plus et je me faisais une nouvelle jambe de bois avec sa tête.${prompt}
Ummm...;Oui, parlant de jambes de bois, il y a ce drôle de loustic qui rôde à Windurst en prétendant être un apporteur de sourires. Qu'est-ce que ça a à voir avec les jambes de bois ? Arrrg, ne t'en soucie pas.${prompt}
I can explaining, kewpo...${prompt};Tu n'as qu'à te soucier du fait que cet imposteur empiète sur mon territoire${prompt}
Just not today!;Personne, même pas Davy Jones, n'a le droit de jeter l'ancre dans mon port sans ma permission expresse.${prompt}
Kew-pooooooooo!${prompt};Arrrg, tu as l'air d'une âme digne de confiance. Pourrais-tu trouver en ton cœur d'aider un pirate en détresse ?${prompt}
Back at last. Did you learn anything worth my partially divided attention?${prompt};J'ai un mauvais pressentiment au sujet de cet arbre, et je veux être là si quelque chose tourne mal.${prompt}
Uh-huh...;Arrrg, as-tu trouvé ce scélérat et l'as-tu fait marcher sur la planche?${prompt}
So you let the thing get away... Well, I guess that's what I get for relying on an amateur. My bad, my bad.${prompt};Tu dis qu'il a juste disparu, hein ? Eh bien, je suppose que tu n'es pas à blâmer.${prompt}
One of my other contacts told me that the little spud was passing out some strange kind of pastry to all the kids. So far I haven't heard of any diarrhea breakouts, but the day is still young.${prompt};Un de mes autres matelots a dit qu'ils ont vu le faux apporteur de sourires se promener comme une marionnette et distribuer des cadeaux étranges aux enfants.${prompt}
I guess your scaring him off will put an end to this fiasco, but we can't be one hundred percent sure. Keep your eyes out for that pest and next time don't let him escape!${prompt};Mais maintenant que tu l'as effrayé, la ville devrait être en sécurité.
What?;Tiens, prends ce butin. Tu l'as bien mérité, matelot !${prompt}
You want something for helping me out? Well, it is the Starlight Celebration. Why not? You only get what you give, right?${prompt};Kupopopo～ !
Arrrg, that there walkin' tree almost stepped on me and me parrot! One step closer and I'd be makin' meself a new peg leg out of its head.${prompt};C'est terrible !
Aye, speakin' o' peg legs, there be this mighty fishy landlubber swaggerin' 'round Windurs' posin' as a smilebringer. What's that got t' do with peg legs? Arrrg, never ye mind.${prompt};Quelques crapules sournoises ont encore volé les armures que nous avions apportées pour la Fête des Épées... kupo !${prompt}
Ye only needs t' concern yerself with the fact that this imposter is encroachin' on me territory${prompt};Comme vous le savez probablement, les bandits qui portent ces armures sont invulnérables aux armes normales ! Et comme si ça ne suffisait pas, ils sont entourés d'une puissante aura qui les rend intouchables, kupo !${prompt}
Nobody, not even Davy Jones, has the right t' drop his anchor in me harbor without me express permission.${prompt};Mais ne vous inquiétez pas !
Arrrg, ye looks like a trustworthy soul. Could ye find it in yer heart t' help out a fellow pirate in need?${prompt};Les moogles nomades ont aussi développé une magie qui annulera cette aura anti-attaque. Assurez-vous de leur rendre visite tout en portant l'arme avant d'affronter l'ennemi, kupo.${prompt}
I've got a bad feelin' 'bout that tree, an' I want t' be 'round if anythin' goes awry.${prompt};Mais attention -- cette magie a pour effet secondaire de vous empêcher d'attaquer tout autre monstre pendant trois jours vana'dieliens entiers, kupo !${prompt}
Arrrg, did ye find that scurvy dawg an' make 'im walk the plank?${prompt};Et ce n'est pas tout !
Ye say he just up an' vanished, now do ye? Well, I guess yer not t' blame.${prompt};Cette fois, nous voulons nous assurer que ces voleurs misérables auront du mal à revenir, kupo !${prompt}
One of me other mateys said they saw the rotten bringer prancin' round like a puppet an' passin' out strange presents t' the kiddies.${prompt};Vous voyez, même si vous en abattez un, le pouvoir de l'armure restaurera lentement sa santé, et avant que vous ne le sachiez, le coquin sera de nouveau à plein régime !${prompt}
But now that ye've frightened 'im off, the city should be safe.;C’est pourquoi nous vous conseillons de planter (${color: 5}échanger${color: 1}) votre ${item-singular: 0[2]} ou votre ${item-singular: 1[2]} près d’un malfrat abattu. Cela créera une protection qui devrait ralentir les propriétés régénératives de l’équipement, vous permettant de les vaincre à répétition, kupo !${prompt}
Here, take this bit o' plunder. Ye've earned it, matey!${prompt};Souvenez-vous simplement que plus vous vous éloignez de la protection, plus elle s’affaiblit. Nous vous recommandons de rester dans la même ${color: 5}zone${color: 1} pour de meilleurs résultats.${prompt}
Kupopopo～!;Très bien. Voici votre ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Maintenant, vous êtes prêt pour le combat, kupo !${prompt}
This is terrible!;Oh, et vous constaterez que les récompenses que nous avons pour vous cette fois-ci sont encore meilleures que les précédentes. Vous pourriez même être l'un des chanceux aventuriers à remporter un tout nouveau et chic... Ah, vous devrez le voir pour le croire, kupo !${prompt}
Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!${prompt};Maintenant, si vous voulez croiser le fer avec les intrus invincibles, équipez ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} ou ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} et parlez à un moogle nomade, kupo !${prompt}
As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!${prompt};Vana'diel est attaquée par des bandits portant nos armures de samouraï volées ! Aidez les moogles de chaque nation à vaincre cette menace, kupo !${prompt}
But never fear!;Nous avons concocté une magie moogle pour briser cette aura, mais vous devrez équiper une arme spéciale pour au moins leur causer une égratignure, kupo ! Equipez-vous, je vous le dis ! Equiiiip !${prompt}
The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.${prompt};Ce... cet ${item-singular: 0[2]}...
But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!${prompt};C'est peut-être exactement ce qu'il faut pour frapper ces samouraïs farfelus ! Tenez-vous tranquille pendant que je fais ma magie moogle, kupo !${prompt}
And that's not all!;Oh, n’oubliez pas de placer la protection avec votre ${item-singular: 0[2]} une fois que vous en avez abattu un !${prompt}
This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!${prompt};Vous pourrez vraiment blesser ces porteurs de malheur avec ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Allez, tenez-vous tranquille pendant que je fais ma magie moogle, kupo !${prompt}
You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!${prompt};Oh, n’oubliez pas de placer la protection avec votre ${item-singular: 0[2]} ou votre ${item-singular: 1[2]} une fois que vous en avez abattu un !${prompt}
That's why we want you to plant (${color: 5}trade${color: 1}) your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or ${item-singular: 1[2]} into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment's regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!${prompt};"Et quoi que vous fassiez, ne vous éloignez pas trop de la zone ; vos protections fatiguées s’affaibliront, kupo !${prompt}"
Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same ${color: 5}area${color: 1} for best results.${prompt};Non, non, non ! Cet ${item-singular: 1[2]} est beaucoup trop tranchant ! Pensez aux dégâts qu’il pourrait causer à l’armure innocente ! Allez, allez chercher ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} ou ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} et revenez vite, kupo !${prompt}
Alright. Here's your ${item-singular: 0[2]}. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!${prompt};Bien joué !
Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!${prompt};Passons au suivant, kupo !${prompt}
Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!${prompt};Ce voleur a déjà été affaibli par une protection. Essayez d'en trouver un qui ne l'ait pas été, kupo !${prompt}
Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!${prompt};Merveilleux ! Voici votre récompense, kupo !
We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!${prompt};Si vous êtes toujours partant, pourquoi ne pas sortir et en frapper quelques autres ?${prompt}
Th-that ${item-singular: 0[2]}...;Incroyable ! Maintenant, peut-être que ces commerçants d'Extrême-Orient ne nous mélangeront pas en hachis moogle ! Voici votre récompense, kupo !${prompt}
It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt};J-je suis sans voix ! Nous ne pensions pas que quelqu'un pourrait rivaliser d'ingéniosité avec cette menace mithra ! Voici votre récompense, kupo !${prompt}
Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} when you've defeated one!${prompt};L'ombre du voleur plane toujours sur l'armure...${prompt}
You'll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!${prompt};L'ombre du voleur a presque disparu complètement.${prompt}
Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your ${item-singular: 0[2]} or your ${item-singular: 1[2]} when you've defeated one!${prompt};Hé ${choice-player-gender}[monsieur/madame], arrêtez-vous là !
"And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!${prompt}";Êtes-vous un “aventurier” ?${prompt}
No, no, no! That ${item-singular: 1[2]} is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and hurry back, kupo!${prompt};Alors, avouez.
Well done!;${selection-lines}
On to the next one, kupo!${prompt};Oui, c'est moi.
That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!${prompt};Pas du tout !${prompt}
Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo!;C'est bien ce que je pensais !
If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?${prompt};Tenez, mettez ceci vite !
Unbelievable! Now, maybe those Far Eastern traders won't mix us up into moogle mincemeat! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt};Heheh !${prompt}
I-I'm speechless! We didn't think anyone could match wits with that Mithra menace! Here's your reward, kupo!${prompt};Pas du tout !?
The shadow of the thief still lingers within the armor...${prompt};M-mais... ça vous irait tellement bien ! Tenez, prenez-le !
The thief's shadow has almost disappeared completely.${prompt};Heheh !${prompt}
Hey ${choice-player-gender}[mister/lady], hold it right there!;${color-alt: 15}Ibwam vous accroche le ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} sans que vous vous en rendiez compte...${prompt}
Are you an “adventurer”?${prompt};Maintenant, vous avez la classe !
${selection-lines};Vous voyez comment ce badge est en forme de tête de félin ? C'est la marque de notre compagnie de mercenaires, les “Sentinelles de Salaheem” !${prompt}
Yes, I am.;Notre compagnie est hautement renommée pour son excellence en Orient, où nous sommes officiellement approuvés par l'Empire !
No way!${prompt};C'est juste que personne là-bas ne veut se joindre à nous... Euh, que disais-je !? Ah oui, nous recrutons actuellement !${prompt}
That's what I thought!;Nous accueillerions à bras ouverts un aventurier robuste comme vous !
Here, put this on, quick!;Hé, pourquoi n'iriez-vous pas en parler à tous vos amis ? Merci ! Allez-y maintenant !${prompt}
Heheh!${prompt};Hé, écoutez ! Écoutez !
No way!?;Les gens s'intéressent aux Sentinelles de Salaheem ! C'est fantastique !${prompt}

Fine. When ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?${prompt};Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to see it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?${prompt}
Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. Sorry...${prompt};Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms.${prompt}
Is that so? That's a good attitude to have...${prompt};Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.${prompt}
...;Parting with your chocobo is difficult, isn't it? Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Don't look so down.${prompt}
I'm disappointed in you.${prompt};I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to your chocobo. Don't worry, though...you can see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Don't look so down.${prompt}
Some excuse... You haven't even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt}
No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.${prompt};A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.${prompt}
We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse.${prompt};Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt}
Of course not! Keep up the good work with your chocobo, all right?${prompt};You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.${prompt}
You really want to retire ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}?${prompt};You can register a retired chocobo by trading ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to me.${prompt}
Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to see it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?${prompt};All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready.${prompt}
Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms.${prompt};All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready as soon as it returns.${prompt}
Understood. ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.${prompt};I will now register ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} to come when you call.${prompt}
Parting with your chocobo is difficult, isn't it? Don't worry, though...you can see it again. Don't look so down.${prompt};I'll take ${number: 0} gil for the preparations.${prompt}
I'm sure it must be difficult not being able to say goodbye to your chocobo. Don't worry, though...you can see ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} again. Don't look so down.${prompt};I've got your ${item-singular: 0[2]} right here. You can have it now.${prompt}
I cannot issue any documents to a chocobo that has not been named.${prompt};You lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}
A chococard contains all the vital information about the chocobo that you are raising.${prompt};Well, I guess I'll have to get another one from Hantileon. It's going to cost you ${number: 1} gil, though.${prompt}
Trade a chococard to the matchmaker in Jeuno, and you will be able to breed your animal with another chocobo. I can issue a chococard for ${number: 0} gil.${prompt};This item links you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} together. You would be wise not to lose it again.${prompt}
You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};It looks like you're taking good care of this. There seems to be no problem.${prompt}
Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.${prompt};This ${item-singular: 2[2]}'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.${prompt}
You can register a retired chocobo by trading ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} to me.${prompt};I can give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for it if you wish.${prompt}
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready.${prompt};Here you go. Take good care of it.${prompt}
All right, then. I'll get ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} ready as soon as it returns.${prompt};All right... You can have this back, then.${prompt}
I will now register ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} to come when you call.${prompt};Let me give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for this old one.${prompt}
I'll take ${number: 0} gil for the preparations.${prompt};And don't worry about the usual fee. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is all I need from you this time.${prompt}
I've got your ${item-singular: 0[2]} right here. You can have it now.${prompt};I still haven't given your chocobo it's food, so I will return it to you.${prompt}
You lost your ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.${prompt}
Well, I guess I'll have to get another one from Hantileon. It's going to cost you ${number: 1} gil, though.${prompt};Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.${prompt}
This item links you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} together. You would be wise not to lose it again.${prompt};Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.${prompt}
It looks like you're taking good care of this. There seems to be no problem.${prompt};Alright. Let's give ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} its food.${prompt}
This ${item-singular: 2[2]}'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.${prompt};I hope it gets well soon.${prompt}
I can give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for it if you wish.${prompt};I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo.${prompt}
Here you go. Take good care of it.${prompt};I hope your chocobo awakens soon.${prompt}
All right... You can have this back, then.${prompt};Ah, ${name-player}.
Let me give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for this old one.${prompt};I've been waiting for you. You can have this.${prompt}
And don't worry about the usual fee. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is all I need from you this time.${prompt};To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
I still haven't given your chocobo it's food, so I will return it to you.${prompt};You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.${prompt}
Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.${prompt};Hello, ${name-player}...
Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.${prompt};What's all this about?${prompt}
Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.${prompt};I see...
Alright. Let's give ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} its food.${prompt};So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.${prompt}
I hope it gets well soon.${prompt};${name-player}, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.${prompt}
I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo.${prompt};I'm sure its owner is searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.${prompt}
I hope your chocobo awakens soon.${prompt};If you discover anything, have Gonija take down the details.${prompt}
Ah, ${name-player}.;${name-player}, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I've been collecting information myself, too...${prompt}
I've been waiting for you. You can have this.${prompt};The owner's name starts with the letter ${choice: 0}[ / / /D/G/A].${prompt}
To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};The owner is ${choice: 0}[ / / / /a Galka/a Hume woman/a Hume man/an old Hume woman].${prompt}
You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.${prompt};The owner is ${choice: 0}[ /a watchman/ /a merchant/a miner/a guild worker].${prompt}
Hello, ${name-player}...;I'll search too when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.${prompt}
What's all this about?${prompt};I've found more information on the lost chick's owner.${prompt}
I see...;That's all I could find. The rest is up to you.${prompt}
So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.${prompt};The chick's owner came and picked it up not long ago. I'm glad we found its rightful home.${prompt}
${name-player}, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.${prompt};I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.${prompt}
I'm sure its owner is searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.${prompt};Hmm...
If you discover anything, have Gonija take down the details.${prompt};I believe that name violates the VCS naming conventions.
${name-player}, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I've been collecting information myself, too...${prompt};You'll need to choose something different, I'm afraid.${prompt}
The owner's name starts with the letter ${choice: 0}[ / / /D/G/A].${prompt};Lately, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been crying loud enough at night to wake the dead!${prompt}
The owner is ${choice: 0}[ / / / /a Galka/a Hume woman/a Hume man/an old Hume woman].${prompt};I know chicks cry a lot, but this is the worst...${prompt}
The owner is ${choice: 0}[ /a watchman/ /a merchant/a miner/a guild worker].${prompt};I know! Could you hold on to this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for a while?${prompt}
I'll search too when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.${prompt};Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.${prompt}
I've found more information on the lost chick's owner.${prompt};That should be enough! Hand over the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} now.${prompt}
That's all I could find. The rest is up to you.${prompt};Hm...yes...${chocobo-name: 0[2]} should be able to sleep well with this...${prompt}
The chick's owner came and picked it up not long ago. I'm glad we found its rightful home.${prompt};Thanks to the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been sleeping like a baby!${prompt}
I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.${prompt};I haven't seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep better.${prompt}
Hmm...;I'll get rid of this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for you. No need to thank me! I'm just that kind of gal!${prompt}
I believe that name violates the VCS naming conventions.;${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride!${prompt}
You'll need to choose something different, I'm afraid.${prompt};${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs!${prompt}
Lately, ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has been crying loud enough at night to wake the dead!${prompt};${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak!${prompt}

I haven't seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep better.${prompt};You'll need ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} in order to call it in the field. Sorry, but you have to go aaall the way to the chocobo stables in San d'Oria to get one!${prompt}
I'll get rid of this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} for you. No need to thank me! I'm just that kind of gal!${prompt};You just gave me an egg! I can't take care of two at once!${prompt}
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride!${prompt};I can't take that egg! You're already raising a chocobo!${prompt}
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs!${prompt};I can't take your egg because you're raising a chocobo at another nation's stables!${prompt}
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak!${prompt};So this is the egg you want to raise, is it?${prompt}

${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at that fine beak and graceful plumage!${prompt};Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause problems when the chocobo matures and it comes time to fill out important paperwork!${prompt}
${chocobo-name: 0[2]} has finally grown large enough to ride! Just look at those sturdy legs, that fine beak...and what graceful plumage!${prompt};Just look at that color! It won't be long until ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} is fully grown!${prompt}

A chick has hatched from the egg!${prompt};${chocobo-name: 0[2]}!${prompt}
It's sooo cute! Let's name it later, okay?${prompt};Your chocobo seems to like its new name.${prompt}
Sometimes people forget to name their chocobo, but this can cause problems when the chocobo matures and it comes time to fill out important paperwork!${prompt};I'm sorry, but the time has come to part with ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}! It will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society farms.${prompt}

Here, let me give you a new ${item-singular: 2[2]} in exchange for this old one.${prompt};I've been waiting for you. You can have this.${prompt}
And don't worry about the usual fee. The ${item-singular: 0[2]} is all I'll be needing from you this time.${prompt};To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
I still have not given your chocobo its food, so I will return it to you.${prompt};You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.${prompt}
Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.${prompt};Hi, ${name-player}!
Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.${prompt};What's all this about?${prompt}
Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.${prompt};I see...
Alright. Let's give ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} its food.${prompt};So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.${prompt}
I hope it gets well soon.${prompt};${name-player}, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.${prompt}
I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo!${prompt};I'm sure its owner is searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.${prompt}
I hope your chocobo awakens soon.${prompt};If you find anything, have a chat to Kiria-Romaria over there.${prompt}
Ah, ${name-player}!;${name-player}, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I've been collecting information, too!${prompt}

${name-player}, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I've been collecting information, too!${prompt};You'll have to choose another one, I'm afraid.${prompt}
The owner's name starts with the letter ${choice: 0}[ / / / /G/ /K/P].${prompt};First, we must test the level of trust between you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}.${prompt}
The owner is ${choice: 0}[/ / / / / / / /a Tarutaru man/a Tarutaru woman/a Mithra].${prompt};Chocobos have a habit of hiding things that they consider valuable.${prompt}
The owner is ${choice: 0}[ / / / / /a guild worker/someone affiliated with one of the ministries/a hunter/an adventurer].${prompt};I'm sure even ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} hides things while you are not around...${prompt}

I've got new information on the owner of the lost chick!${prompt};If you and ${chocobo-name: 0[2]} really have a trusting relationship, I'm sure you will be able to find something.${prompt}

Whenever I take my chocobo on a walk, I also bring along a Cardian to make sure nobody gets lost! I'm afraid you've got the wrong guy.${prompt};You're looking at the highest-ranking mid-level journeyman in the VCS. You don't know what that means? It doesn't matter.

You say you've got my chocobo?${prompt};Treasure, matey! Gil with a capital G. Rrrich stuff so rrrich you'll have to hide it in your underwear if you want to keep it safe.${prompt}

You say you've got my chocobo?${prompt};Well, all those extra birds have the local trainers busier than bees at a honey convention.${prompt}
I'm a rrranger, so I know how terrifying monsters can be. I would never take my eyes off a poor defenseless chocobo while we're on a walk! You must have the wrrrong person.${prompt};I've started hearing rumors that a lot of the stables don't have time to give proper attention to all the chocobos in their care, leaving a lot of the birds weak and hungrrry.${prompt}
You say you've got me chocobo?${prompt};(One guy even told me that the stables here have been selling extra birds to the Timbre Timbers...if you know what I mean!)${prompt}
I'm afraid you've got the wrong person.

Sorry, but you've got the wrong gal. I'd never be able to work this well if my prrrecious chocobo was missing!${prompt};And that brings me back to why the VCS sent me here--treasure!${prompt}
Well, well, well... You think you've found my chocobo, do you?${prompt};And what does treasure have to do with saving chocobos? Everything!

Sorry to tell you, but it can't be mine. I was just playing dress-up with my chocobo just a few moments ago!${prompt};And it's called the “Chocobo Hot and Cold Game”!${prompt}
Out of all the darrrn Mithras in this darrrn town, you decided to talk to me... Well, then I must say you are off to a good start.${prompt};You love your chocobo? You love money? Well, then why not love them both at the same time by participating in this new fad that's sweeping the continent by storm?${prompt}

Treasure, matey! Gil with a capital G. Rrrich stuff so rrrich you'll have to hide it in your underwear if you want to keep it safe.${prompt};We guarantee you'll have fun or your money back! Oh, and did I mention it's frrree to participate?${prompt}
Okay, let's back up a bit. You've noticed the rrrecent influx of chocobo owners these past few moons, right?${prompt};VCS officials have been spending the past few weeks burying chests filled with tasty treats in secrrret locations all over Vana'diel.${prompt}
Well, all those extra birds have the local trainers busier than bees at a honey convention.${prompt};All you have to do is dig 'em up, and they're yours. No strings attached!${prompt}
I've started hearing rumors that a lot of the stables don't have time to give proper attention to all the chocobos in their care, leaving a lot of the birds weak and hungrrry.${prompt};What do you say?${prompt}
(One guy even told me that the stables here have been selling extra birds to the Timbre Timbers...if you know what I mean!)${prompt};Yeah, you could go out and help some lady get her husband ointment to soothe his festerrring pustules, or defeat some Shadow Lord and save the world, but deep down in your heart you know what you really want to do...${prompt}
Anyway, what I'm trying to get at is, that if we don't do something quick, Vana'diel will be crawling with chocobos so weak and slow, people will start riding rarabs instead.${prompt};Listen to your heart?
And that brings me back to why the VCS sent me here--treasure!${prompt};${selection-lines}
And what does treasure have to do with saving chocobos? Everything! After about fifty-seven meetings, the VCS officials came up with a brrrand-new activity to get your chocobo in shape, while lining your pockets with sweet loot!${prompt};Sign me up!
And it's called the “Chocobo Hot and Cold Game”!${prompt};After saving the world.${prompt}
You love your chocobo? You love money? Well, then why not love them both at the same time by participating in this new fad that's sweeping the continent by storm?${prompt};Alright, I guess everybody has their priorities. But you know where I'll be when you're finished!${prompt}
You look like you've got some time on your hands. Why not give the game a whirl? You have nothing to lose!${prompt};Rrright answer!${prompt}
We guarantee you'll have fun or your money back! Oh, and did I mention it's frrree to participate?${prompt};Wait a minute... Let me see your map collection... You don't have the complete three-nation set, do you?${prompt}

All you have to do is dig 'em up, and they're yours. No strings attached!${prompt};I'm sorry, but you'll need all three before I can let you play our game. Stop by a map vendor and pick up the ones you don't have. I'll be waiting here for you, but I can't guarantee the treasure will be...${prompt}

Yeah, you could go out and help some lady get her husband ointment to soothe his festerrring pustules, or defeat some Shadow Lord and save the world, but deep down in your heart you know what you really want to do...${prompt};What do you need to know?
Listen to your heart?;${selection-lines}
${selection-lines};About chocographs.
Sign me up!;About ${item-plural: 1[2]}.
After saving the world.${prompt};About how to find the loot.
Alright, I guess everybody has their priorities. But you know where I'll be when you're finished!${prompt};About chocobo abilities.
Rrright answer!${prompt};About when the game is over.${prompt}
Wait a minute... Let me see your map collection... You don't have the complete three-nation set, do you?${prompt};Anyone who wants to participate in the Chocobo Hot and Cold Game will require a special ${color: 5}chocograph${color: 1} authorizing ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to dig in a cerrrtain area.${prompt}
I'm talking about the ${keyitem-singular: 1[2]}, the ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]}, and the ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt};There are several kinds of chocographs for different types of treasure hidden in areas all over Vana'diel.${prompt}
I'm sorry, but you'll need all three before I can let you play our game. Stop by a map vendor and pick up the ones you don't have. I'll be waiting here for you, but I can't guarantee the treasure will be...${prompt};And once you obtain one, it's yours for life, or until you set your gobbiebag on fire.${prompt}
Okay, now I know you're all rrready to get started, but I'm required to go over the official VCS rulebook before letting you loose.${prompt};Wait... I'm picking up your thoughts... Just where do I get my hands on a chocograph?${prompt}
What do you need to know?;Well, don't you worry, because for a limited time, the VCS is giving away two chocographs absolutely frrree to the first three million adventurers who sign up!${prompt}
${selection-lines};${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} is the item that you'll need to start the game.${prompt}
About chocographs.;Take a clump to the area specified on a chocograph and set it out on the ground. Before you know it, your verrry own chocobo will come galloping gallantly to your side.${prompt}
About ${item-plural: 1[2]}.;Once it arrives, your map will open and you'll have the opportunity to confirm the general location of the burrried treasure in that area.${prompt}
About how to find the loot.;Please note that once your chocobo has gobbled up the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, you'll need to obtain another from a VCS representative before playing again.${prompt}
About chocobo abilities.;Ah yes... I knew you'd want to hear about that.
About when the game is over.${prompt};Well, first ride your chocobo out to the location indicated on your map.${prompt}
Anyone who wants to participate in the Chocobo Hot and Cold Game will require a special ${color: 5}chocograph${color: 1} authorizing ${choice-player-gender}[him/her] to dig in a cerrrtain area.${prompt};When you think you're close to where the treasure might be buried, take a test dig and see what happens.${prompt}
There are several kinds of chocographs for different types of treasure hidden in areas all over Vana'diel.${prompt};All chocobos have noses for finding burrried goods, and depending on how hot or cold you are (Get it? That's where we got the name for the game!) your steed will react differently.${prompt}
And once you obtain one, it's yours for life, or until you set your gobbiebag on fire.${prompt};The closer you are, the more drrramatic that reaction will be, so listen carefully.${prompt}
Wait... I'm picking up your thoughts... Just where do I get my hands on a chocograph?${prompt};When you think you've found the spot...${prompt}
Well, don't you worry, because for a limited time, the VCS is giving away two chocographs absolutely frrree to the first three million adventurers who sign up!${prompt};...dig and dig, and then dig some more!${prompt}
${lettercase: 1}${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} is the item that you'll need to start the game.${prompt};I'll warn you right now, but some of the loot is pretty deep, so you may have to dig multiple times beforrre you uncover any chests.${prompt}
Take a clump to the area specified on a chocograph and set it out on the ground. Before you know it, your verrry own chocobo will come galloping gallantly to your side.${prompt};But, with a little bit of luck and a lot of bits of persistence, you'll be rolling in goodies in no time!${prompt}
Once it arrives, your map will open and you'll have the opportunity to confirm the general location of the burrried treasure in that area.${prompt};That's rrright! Once you've unearthed the chest, all that's left is to open it. Whatever you find inside is yours to keep.${prompt}
Please note that once your chocobo has gobbled up the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, you'll need to obtain another from a VCS representative before playing again.${prompt};Now, to increase your chances of finding treasure, you'll want to know how chocobo abilities can give you that extrrra edge.${prompt}
Ah yes... I knew you'd want to hear about that.;The ones that will help you most are “Treasure Finder,” “Burrow,” and “Bore.”${prompt}
Well, first ride your chocobo out to the location indicated on your map.${prompt};Burrow and Bore will allow you to go deeper with each dig, helping you reach the chest beforrre your bird grows too tired.${prompt}
When you think you're close to where the treasure might be buried, take a test dig and see what happens.${prompt};Treasure Finder does just that--helps you find the treasure easierrr by honing your chocobo's sense of smell.${prompt}
All chocobos have noses for finding burrried goods, and depending on how hot or cold you are (Get it? That's where we got the name for the game!) your steed will react differently.${prompt};Alright, this part is the most important, so I'm going to need you to listen up.${prompt}
The closer you are, the more drrramatic that reaction will be, so listen carefully.${prompt};Digging for extended periods of time can rrreally drain a chocobo's strength.${prompt}
When you think you've found the spot...${prompt};Push your bird too harrrd, and it may just reach that point where it refuses to dig anymore.${prompt}
...dig and dig, and then dig some more!${prompt};When this happens, you might as well tighten the string on your gobbiebag because you won't be getting any morrre treasure that day.${prompt}
I'll warn you right now, but some of the loot is pretty deep, so you may have to dig multiple times beforrre you uncover any chests.${prompt};In other words, locating the chest in the fewest possible digs will be the key to your success.${prompt}
But, with a little bit of luck and a lot of bits of persistence, you'll be rolling in goodies in no time!${prompt};Remember that.${prompt}
That's rrright! Once you've unearthed the chest, all that's left is to open it. Whatever you find inside is yours to keep.${prompt};Okay! Now I think you're finally rrready to head out there and start digging!${prompt}
Now, to increase your chances of finding treasure, you'll want to know how chocobo abilities can give you that extrrra edge.${prompt};Let me get you your two complimentary licenses...${prompt}
The ones that will help you most are “Treasure Finder,” “Burrow,” and “Bore.”${prompt};Here's a ${keyitem-singular: 2[2]} and a ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.${prompt}
Burrow and Bore will allow you to go deeper with each dig, helping you reach the chest beforrre your bird grows too tired.${prompt};And here's your ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Treasure Finder does just that--helps you find the treasure easierrr by honing your chocobo's sense of smell.${prompt};Like I told you before, too much digging is hard on your chocobo, so the VCS prohibits me from giving adventurers too many of these ${item-plural: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Alright, this part is the most important, so I'm going to need you to listen up.${prompt};If you want any more, let your chocobo rest a while beforrre coming back, alright?${prompt}
Digging for extended periods of time can rrreally drain a chocobo's strength.${prompt};Okay. I can tell that you've heard enough from me.${prompt}
Push your bird too harrrd, and it may just reach that point where it refuses to dig anymore.${prompt};You're frrree to go! Talk to you later!${prompt}
When this happens, you might as well tighten the string on your gobbiebag because you won't be getting any morrre treasure that day.${prompt};Step rrright up, boys and girls! I can give you IX finally fantastic reasons why the Chocobo Hot and Cold Game is the most fun you'll have on the back of a giant yellow bird!${prompt}

Please come back if you ever change your mind!${prompt};Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt}
What would you like to know?;We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt}
${selection-lines};However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt}
Why race chocobos, anyway?;The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt}
How do I register for a race?;And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt}
How do I prepare for a race?;Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt}
What kind of races are there?;First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt}
What are “racing teams”?;Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt}
Quit.;As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt}
Return.${prompt};Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt}
Why not!?;Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt}
Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.${prompt};Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt}
We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A “win-win situation,” as we like to call it in the business.${prompt};In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt}
However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...${prompt};Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt}
The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.${prompt};Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt}
And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.${prompt};Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt}
Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!${prompt};Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt}
First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.${prompt};There are two main types of races.${prompt}
Next, you must bring me either ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.${prompt};The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}
As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.${prompt};Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.${prompt};You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.${prompt};However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.${prompt};The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt}
In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.${prompt};You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)${prompt}
Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.${prompt};The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt};Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt};Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt};In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
There are two main types of races.${prompt};You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt};Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt};Ah, it says here that you are a member of the ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.${prompt}
You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt};Have you come today to change your affiliation?${prompt}
However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt};Remember, you will not be able to use any chocobucks earned in ${choice: 0}[San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] here, and you will also lose any Solo Victory Points that you may have. Are you sure you want to go through with this?${prompt}
The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.${prompt};Join this team?
You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance.

After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).${prompt};Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt}
This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.${prompt};To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt}
We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.${prompt};Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt}
What would you like to ask?;For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt}
${selection-lines};And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt}
What is chocobetting?;Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt}
How do I bet?;The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt}
What are odds?;To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt}
When do I bet?;For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt}
How do I collect winnings?;We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt}
Nothing.${prompt};Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.${prompt}
Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.${prompt};Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.${prompt}
To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.${prompt};It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.${prompt}
Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.${prompt};What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.${prompt}
For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.${prompt};Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.${prompt}
And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.${prompt};The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.${prompt}
Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.${prompt};Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.${prompt}
The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!${prompt};Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.${prompt}
To place a chocobet, you must obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} from the chocobet center. ${prompt};Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.${prompt}
For any single ${item-singular: 0[2]}, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.${prompt};Once the race is finished, you can exchange your ${item-singular: 0[2]} at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.${prompt}
We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.${prompt};Without ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.${prompt}

Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!${prompt};The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt}
The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal.;Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt}
It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.${prompt};You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt}
Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern.;However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt}
If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.${prompt};The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance.${prompt}
Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area.;You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers.
Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.${prompt};Thank you for your understanding.${prompt}
Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint ${color: 5}chocobucks${color: 1}.${prompt};The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt}
Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.${prompt};Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt}
Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.${prompt};Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt}
There are two main types of races.${prompt};In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt}
The first type is called an ${color: 5}official race${color: 1}. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.${prompt};You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt}
Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.${prompt};Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt}
You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.${prompt};Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt}
However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.${prompt};We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.
The second type of race is called a ${color: 5}free run${color: 1}. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance.${prompt};The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.${prompt}
You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers.;Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits.
Thank you for your understanding.${prompt};And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.${prompt}
The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.${prompt};As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind.
Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.${prompt};It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack.
Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.${prompt};Consider yourself warned.${prompt}
In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.${prompt};In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well.
You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.${prompt};Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part.
Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).${prompt};It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!${prompt}
Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.${prompt};Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed.
We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence.;These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.${prompt}

data1：${number: 1};Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own “baby” will be taking the field!${prompt}
tac：${number: 2};Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!${prompt}
item:${number: 3};But of course! I had forgotten all about it!
With me today is a man who needs absolutely no introduction, Markovich, and our favorite...${prompt};Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!
Oh...?;Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt}
Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?${prompt};But that's not where it ends!
I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.${prompt};There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt}
Is that so...?;A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.
Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...${prompt};Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt}
Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone.;It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt}
You of all people should know that the show must go on!${prompt};Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!
Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own “baby” will be taking the field!${prompt};But...${prompt}
Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!${prompt};But...?${prompt}
But of course! I had forgotten all about it!;I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt}
Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you!;I see...
Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!${prompt};Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt}
But that's not where it ends!;You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.
There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?${prompt};Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt}
A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself.;But enough talking, I say.
Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?${prompt};It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt}
It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.${prompt};Oh, yes, right...
Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state!;Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!
But...${prompt};It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt}
But...?${prompt};In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt}
I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.${prompt};Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?
I see...;I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt}
Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?${prompt};${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don't let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep's clothing”!${prompt}
You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo.;I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt}
Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?${prompt};I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt}
But enough talking, I say.;Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt}
It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!${prompt};Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt}
Oh, yes, right...;With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt}
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay!;Whoopee!
It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!${prompt};Bring them on, I say!${prompt}
In the chocobo corner, we have ${chocobo-name: 0[2]}, undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.${prompt};Erm...yes...
Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo?;Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt}
I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.${prompt};Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt}
${chocobo-name: 0[2]}'s formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don't let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, “a wolf in sheep's clothing”!${prompt};Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!
I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!${prompt};Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt}
I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?${prompt};Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.
Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that “monsters” like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.${prompt};I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt}
Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!${prompt};And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt}
With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!${prompt};My, oh my...!
Whoopee!;I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt}
Bring them on, I say!${prompt};A-ahem!
Erm...yes...;I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt}
Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.${prompt};All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!
Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.${prompt};Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt}
Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki!;It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...
Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.${prompt};<Sniffle>${prompt}
Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo.;Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.${prompt};...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt}
And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!${prompt};Hrmmm...
My, oh my...!;Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt}
I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--${prompt};Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt}
A-ahem!;What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!
I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.${prompt};There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt}
All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies!;Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt}
Well done, my pretty! Well done!${prompt};And won't you look at the lineup!
It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders...;This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?
<Sniffle>${prompt};I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt}
Next in the lineup is Sakura.${wait-36: 2};And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt}
...!? What on Vana'diel!?${prompt};Huh?
Hrmmm...;Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt}
Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.${prompt};Ohohohohohoho!
Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...${prompt};You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt}
What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man!;<Gulp>
There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!${prompt};You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt}
Um, yes... Please forgive me...${prompt};...Professor Shantotto!${prompt}
And won't you look at the lineup!;If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,
This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks?;as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt}
I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?${prompt};Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,
And with me today is our regular guest commentator...${prompt};four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt}
Huh?;So if you care to hear out my little proposal,
Why isn't Markovich here?${prompt};these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt}
Ohohohohohoho!;With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...
You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.${prompt};Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt}
<Gulp>;With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?
You...you're that mage from Windurst...${prompt};Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt}
...Professor Shantotto!${prompt};First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt}
If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich,;Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.
as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.${prompt};I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt}
Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence,;Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt}
four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.${prompt};Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”
So if you care to hear out my little proposal,;Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt}
these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.${prompt};Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt}
With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice...;Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.
Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?${prompt};If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt}
With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused?;Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt}
Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.${prompt};For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.
First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.${prompt};Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt}
Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold.;Um...Professor Shantotto...
I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.${prompt};Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt}
Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.${prompt};Ohohohohoho!
Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word “failure.”;Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.
Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.${prompt};But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt}
Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.${prompt};Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.
Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable.;Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt}
If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.${prompt};Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.
Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!${prompt};So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt}
For Ace of Trophies, “championship contender” is an unfitting description.;Ohohohohohoho!
Even “consecutive champion” would not be too high an expectation.${prompt};Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--
Um...Professor Shantotto...;that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt}
Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?${prompt};The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.
Ohohohohoho!;But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt}
Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so.;H-hey!
But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!${prompt};What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt}
Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage.;My, my, what a pleasant surprise!
Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.${prompt};I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt}
Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview.;How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!
So let the race begin, without further ado!${prompt};This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt}
Ohohohohohoho!;Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.
Of this inevitable result, I was always assured--;I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt}
that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!${prompt};And you, Goccilo!
The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor.;What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt}
But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.${prompt};Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!
H-hey!;Until next time...!${prompt}
What do you think you're trying to pull here!?${prompt};${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt}
My, my, what a pleasant surprise!;What's with the baffled expression?
I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.${prompt};It's me, Sakura.${prompt}
How dare you “ohoho” your way into my hard-earned commentary seat!;You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.
This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!${prompt};I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt}
Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification.;I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt}
I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.${prompt};I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt}
And you, Goccilo!;And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt}
What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!${prompt};I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt}
Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing!;Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt}
Until next time...!${prompt};I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt}
${name-player}, I knew you'd make it all the way here.${prompt};I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt}
What's with the baffled expression?;And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2}
It's me, Sakura.${prompt};But something seems to be different...
You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird.;Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt}
I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.${prompt};She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt}
I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.${prompt};The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt}
I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...${prompt};I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!
And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.${prompt};A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt}
I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.${prompt};And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt}
Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.${prompt};It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt}
I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.${prompt};And that completes the lineup, folks.
I hope that'll be your chocobo, ${name-player}!${prompt};With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt}
And next, we have Sakura.${wait-36: 2};You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
But something seems to be different...;Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.${prompt};I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt}
She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!${prompt};I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt}
The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.${prompt};I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt}
I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround!;But no more...
A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.${prompt};If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt}
And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.${prompt};This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt}
It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.${prompt};I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt}
And that completes the lineup, folks.;Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt}
With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!${prompt};Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt}
You find ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt}
Welcome to the Dream Race, ${name-player}.${prompt};Next, we have Sakura...${prompt}
I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.${prompt};Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?
I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.${prompt};This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt}
I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.${prompt};Well I'll be...
But no more...;In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt}
If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.${prompt};...${prompt}
This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.${prompt};Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.
I won't hold back in today's race, ${name-player}.${prompt};For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt}
Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.${prompt};${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt}
Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.${prompt};Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!
I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?${prompt};Congratulations!${prompt}
Next, we have Sakura...${prompt};Great race, ${name-player}.
Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?;It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt}
This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!${prompt};But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..
Well I'll be...;With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt}
In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!${prompt};Princess...
...${prompt};Princess Sakura!${prompt}
Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks.;Princess...?
For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?${prompt};What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt}
${name-player}, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded ${keyitem-article: 0[2]}, ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}, and the exalted title of “Chocochampion”!${prompt};Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.
Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far!;I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt}
Congratulations!${prompt};Searching for...me?${prompt}
Great race, ${name-player}.;Yes, Your Highness.
It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.${prompt};You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt}
But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come..;Are you serious!?
With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...${prompt};Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt}
Princess...;That is correct.
Princess Sakura!${prompt};Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt}
Princess...?;D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt}
What are you talking about? Who are you?${prompt};...!
Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion.;I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt}
I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.${prompt};Wh...what happened?${prompt}
Searching for...me?${prompt};You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.
Yes, Your Highness.;You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt}
You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.${prompt};She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt}
Are you serious!?;Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.
Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?${prompt};But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt}
That is correct.;My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt}
Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.${prompt};So that's what happened...${prompt}
D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?${prompt};Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt}
...!;...${prompt}
I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...${prompt};I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt}
Wh...what happened?${prompt};Your Highness!
You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world.;But...why!?${prompt}
You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...${prompt};Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt}
She...she gave up her life to save me?${prompt};What's more...${prompt}
Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again.;I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt}
But, I never once gave up hope...${prompt};I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt}
My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.${prompt};What...?${prompt}
So that's what happened...${prompt};The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt}
Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos! ${prompt};And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?
...${prompt};I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?${prompt}
I'm sorry, but I can't go.${prompt};I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!${prompt}
Your Highness!;Heehee!
But...why!?${prompt};Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!${prompt}
Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like ${name-player}'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.${prompt};${name-player}, I'm looking forward to our rematch!
What's more...${prompt};Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?${prompt}
I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...${prompt};You're still here, eh, ${name-player}?${prompt}
I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.${prompt};Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?${prompt}
What...?${prompt};What?
The only place I belong is here, beside you.${prompt};How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?${prompt}
And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer?;Hohoho...

As a show of appreciation, I'll teleport you to one of the other nations!;So, are you interested in some entry-level duties to put you well on your way to greatness?
Tell me where you'd like to go, kupo.${prompt};Not to worry, I've got just the thing for you!${prompt}
Greetings and well met! Guardian of the Kingdom, Alaune, at your most humble service.${prompt};Go talk to the guard Aravoge just over yonder and have him cast “Signet” on you. Then come back and see me.${prompt}
Greetings and well met! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service.${prompt};Go talk to the guard Rabid Wolf over yonder and have him cast “Signet” on you. Then come back and see me.${prompt}
Greetings and well met! Protector of the Federation, Selele, at your most humble service.${prompt};Go talk to the guard Harara over yonder and have her cast “Signet” on you. Then come back and see me.${prompt}
My station is to help along those new to the life of an adventurer in Vana'diel.;Well, it looks like you were able to get your Signet. Easy enough, yes?${prompt}
I specialize in the types of fundamental knowledge necessary for success in such endeavors, as well as related methods of pedagogy.;As long as Signet is in effect, there is always a possibility that you will obtain crystals from any enemies that you defeat.
With my aid, you can rest assured that your first steps down the adventurer's path will not go astray.${prompt};There are also other more concrete benefits, such as increased defense and evasion.${prompt}
Should you still consider yourself a newcomer, I would highly recommend that you make full use of my services.${prompt};Signet even helps you when not engaged in combat with an enemy. For example, it boosts the rate at which healing occurs while at rest.
This is my permanent post, and I never leave it. Remember it well.;For all of these reasons and more, you should consider it essential to have Signet cast on you at all times.${prompt}
Whenever you need a hand with anything, anything at all, don't hesitate to come calling.${prompt};Very well, then! As a reward for successful completion of your first assignment I would like to present you with these ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt}
So, are you interested in some entry-level duties to put you well on your way to greatness?;There is more here than “meats” the eye! That was a joke...
Not to worry, I've got just the thing for you!${prompt};Anyway, this is a type of item known amongst adventurers as a “meal.”
Go talk to the guard Aravoge just over yonder and have him cast “Signet” on you. Then come back and see me.${prompt};This meal in particular will temporarily enhance your attack power when eaten.${prompt}
Go talk to the guard Rabid Wolf over yonder and have him cast “Signet” on you. Then come back and see me.${prompt};Whenever any type of meal is consumed, you will receive some such temporary status bonus.
Go talk to the guard Harara over yonder and have her cast “Signet” on you. Then come back and see me.${prompt};Naturally, different meals grant different types of bonuses.${prompt}
Well, it looks like you were able to get your Signet. Easy enough, yes?${prompt};For the most part, meat dishes will affect attack power.
As long as Signet is in effect, there is always a possibility that you will obtain crystals from any enemies that you defeat.;Conversely, seafood dishes generally enhance defense, and so on and so forth.
There are also other more concrete benefits, such as increased defense and evasion.${prompt};Take care to select dishes best suited to your purpose.${prompt}
Signet even helps you when not engaged in combat with an enemy. For example, it boosts the rate at which healing occurs while at rest.;One thing you should make note of, however, is that you cannot eat a meal while another meal's status bonus is still in effect.
For all of these reasons and more, you should consider it essential to have Signet cast on you at all times.${prompt};Your stomach would simply burst!${prompt}
Very well, then! As a reward for successful completion of your first assignment I would like to present you with these ${item-plural: 0[2]}.${prompt};Hmmm, that's quite a lot to cover...
There is more here than “meats” the eye! That was a joke...;Are you with me so far?${prompt}

Whenever any type of meal is consumed, you will receive some such temporary status bonus.;Explain Signet again.

Conversely, seafood dishes generally enhance defense, and so on and so forth.;Great! Well, talking can only prepare you so much. Let's get right down to it.

One thing you should make note of, however, is that you cannot eat a meal while another meal's status bonus is still in effect.;After eating a meal, a status icon designated as “Food” will appear in the upper-left portion of your screen.
Your stomach would simply burst!${prompt};Come back and talk to me again once you've confirmed that it's there.${prompt}
Hmmm, that's quite a lot to cover...;Check out the full belly on you! Well done!
Are you with me so far?${prompt};Signet and meals can both play crucial roles whenever you take on any type of enemy.
So far so good?;This is a key lesson that you would do well not to forget!${prompt}
${selection-lines};Next, let's get those pristine hands of yours nice and dirty!
Explain Signet again.;No sense in letting that food go to waste now, is there? Let's send you out to fight a monster on a full stomach!${prompt}
Explain meals again.;Exiting through that gate over there will lead you into an area with hostile enemies.${prompt}
This is a breeze.${prompt};Try to target one of the monsters and then select the “Check” option from your menu.
Great! Well, talking can only prepare you so much. Let's get right down to it.;This will help you ascertain an enemy's level of difficulty and make sure they are not too strong. A smart adventurer picks ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] fights.${prompt}
Go ahead and pop one of those ${item-plural: 0[2]}!${prompt};Be warned. Engaging any enemy that checks as “very tough” or above will result in your Signet not granting you the defense and evasion bonuses you would otherwise receive.${prompt}
After eating a meal, a status icon designated as “Food” will appear in the upper-left portion of your screen.;And that brings us to your next assignment!${prompt}
Come back and talk to me again once you've confirmed that it's there.${prompt};It's high time you learned how to use a “weapon skill”!${prompt}
Check out the full belly on you! Well done!;Perhaps you've already noticed, but sometimes while fighting an enemy, your “skills” will rise little by little.${prompt}
Signet and meals can both play crucial roles whenever you take on any type of enemy.;When your skill with the weapon you are wielding reaches a predetermined value, weapon skills will become available for use.${prompt}
This is a key lesson that you would do well not to forget!${prompt};“Combo” for those adept with hand-to-hand weapons. “Wasp Sting” for those who fight with daggers.
Next, let's get those pristine hands of yours nice and dirty!;“Fast Blade” for those who prefer the sword.${prompt}
No sense in letting that food go to waste now, is there? Let's send you out to fight a monster on a full stomach!${prompt};“Shining Strike” for wielders of the club. “Heavy Swing” for those who take up the staff.
Exiting through that gate over there will lead you into an area with hostile enemies.${prompt};And on, and on, and on...${prompt}
Try to target one of the monsters and then select the “Check” option from your menu.;Selecting “Status” from the main menu will bring up the “Combat Skl.” option.
This will help you ascertain an enemy's level of difficulty and make sure they are not too strong. A smart adventurer picks ${choice-player-gender}[his/her] fights.${prompt};This will display all of the current skill values in all weapon categories.${prompt}
Be warned. Engaging any enemy that checks as “very tough” or above will result in your Signet not granting you the defense and evasion bonuses you would otherwise receive.${prompt};The first weapon skill for each weapon type can be learned at a skill value of 5.
And that brings us to your next assignment!${prompt};So make that your first goal, and we'll take it from there!${prompt}
It's high time you learned how to use a “weapon skill”!${prompt};Ohhh! Somebody went and learned a new weapon skill, didn't ${choice-player-gender}[he/she]?
Perhaps you've already noticed, but sometimes while fighting an enemy, your “skills” will rise little by little.${prompt};Very good!${prompt}
When your skill with the weapon you are wielding reaches a predetermined value, weapon skills will become available for use.${prompt};I can see by that twinkle in your eyes that you've already used it on some poor, unfortunate creature, but I'll explain just a bit more.
“Combo” for those adept with hand-to-hand weapons. “Wasp Sting” for those who fight with daggers.;Whenever your “Tactical Points” (TP) reach 1000 or more, selecting “Abilities” and then “Weapon Skl.” from the menu will display a list of usable weapon skills.${prompt}
“Fast Blade” for those who prefer the sword.${prompt};These are deadly techniques capable of rendering massive damage on enemies.
“Shining Strike” for wielders of the club. “Heavy Swing” for those who take up the staff.;It is well worth an adventurer's time to learn and master them.${prompt}
And on, and on, and on...${prompt};Ah, by the way, were you fortunate enough to receive some items from the monsters you fought?${prompt}
Selecting “Status” from the main menu will bring up the “Combat Skl.” option.;If you were lucky enough to come across any ${item-plural: 0[2]}, make sure you hang onto them.
This will display all of the current skill values in all weapon categories.${prompt};They may pay dividends later on...${prompt}
The first weapon skill for each weapon type can be learned at a skill value of 5;Also, that reminds me. There is another lesson better learned sooner than later.
So make that your first goal, and we'll take it from there!${prompt};They are truly versatile items that can be used for a number of purposes.
Ohhh! Somebody went and learned a new weapon skill, didn't ${choice-player-gender}[he/she]?;These include trading them to guards for certain rewards, and selling them to earn money, just to name a few.${prompt}
Very good!${prompt};For now, I'd like to explain more about another of their uses. Namely, the role they play in “synthesis.”${prompt}
I can see by that twinkle in your eyes that you've already used it on some poor, unfortunate creature, but I'll explain just a bit more.;But first things first. Your reward for completing your last assignment! Here you are, then.
Whenever your “Tactical Points” (TP) reach 1000 or more, selecting “Abilities” and then “Weapon Skl.” from the menu will display a list of usable weapon skills.${prompt};Now, using ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} will bring up the synthesis interface.
These are deadly techniques capable of rendering massive damage on enemies.;All that remains is to select the “OK” option, and the synthesis will commence!${prompt}
It is well worth an adventurer's time to learn and master them.${prompt};You'll find that the crafting process will never begin, should the ingredients you've selected not form a viable synthesis recipe.
Ah, by the way, were you fortunate enough to receive some items from the monsters you fought?${prompt};Also, even when your materials are correct, there is always a chance that your synthesis will fail, so please be wary.${prompt}
If you were lucky enough to come across any ${item-plural: 0[2]}, make sure you hang onto them.;The majority of items which you create via synthesis, as well as most of those dropped by enemies you defeat, can be placed on the “Auction House” for sale.${prompt}
They may pay dividends later on...${prompt};The auction house is an ultra-consumer venue where you can attempt to purchase the wares of other players by placing bids, as well as have other players bid on items you have put up for sale.${prompt}
Also, that reminds me. There is another lesson better learned sooner than later.;My words alone can do no justice to the vast cornucopia of goods that is the auction house.
They are truly versatile items that can be used for a number of purposes.;One simply must see it with one's own eyes.${prompt}
These include trading them to guards for certain rewards, and selling them to earn money, just to name a few.${prompt};Are you still with me?
For now, I'd like to explain more about another of their uses. Namely, the role they play in “synthesis.”${prompt};${selection-lines}
But first things first. Your reward for completing your last assignment! Here you are, then.;Explain synthesis again.
Now, using ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} will bring up the synthesis interface.;Explain the auction house again.
All that remains is to select the “OK” option, and the synthesis will commence!${prompt};Sure am.${prompt}
You'll find that the crafting process will never begin, should the ingredients you've selected not form a viable synthesis recipe.;Somewhere in this great city lies our nation's auction house. Seek it out, and report back to me when you have found it.${prompt}
Also, even when your materials are correct, there is always a chance that your synthesis will fail, so please be wary.${prompt};You needn't worry about going through with an actual purchase.
The majority of items which you create via synthesis, as well as most of those dropped by enemies you defeat, can be placed on the “Auction House” for sale.${prompt};Simply examining any of the “Auction Counters” will more than suffice.${prompt}
The auction house is an ultra-consumer venue where you can attempt to purchase the wares of other players by placing bids, as well as have other players bid on items you have put up for sale.${prompt};So, you were able to locate the auction house!
My words alone can do no justice to the vast cornucopia of goods that is the auction house.;Pretty hard to miss, isn't it?${prompt}
One simply must see it with one's own eyes.${prompt};What do you think? It is as I said, yes? Few organizations in this world exceed the auction house in scale.
Are you still with me?;It will never cease to be of use to you throughout your adventures. It would be wise to become adept at using it.${prompt}
${selection-lines};And now down to brass tacks!
Explain synthesis again.;Let's see if we can't get you to up some levels!${prompt}
Explain the auction house again.;There are several items in existence which serve to enhance the number of experience points you receive for defeating enemies.${prompt}
Sure am.${prompt};For example, there are ${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 1[2]}, and ${item-plural: 2[2]}, just to name a few.${prompt}
Somewhere in this great city lies our nation's auction house. Seek it out, and report back to me when you have found it.${prompt};These are a bit unique in that you must wait a certain amount of time after equipping them before you may use them.${prompt}
You needn't worry about going through with an actual purchase.;There is also a predetermined amount of time, usually quite long, that must pass before these items can be used again.
Simply examining any of the “Auction Counters” will more than suffice.${prompt};The total number of times you may use any single item is also limited, so be mindful of that as well.${prompt}
So, you were able to locate the auction house!;Many of these items may be obtained from the same guards that provide you with Signet.
Pretty hard to miss, isn't it?${prompt};You need only exchange “Conquest Points” in order to acquire them.${prompt}
What do you think? It is as I said, yes? Few organizations in this world exceed the auction house in scale.;As a matter of fact, for finishing that last assignment, I'm going to give you this ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.
It will never cease to be of use to you throughout your adventures. It would be wise to become adept at using it.${prompt};With this, you'll be able to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} without having to use any of your Conquest Points.${prompt}
And now down to brass tacks!;Head over to any guard and have a go at exchanging them for something.
Let's see if we can't get you to up some levels!${prompt};And after that, see if you can't make it all the way up to level four.
There are several items in existence which serve to enhance the number of experience points you receive for defeating enemies.${prompt};I'll be right here waiting for you when you get back.${prompt}
For example, there are ${item-plural: 0[2]}, ${item-plural: 1[2]}, and ${item-plural: 2[2]}, just to name a few.${prompt};With an experience bonus in place, it should take you practically no time at all.
These are a bit unique in that you must wait a certain amount of time after equipping them before you may use them.${prompt};Good luck, and be careful! It can get quite hairy out there!${prompt}
There is also a predetermined amount of time, usually quite long, that must pass before these items can be used again.;Well, well, well! We might make an adventurer out of you just yet!
The total number of times you may use any single item is also limited, so be mindful of that as well.${prompt};Looks like we've almost washed all that green off of you.${prompt}
Many of these items may be obtained from the same guards that provide you with Signet.;A bit of bad news now, though.
You need only exchange “Conquest Points” in order to acquire them.${prompt};Starting from level 31, anytime you are knocked unconscious your experience points will suffer a deduction.${prompt}
As a matter of fact, for finishing that last assignment, I'm going to give you this ${keyitem-singular: 3[2]}.;As a general rule, the amount penalized will be about 10% of the total amount required to reach the next level.
With this, you'll be able to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} without having to use any of your Conquest Points.${prompt};You have to be more careful than ever from here on out!${prompt}
Head over to any guard and have a go at exchanging them for something.;However, there are ways to minimize this loss of experience points.${prompt}
And after that, see if you can't make it all the way up to level four.;Like this, for example. Go on, take it. Your reward for reaching level four.
I'll be right here waiting for you when you get back.${prompt};It's called ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt}
With an experience bonus in place, it should take you practically no time at all.;Using this will grant you a status known as “Reraise.”
Good luck, and be careful! It can get quite hairy out there!${prompt};Whenever you are rendered unconscious while this effect is in place, you will have the option to revive yourself.${prompt}
Well, well, well! We might make an adventurer out of you just yet!;Choosing to do so will cause you to be resuscitated in the very spot where you have fallen.
Looks like we've almost washed all that green off of you.${prompt};In addition, as I stated previously, the amount of experience points you lose will be somewhat lessened.${prompt}
A bit of bad news now, though.;That is, once equipped, you must wait a certain period of time before they can be used, and there are both cooldown timers and limited charges as well.${prompt}
Starting from level 31, anytime you are knocked unconscious your experience points will suffer a deduction.${prompt};All of these items as a whole are collectively referred to as “enchanted items.”
As a general rule, the amount penalized will be about 10% of the total amount required to reach the next level.;There is a vast array of other enchanted items with myriad other effects that will prove useful on your adventures.
You have to be more careful than ever from here on out!${prompt};It may be worth the time and effort to better acquaint yourself with them at some point.${prompt}
However, there are ways to minimize this loss of experience points.${prompt};It seems you're starting to get the hang of things.
Like this, for example. Go on, take it. Your reward for reaching level four.;Next, I'd like for you to go and fight some enemies in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon].${prompt}
It's called ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]}.${prompt};${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/The Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] is located beyond the ${choice: 2}[southern/northern/northern] reaches of ${choice: 2}[West Ronfaure/North Gustaberg/East Sarutabaruta].${prompt}
Using this will grant you a status known as “Reraise.”;You're sure to encounter some new monsters there that you won't find prowling around the outskirts of the city.
Whenever you are rendered unconscious while this effect is in place, you will have the option to revive yourself.${prompt};It may be a bit daunting, so I'll only require that you slay one such beast, and then head on back.${prompt}
Choosing to do so will cause you to be resuscitated in the very spot where you have fallen.;Just keep in mind, the farther you stray from the city, the more ferocious monsters tend to be.
In addition, as I stated previously, the amount of experience points you lose will be somewhat lessened.${prompt};Don't say I didn't warn you.${prompt}
That is, once equipped, you must wait a certain period of time before they can be used, and there are both cooldown timers and limited charges as well.${prompt};Make sure to use the “Check” command to determine the strength of your enemy.
All of these items as a whole are collectively referred to as “enchanted items.”;If you find that you are surrounded by enemies too difficult for you, try heading back to a previous area closer to the city and leveling up a bit more first.${prompt}
There is a vast array of other enchanted items with myriad other effects that will prove useful on your adventures.;I know those smells...
It may be worth the time and effort to better acquaint yourself with them at some point.${prompt};You smell of victory! And of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon]! Good on you, ${name-player}.${prompt}
It seems you're starting to get the hang of things.;But by now you must be getting sick and tired of fighting the same old monsters so close to the city walls, aren't you?${prompt}
Next, I'd like for you to go and fight some enemies in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon].${prompt};If you are several levels beyond a monster and totally outclass them in every respect, checking them will yield a “too weak to be worthwhile” result.${prompt}
${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/The Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] is located beyond the ${choice: 2}[southern/northern/northern] reaches of ${choice: 2}[West Ronfaure/North Gustaberg/East Sarutabaruta].${prompt};Killing monsters so far beneath you is borderline cowardice, and will net you no experience points.${prompt}
You're sure to encounter some new monsters there that you won't find prowling around the outskirts of the city.;If you start to notice more and more of these “too weak” monsters around you, consider moving farther from the city to a more difficult area.${prompt}
It may be a bit daunting, so I'll only require that you slay one such beast, and then head on back.${prompt};Congratulations on another milestone! Reward tiiime!
Just keep in mind, the farther you stray from the city, the more ferocious monsters tend to be.;You've just earned yourself ${number: 0} experience points, hotshot.${prompt}
Don't say I didn't warn you.${prompt};Let's dive right into your next assignment while that blood is still pumping!${prompt}
Make sure to use the “Check” command to determine the strength of your enemy.;I'm going to up the stakes here a little bit, ${name-player}. But it's for your own good.
If you find that you are surrounded by enemies too difficult for you, try heading back to a previous area closer to the city and leveling up a bit more first.${prompt};I want you to go out and get all the way to level ten.${prompt}
I know those smells...;Considering your current level and the knowledge you have, you shouldn't confine yourself to the immediate vicinity of the city.
You smell of victory! And of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon]! Good on you, ${name-player}.${prompt};You're more than capable of besting monsters in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] at this point.${prompt}
But by now you must be getting sick and tired of fighting the same old monsters so close to the city walls, aren't you?${prompt};I knew you wouldn't disappoint me. So how's it feel? You're moving on up in the world.
If you are several levels beyond a monster and totally outclass them in every respect, checking them will yield a “too weak to be worthwhile” result.${prompt};Time to put some money in those pockets. A ${number: 1}-gil reward, just for you. Don't spend it all in one place.${prompt}
Killing monsters so far beneath you is borderline cowardice, and will net you no experience points.${prompt};By now you should be relatively familiar with the basics of battle. Am I right or am I right?${prompt}
If you start to notice more and more of these “too weak” monsters around you, consider moving farther from the city to a more difficult area.${prompt};But don't go getting too cocky!
Congratulations on another milestone! Reward tiiime!;This world is chock-full of monsters just waiting for the opportune moment to pounce and knock you out cold!${prompt}
You've just earned yourself ${number: 0} experience points, hotshot.${prompt};Depending on the type of monster, there are several factors that could cause them to attack you without provocation.
Let's dive right into your next assignment while that blood is still pumping!${prompt};I'll enumerate some of the more common types of this blatantly aggressive behavior for you.${prompt}
I'm going to up the stakes here a little bit, ${name-player}. But it's for your own good.;For starters, and most obviously, there are monsters which detect by sight. They will attack you whenever you enter their field of vision. This is the most prevalent type. They simply cannot stand the sight of adventurers.${prompt}
I want you to go out and get all the way to level ten.${prompt};Next, there are those monsters which detect by sound. They can be a bit more dangerous than visually-dependent monsters, in that they will attack the source of any sound within a certain prescribed radius.
Considering your current level and the knowledge you have, you shouldn't confine yourself to the immediate vicinity of the city.;You may not think it, but there are a great many monsters whose aural senses are far more developed than their sense of sight.${prompt}
You're more than capable of besting monsters in ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] at this point.${prompt};There are also monsters which detect their enemies' spellcasting. Much like the sound-detecting types, these monsters will attack the source of any magic casting within a certain radius of their being.
I knew you wouldn't disappoint me. So how's it feel? You're moving on up in the world.;Not surprisingly, many monsters in the arcana family rely heavily on this method of detection, which covers a comparatively larger range than the aforementioned sense of hearing.${prompt}
Time to put some money in those pockets. A ${number: 1}-gil reward, just for you. Don't spend it all in one place.${prompt};And finally, there are opportunistic monsters which prey upon the weak and near-dead, pinpointing their prey by detecting low hit points.
By now you should be relatively familiar with the basics of battle. Am I right or am I right?${prompt};The family of undead creatures abound in monsters of this type. Even more distressing, the fewer the hit points you have, the farther the distance from which you can be detected.${prompt}
But don't go getting too cocky!;Your next assignment will attempt to familiarize you with these detection methods, and train you to become adept at avoiding them.${prompt}
This world is chock-full of monsters just waiting for the opportune moment to pounce and knock you out cold!${prompt};I want you to travel once again to ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], and retrieve an item known as a “Gate Crystal.”${prompt}
Depending on the type of monster, there are several factors that could cause them to attack you without provocation.;Near the center of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], you will find a large, white, almost otherworldly structure. On the area map, it is labeled as the ${choice: 2}[Crag of Holla/Crag of Dem/Crag of Mea].${prompt}
I'll enumerate some of the more common types of this blatantly aggressive behavior for you.${prompt};There you will find one of an enormous series of crystals known as “Telepoints.”
For starters, and most obviously, there are monsters which detect by sight. They will attack you whenever you enter their field of vision. This is the most prevalent type. They simply cannot stand the sight of adventurers.${prompt};Simply examine the telepoint you find there, and bring back your findings.${prompt}
Next, there are those monsters which detect by sound. They can be a bit more dangerous than visually-dependent monsters, in that they will attack the source of any sound within a certain prescribed radius.;Only when you present your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to me shall your assignment be complete.${prompt}
You may not think it, but there are a great many monsters whose aural senses are far more developed than their sense of sight.${prompt};Exercise the utmost caution. There are many extremely dangerous monsters in the area you will be visiting.
There are also monsters which detect their enemies' spellcasting. Much like the sound-detecting types, these monsters will attack the source of any magic casting within a certain radius of their being.;And take extra care not to draw the attention of any beastmen.${prompt}
Not surprisingly, many monsters in the arcana family rely heavily on this method of detection, which covers a comparatively larger range than the aforementioned sense of hearing.${prompt};This shall be your final assignment.
And finally, there are opportunistic monsters which prey upon the weak and near-dead, pinpointing their prey by detecting low hit points.;Go now, and may the Goddess watch over you.${prompt}
The family of undead creatures abound in monsters of this type. Even more distressing, the fewer the hit points you have, the farther the distance from which you can be detected.${prompt};Ahhh, the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, just as I requested.
Your next assignment will attempt to familiarize you with these detection methods, and train you to become adept at avoiding them.${prompt};Excellent work, ${name-player}.${prompt}
I want you to travel once again to ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], and retrieve an item known as a “Gate Crystal.”${prompt};And now for some information regarding this little beauty.
Near the center of ${choice: 2}[La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], you will find a large, white, almost otherworldly structure. On the area map, it is labeled as the ${choice: 2}[Crag of Holla/Crag of Dem/Crag of Mea].${prompt};As long as you have this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, you will be able to be transported by the appropriate spell of teleportation directly to the telepoint from which you retrieved it.${prompt}
There you will find one of an enormous series of crystals known as “Telepoints.”;I doubt that you will have many opportunities to use it for the time being, but you would do well to remember what I have said.${prompt}
Simply examine the telepoint you find there, and bring back your findings.${prompt};Several such telepoints exist, scattered throughout Vana'diel.
Only when you present your ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]} to me shall your assignment be complete.${prompt};Each has its own specific gate crystal, which you will receive the first time that you examine any of them.${prompt}
Exercise the utmost caution. There are many extremely dangerous monsters in the area you will be visiting.;Let me take this time to offer you a most heartfelt congratulations, ${name-player}!
And take extra care not to draw the attention of any beastmen.${prompt};You have successfully completed all of the assignments I have laid before you.${prompt}
This shall be your final assignment.;And here I have a most fitting reward for you. A gift of ${number: 1} experience points, and ${number: 3} ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt}
Go now, and may the Goddess watch over you.${prompt};I fear that I have nothing more to teach you.
Ahhh, the ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, just as I requested.;From now on, your lessons will best be learned by giving a mindful ear to others and being ever observant on your travels.${prompt}
Excellent work, ${name-player}.${prompt};Do remember, though, that the paths open before you will multiply greatly should you cooperate with other adventurers.${prompt}
And now for some information regarding this little beauty.;Leveling, for example, is an endeavor made immeasurably more efficient and enjoyable in the company of others.
As long as you have this ${keyitem-singular: 0[2]}, you will be able to be transported by the appropriate spell of teleportation directly to the telepoint from which you retrieved it.${prompt};It helps to not only guarantee you some modicum of safety in numbers, but also rewards you with considerably more experience points than adventuring alone.${prompt}
I doubt that you will have many opportunities to use it for the time being, but you would do well to remember what I have said.${prompt};I suppose it does require a good deal of courage to approach an adventurer you do not know, but I strongly encourage you to do so.
Several such telepoints exist, scattered throughout Vana'diel.;It may prove to be the beginning of an extremely rewarding and long-lasting friendship.${prompt}
Each has its own specific gate crystal, which you will receive the first time that you examine any of them.${prompt};There may still be some small facets of adventuring that I can continue to offer you advice on.
Let me take this time to offer you a most heartfelt congratulations, ${name-player}!;Should you ever have any questions or anxieties, please do not hesitate to come and see me again.
You have successfully completed all of the assignments I have laid before you.${prompt};I will do my best to be of service and set your heart at ease.${prompt}
And here I have a most fitting reward for you. A gift of ${number: 1} experience points, and ${number: 3} ${item-plural: 2[2]}.${prompt};Go now, and go well. The world awaits its next great adventurer, ${name-player}.${prompt}
I fear that I have nothing more to teach you.;Good day to you! Guardian of the Kingdom, Alaune, at your most humble service.
From now on, your lessons will best be learned by giving a mindful ear to others and being ever observant on your travels.${prompt};Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
Do remember, though, that the paths open before you will multiply greatly should you cooperate with other adventurers.${prompt};Good day to you! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service.
Leveling, for example, is an endeavor made immeasurably more efficient and enjoyable in the company of others.;Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
It helps to not only guarantee you some modicum of safety in numbers, but also rewards you with considerably more experience points than adventuring alone.${prompt};Good day to you! Protector of the Federation, Selele, at your most humble service..
I suppose it does require a good deal of courage to approach an adventurer you do not know, but I strongly encourage you to do so.;Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt}
It may prove to be the beginning of an extremely rewarding and long-lasting friendship.${prompt};What will you ask about?
There may still be some small facets of adventuring that I can continue to offer you advice on.;${selection-lines}
Should you ever have any questions or anxieties, please do not hesitate to come and see me again.;Nothing just now.
I will do my best to be of service and set your heart at ease.${prompt};Search comments.
Go now, and go well. The world awaits its next great adventurer, ${name-player}.${prompt};Skillchains.
Good day to you! Guardian of the Kingdom, Alaune, at your most humble service.;Magic bursts.
Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt};Skillchains and elements.${prompt}
Good day to you! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service.;Just as their name implies, search comments are original messages composed by adventurers which are readily visible to others when using the search function.${prompt}
Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt};There are several different categories of search comments.
Good day to you! Protector of the Federation, Selele, at your most humble service..;These include, but are not limited to, “EXP Party,” “Items,” and “Missions and Quests.”${prompt}
Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?${prompt};Opening the “Search” function from the Main Menu and then selecting the “Comment” option will allow you to conduct a player search by comment type.${prompt}
What will you ask about?;For example, if you would like to search for other players to form a leveling party, you need only select “EXP Party” from the list displayed.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Conversely, if you would like to advertise yourself as interested in being on the receiving end of an experience party invite, you can choose the “Edit Comment” command from the Search menu.${prompt}
Nothing just now.;Of course, search comment composition differs from person to person.
Search comments.;You might want to conduct a search first to see what type of search comments are considered the norm before writing your own.${prompt}
Skillchains.;Skillchains are devastating elemental phenomena which manifest themselves when weapon skills are carried out in a precise and well-timed order. ${prompt}
Magic bursts.;The very natures of the skillchains themselves differ widely, being dependent upon the weapon skills used and the order of their execution.${prompt}
Skillchains and elements.${prompt};To take a simple and timeless example, using the weapon skill “Red Lotus Blade” immediately after “Fast Blade” will yield a type of skillchain known as “Liquefaction.”${prompt}
Just as their name implies, search comments are original messages composed by adventurers which are readily visible to others when using the search function.${prompt};Furthermore, adding a “Combo” after the liquefaction effect will produce a more advanced “Fusion” skillchain.${prompt}
There are several different categories of search comments.;In the taxonomy of skillchains, each type is related to one or more specific elements.
These include, but are not limited to, “EXP Party,” “Items,” and “Missions and Quests.”${prompt};Liquefaction is bound to the element of fire, for example, and fusion to both fire and light.${prompt}
Opening the “Search” function from the Main Menu and then selecting the “Comment” option will allow you to conduct a player search by comment type.${prompt};Another crucial point, which I simply cannot emphasize enough, is the importance of timing in the execution of skillchains.${prompt}
For example, if you would like to search for other players to form a leveling party, you need only select “EXP Party” from the list displayed.${prompt};One must not be too overzealous, but too much patience can also be damning.
Conversely, if you would like to advertise yourself as interested in being on the receiving end of an experience party invite, you can choose the “Edit Comment” command from the Search menu.${prompt};It is most ideal to time the latter weapon skill to begin just a second or two after the preceding one is complete.${prompt}
Of course, search comment composition differs from person to person.;The possible weapon skill sequences and the different skillchains they yield are highly variegated.
You might want to conduct a search first to see what type of search comments are considered the norm before writing your own.${prompt};It is said of this time-tested battle art that it “takes a moment to learn, and a lifetime to master.”${prompt}
Skillchains are devastating elemental phenomena which manifest themselves when weapon skills are carried out in a precise and well-timed order. ${prompt};Magic bursts are another type of supernatural phenomena which occur after carefully selected and impeccably timed spells are cast following a skillchain. Such spells exceed their typical counterparts in that they are enhanced in both power and accuracy.
The very natures of the skillchains themselves differ widely, being dependent upon the weapon skills used and the order of their execution.${prompt};You will commonly see magic bursts abbreviated as “MB.”${prompt}
To take a simple and timeless example, using the weapon skill “Red Lotus Blade” immediately after “Fast Blade” will yield a type of skillchain known as “Liquefaction.”${prompt};Magic bursts will not take place if the element of the spell being cast does not match the element of the skillchain preceding it.${prompt}
Furthermore, adding a “Combo” after the liquefaction effect will produce a more advanced “Fusion” skillchain.${prompt};To take an example, a detonation skillchain, which has wind as its element, followed by an aero or other like spell, will generate a magic burst.${prompt}
In the taxonomy of skillchains, each type is related to one or more specific elements.;In the same vein, thunder, or any cognate spell, would result in a magic burst should it follow an impaction skillchain, itself deriving power from that very element.${prompt}
Liquefaction is bound to the element of fire, for example, and fusion to both fire and light.${prompt};As I said previously, some skillchains are associated with more than one element. Take fragmentation, for example. It is composed of equal parts wind and thunder. So chasing a fragmentation skillchain with any type of aero or thunder spell would create a magic burst.${prompt}
Another crucial point, which I simply cannot emphasize enough, is the importance of timing in the execution of skillchains.${prompt};The key to mastering magic bursts lies in learning the elemental attributes of both the skillchains you create as well as the magic you wield. The rest is simply a matter of timing.${prompt}
One must not be too overzealous, but too much patience can also be damning.;For your convenience, I will go over the elemental attributes of all skillchain types. Pay close attention.${prompt}
It is most ideal to time the latter weapon skill to begin just a second or two after the preceding one is complete.${prompt};Level 1 Skillchain (Associated element):

${choice: 2}[I see you've already heard-weard, but let me review the details./Let me filly-will you in on the details.]${prompt};Oh deary-wear.

One of my fabulous superiors--not as fabulous-wabulous as me, of course--has directed me to make this magic available to explorers of all shapes and sizes.${prompt};I love your positive energy! This will be absolutaruly delightful!${prompt}
So I'd like to experimentaru on you...${prompt};Windurstians have always been receptive to new ideas and ways of doing things. That's why I'm so excitarued to put my many talents to use here!${prompt}
Err...${prompt};I guess the institute has some of my colleagues posted in San d'Oria and Bastok looking for subjectarus, too, but their small victories will surely pale in comparison to my series of conquestarus!${prompt}
With you! Experimentaru with you!${wait-36: 2};Oh no, I've done it again...${prompt}
Oh dear, that didn't come out right, either. But I know you're just itching to give it a shot, aren't you?${prompt};My charming smile may have lured you in, but the endless possibilities of participating here in Windurst surely have you rivetarued! What do you say?${prompt}

I didn't think it was possible, but I may have screwed that one up.${prompt};Ugh! Who would want to make the trekky-wek all the way to Bastok or San d'Oria when they've got an adorable little figure right in front of them? I think it's in your best interest to reconsider.${prompt}

Well met, I am Dr. Yoran-Oran, former minister-ethy of the Rhinostery in Windurst, and involved in all manner of magical research.${prompt};Could this in fact be the perfect-ethy avenue to promote my glorious research?${prompt}

How are you getting along with your luopan? Have you gotten used to using Colures, yet?

I refuse to yield until humanity's blight is purged from this land.${prompt};Having seen the promised land, it rages and struggles each day to become more than it was meant to be.${prompt}
I now serve to bring darkness unending, an umbral shroud choking the life from Vana'diel.${prompt};And it continues to claw its way forward, even if what it aspires to be does not truly exist.${prompt}
Simply opening the Gate of the Gods would bring the Zilart what they have been denied for over ten thousand years.${prompt};Its insatiable avarice defines it more than even it can possibly realize.${prompt}
The endless nightmare would be endless no longer.${prompt};But I am not a “human” such as you. I will be--I must be--an existence far beyond the most grandiose thought of such petty, grasping beings.${prompt}
Have you ever paused to consider exactly whose nightmare it is?${prompt};For that is what life is. And those who cannot reach that pinnacle are fated to perish.${prompt}
Those who have ceased to be? Those who walk Vana'diel as she stands today?${prompt};Time is a cruel beast whose savageness cannot be sated.${prompt}
Old gods? New?${prompt};Every man, woman, and child feels its claws sinking into their backs, the talons digging ever deeper with each passing day.${prompt}
No. It is a nightmare of the crystals themselves.${prompt};It marches on, unstoppable, immaterial, and unforgiving, and all any of us can do is watch it pass.${prompt}
We were born in Vana'diel and exist only due to her endless bounty.${prompt};I claimed ever greater power in pursuit of my goals until my time, too, ran out.${prompt}
And yet our very presence here is an affront to her. We are the source of her nightmare.${prompt};All I wanted to do was protect my countrymen...my homeland...${prompt}
There is one secret to humanity's success: ambition. Imagining a better future, it strives ever onward in search of it.${prompt};An alternate world, with alternate fates and alternate existences.${prompt}
Having seen the promised land, it rages and struggles each day to become more than it was meant to be.${prompt};I gambled my own life away to protect the world I called home.${prompt}

For that is what life is. And those who cannot reach that pinnacle are fated to perish.${prompt};...did it mean everything was for naught?${prompt}
Time is a cruel beast whose savageness cannot be sated.${prompt};I, and I alone, have seen the true nature of things in this world.${prompt}

Come. Surely your vision cannot be that clouded.${prompt};At best you might buy it a few more phases of the moon.${prompt}

The minds of all who have existed--and all who will exist--are as one.${prompt};So in the end, all my journeys have been utterly without meaning.${prompt}
As, too, are the light and darkness inherent in the mothercrystals.${prompt};One by one, those I have trusted have fallen. None are left to prop me up when I begin to falter.${prompt}
I need not point out that the apparitions appearing before you are those whose schemes you have foiled.${prompt};Hahaha...none know who I rrreally am.${prompt}

And now is the time for me to fill you with that energy. Come.${prompt};Perhaps not even your precious-wecious “hope.”
You don't really expect to save the world, do you?${prompt};Some claim that hope is what keeps humanity sane in these trying times...yet in reality it is a prison that shuts away the real world.${prompt}

Still, I shan't assist you if you don't promise.${prompt};If you can find me here, then you'll surely see me in other locations too, kupo. Moogle magic, you know.${prompt}
Then the deed is done! In exchange, I shall proudly proffer my services in making your crystals ephemeral, too, kupo.${prompt};Of course, I do not actually exist in Vana'diel. Only a part of me projects into your world.${prompt}
Ahhh, mayhap I have moved too quickly. Allow me to apprise you of the particulars--of this “crystal storage,” if you will.${prompt};It's rather similar to summoning magic, kupo.${prompt}

${selection-lines};Oh! I see you must have had a meeting-weeting with her already.${prompt}
Obtain a kit.;Yes, I have heard all aboutaru it. It is a shield that can increase one's crafting abilities. I was quite surprised when I heard the story.${prompt}
Check the scheduled quantity.;If that story is for real-weal, then I definitely would like to see it for myself.${prompt}
Ship the item.;I know all about your talentaru, and if she chose you too, it must mean you have the qualifications necessary to make the shield.${prompt}
Nothing.${prompt};Now, allow me to teach you the recipe-wecipe.${prompt}
Which do you want?;So, with this particular ingredientaru list, you first need to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}
${selection-lines};This item is needed to boostaru the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its full potential.${prompt}
Exit.${prompt};I actually received some notes on the topic-wopic of Craftsmanship. Please bear with me while I go over them.${prompt}
What is the quality? (1-1000);You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} equipped.${prompt}
${lettercase: 1}${item-singular: 0[2]}: ${number: 1}${prompt};Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.${prompt}
Oh, hello-wello. What is that shield you are carrying?${prompt};In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.${prompt}
Oh! I see you must have had a meeting-weeting with her already.${prompt};You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...${prompt}
Yes, I have heard all aboutaru it. It is a shield that can increase one's crafting abilities. I was quite surprised when I heard the story.${prompt};So, did you find that little tidbitaru of information useful?${prompt}
If that story is for real-weal, then I definitely would like to see it for myself.${prompt};Once the Craftsmanship is high enough, come to me and I will make you the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
I know all about your talentaru, and if she chose you too, it must mean you have the qualifications necessary to make the shield.${prompt};After that, you'll need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} nextaru, which you can obtain from Julissois.${prompt}
Now, allow me to teach you the recipe-wecipe.${prompt};I assume you are no stranger-wranger to making deliveries. That is basically how you will get the ingredients you need.${prompt}
So, with this particular ingredientaru list, you first need to obtain ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};You can speak with Julissois for more information.${prompt}
This item is needed to boostaru the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its full potential.${prompt};That covers the ingredient listaru. Please bring the shield by once you have made the upgrade. I'm curious to see it for myself.${prompt}
I actually received some notes on the topic-wopic of Craftsmanship. Please bear with me while I go over them.${prompt};Hm? You say you forgotaru the recipe already? Wait just a moment and I will get you the list again. Professional craftsmen really need to remember these kinds of things.${prompt}
You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} equipped.${prompt};You have worked hard to master your craftaru. I have faith that you can handle this.${prompt}
Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.${prompt};I see... That's the ticketaru. I should be able to use this to make the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.${prompt};This mustaru be the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...${prompt};I am not sure how the whole thing works, but it is amazing to think that I can pour my soul-woul into this shield somehow.${prompt}
So, did you find that little tidbitaru of information useful?${prompt};Oh, it seems that when the ${item-singular: 0[2]} was wroughtaru, it somehow reduced the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Once the Craftsmanship is high enough, come to me and I will make you the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};That is not a problem if you wantaru to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but if you need to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you would need to increase the Craftsmanship again.${prompt}
After that, you'll need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]} nextaru, which you can obtain from Julissois.${prompt};Of course, you're not the type to lose something so valuable-waluable and need to replace it.${prompt}
I assume you are no stranger-wranger to making deliveries. That is basically how you will get the ingredients you need.${prompt};Impossible. You mean to tell me that you actually lostaru the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}
You can speak with Julissois for more information.${prompt};Well, I suppose these things happen-wappen. I'll make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}, so please let me borrow your shield.${prompt}
That covers the ingredient listaru. Please bring the shield by once you have made the upgrade. I'm curious to see it for myself.${prompt};You are a professional craftsman. As such, it should not be so difficultaru to take care of your ingredients.${prompt}
Hm? You say you forgotaru the recipe already? Wait just a moment and I will get you the list again. Professional craftsmen really need to remember these kinds of things.${prompt};It appears you made the upgrade without incidentaru. Do you mind if I take a look?${prompt}
You have worked hard to master your craftaru. I have faith that you can handle this.${prompt};Oh... I can see that it has changed, and it is giving off a faintaru energy. However, you can tell that it is not complete yet.${prompt}
I see... That's the ticketaru. I should be able to use this to make the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};No, you must craft it multiple-wultiple times in order to achieve the level you seek. That is what she told me anyway.${prompt}
This mustaru be the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};That reminds me... She asked for some kind of sign after the shield is complete. Please give me a momentaru.${prompt}
I am not sure how the whole thing works, but it is amazing to think that I can pour my soul-woul into this shield somehow.${prompt};That should do it.${prompt}
Oh, it seems that when the ${item-singular: 0[2]} was wroughtaru, it somehow reduced the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};Now, take this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and everything will be perfectaru.${prompt}
That is not a problem if you wantaru to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but if you need to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}, you would need to increase the Craftsmanship again.${prompt};Oh, justaru one more thing. I often have deliveries for Julissois, and would appreciate it if you could help me train the younger members of the guild.${prompt}
Of course, you're not the type to lose something so valuable-waluable and need to replace it.${prompt};Welcome. Our mutual friend told me you would be paying me a visitaru.${prompt}
Impossible. You mean to tell me that you actually lostaru the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};You're here to upgrade your shield, right? Firstaru, you'll need to learn the recipe.${prompt}
Well, I suppose these things happen-wappen. I'll make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}, so please let me borrow your shield.${prompt};You're awfully quietaru. Did you get that?${prompt}
You are a professional craftsman. As such, it should not be so difficultaru to take care of your ingredients.${prompt};As for the listaru of ingredients, the first thing you'll need is the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
It appears you made the upgrade without incidentaru. Do you mind if I take a look?${prompt};You'll need to equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} while you craftaru until you boost its Craftsmanship to 100%.${prompt}
Oh... I can see that it has changed, and it is giving off a faintaru energy. However, you can tell that it is not complete yet.${prompt};Do you remember equipping the aspis while you were crafting before? This is basically the same conceptaru.${prompt}
No, you must craft it multiple-wultiple times in order to achieve the level you seek. That is what she told me anyway.${prompt};Once it reaches 100%, bring it to me so I can inspectaru it and make the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
That reminds me... She asked for some kind of sign after the shield is complete. Please give me a momentaru.${prompt};Next is the ${item-singular: 2[2]} and the ${item-singular: 3[2]}. You are familiar with the ${item-singular: 3[2]} from before. You can requestaru both of them from Julissois.${prompt}
That should do it.${prompt};The lastaru thing you'll need is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. Together with the A.M.A.N., I've prepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt}
Now, take this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and everything will be perfectaru.${prompt};You can refer to the Records of Eminence menu for additional information. Once you complete all of them, you will receive a perfectaru ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt}
Oh, justaru one more thing. I often have deliveries for Julissois, and would appreciate it if you could help me train the younger members of the guild.${prompt};That concludes my explanation on the ingredients. You are a person of great talentaru. I know you'll do an excellent job.${prompt}
Welcome. Our mutual friend told me you would be paying me a visitaru.${prompt};Oh, it looks like you've given a nice boostaru to the shield's Craftsmanship.${prompt}
You're here to upgrade your shield, right? Firstaru, you'll need to learn the recipe.${prompt};Now, please waitaru while I make the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt}
You're awfully quietaru. Did you get that?${prompt};Okay, here you go.${prompt}
As for the listaru of ingredients, the first thing you'll need is the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};Ahh, it's just as I thoughtaru. Making the ${item-singular: 0[2]} caused the shield's Craftsmanship to decrease.${prompt}
You'll need to equip the ${item-singular: 0[2]} while you craftaru until you boost its Craftsmanship to 100%.${prompt};Therefore, make sure you take good care of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} so you don't have to craftaru it multiple times.${prompt}
Do you remember equipping the aspis while you were crafting before? This is basically the same conceptaru.${prompt};My my! I'm not usually one to make shields, but even I can tell this one is of high quality! You truly are an expertaru craftsman!${prompt}
Once it reaches 100%, bring it to me so I can inspectaru it and make the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};Indeed, I can sense greataru power coming from it compared to the last one you made.${prompt}
Next is the ${item-singular: 2[2]} and the ${item-singular: 3[2]}. You are familiar with the ${item-singular: 3[2]} from before. You can requestaru both of them from Julissois.${prompt};Now, before I forgetaru, allow me to mark the shield so you can take it back to her.${prompt}
The lastaru thing you'll need is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. Together with the A.M.A.N., I've prepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt};There, all finished. Take this shield to Mewk Chorosap and you'll be set.${prompt}
You can refer to the Records of Eminence menu for additional information. Once you complete all of them, you will receive a perfectaru ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt};This kind of thing happens to all of us. You can have another try at the final objective, so make sure you get it rightaru this time.${prompt}
That concludes my explanation on the ingredients. You are a person of great talentaru. I know you'll do an excellent job.${prompt};Well, well, look who's chomping at the bitaru. Let's get down to business, then.${prompt}
Oh, it looks like you've given a nice boostaru to the shield's Craftsmanship.${prompt};Ah, so you know the recipe already? Then I'll share with you something you might not know.${prompt}
Now, please waitaru while I make the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you.${prompt};It's about how to get ${item-plural: 4[2]} and ${item-plural: 5[2]}.${prompt}
Okay, here you go.${prompt};You've got to take orders-worders from the guild and bring them to the person who placed them.${prompt}
Ahh, it's just as I thoughtaru. Making the ${item-singular: 0[2]} caused the shield's Craftsmanship to decrease.${prompt};Not only do they have an eye for quality, but they want to see the artisan at work up close.${prompt}
Therefore, make sure you take good care of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} so you don't have to craftaru it multiple times.${prompt};For the most part, they'll only acceptaru items that you made right at their side.${prompt}
My my! I'm not usually one to make shields, but even I can tell this one is of high quality! You truly are an expertaru craftsman!${prompt};And you will have to procure the materials yourself. I presume this doesn't pose a problem?${prompt}
Indeed, I can sense greataru power coming from it compared to the last one you made.${prompt};The good news is that some products have been made available at other guilds.${prompt}
Now, before I forgetaru, allow me to mark the shield so you can take it back to her.${prompt};Among these, of course, are synthesis kitarus.${prompt}
There, all finished. Take this shield to Mewk Chorosap and you'll be set.${prompt};Of course, it's anyone's guess as to whether or not they'll be in stock.${prompt}
This kind of thing happens to all of us. You can have another try at the final objective, so make sure you get it rightaru this time.${prompt};I'll give you ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]} once you have filled all the orders.${prompt}
Well, well, look who's chomping at the bitaru. Let's get down to business, then.${prompt};Here is the ${choice: 0}[first/second/last] order.${prompt}
Ah, so you know the recipe already? Then I'll share with you something you might not know.${prompt};Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Nouveil in ${unknown: 0x01053782E78180}.${prompt}
It's about how to get ${item-plural: 4[2]} and ${item-plural: 5[2]}.${prompt};Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Yaman-Hachuman in the Orastery in ${unknown: 0x01053782F08180}.${prompt}
You've got to take orders-worders from the guild and bring them to the person who placed them.${prompt};Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Yaman-Hachuman in the Orastery in ${unknown: 0x01053782F08180}.${prompt}
Not only do they have an eye for quality, but they want to see the artisan at work up close.${prompt};Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Nouveil in ${unknown: 0x01053782E78180}.${prompt}
For the most part, they'll only acceptaru items that you made right at their side.${prompt};For those, it doesn't matter whether or not you make it at their side.${prompt}
And you will have to procure the materials yourself. I presume this doesn't pose a problem?${prompt};Report back once you have delivered-wivered the items.${prompt}
The good news is that some products have been made available at other guilds.${prompt};Your current requestaru is...${prompt}
Among these, of course, are synthesis kitarus.${prompt};How is everything going?${prompt}
Of course, it's anyone's guess as to whether or not they'll be in stock.${prompt};How is your progress?
I'll give you ${article} ${item-article: 4[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 5[2]} once you have filled all the orders.${prompt};${selection-lines}
Here is the ${choice: 0}[first/second/last] order.${prompt};Fine.
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Nouveil in ${unknown: 0x01053782E78180}.${prompt};I give up.${prompt}
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Yaman-Hachuman in the Orastery in ${unknown: 0x01053782F08180}.${prompt};Glad-wad to hear it!${prompt}
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Yaman-Hachuman in the Orastery in ${unknown: 0x01053782F08180}.${prompt};Terrible news indeed! Are you sure there's nothing to be done?${prompt}
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Nouveil in ${unknown: 0x01053782E78180}.${prompt};Really give up?
For those, it doesn't matter whether or not you make it at their side.${prompt};${selection-lines}
Report back once you have delivered-wivered the items.${prompt};Not yet.
Your current requestaru is...${prompt};Yes.${prompt}
How is everything going?${prompt};That's too bad-wad. I'll just have to get someone else to fill the order.${prompt}
How is your progress?;Not that I can blame you for wanting a break. Let me know when you change your mind.${prompt}
${selection-lines};I trust that everything is going well? Let me give you your next assignment.${prompt}
Fine.;I've received work that the order was successfully filled-willed. Well done!${prompt}
I give up.${prompt};I've received work that the order was successfully filled-willed. Well done!${prompt}
Glad-wad to hear it!${prompt};As promised, let me present you wtih ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Terrible news indeed! Are you sure there's nothing to be done?${prompt};If you lose them, I can have them replaced...for a fee.${prompt}
Really give up?;You've gotten quite the hang of this, haven'taru you?${prompt}
${selection-lines};Ah, yes! The shield!${prompt}
Not yet.;Well, it looks fabulous indeed, and much lighter than I would have pictured.${prompt}
Yes.${prompt};I can barely wait to see what the next stage will bring with it!${prompt}
That's too bad-wad. I'll just have to get someone else to fill the order.${prompt};Ah, but perhaps now you have learned the innermost secrets of weaving. Why not give them a go?${prompt}
Not that I can blame you for wanting a break. Let me know when you change your mind.${prompt};Hello, friend. I see that you are ready-weady to take on the final upgrade.${prompt}
I trust that everything is going well? Let me give you your next assignment.${prompt};Now then, let me explain aboutaru how to obtain the necessary materials.${prompt}
I've received work that the order was successfully filled-willed. Well done!${prompt};The firstaru two things you'll need are ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt}
I've received work that the order was successfully filled-willed. Well done!${prompt};I have asked Julissois to hold-wold them for me. You simply need to exchange crafter points for them.${prompt}
As promised, let me present you wtih ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}.${prompt};The other material-waterial you'll require is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. I can produce it for you once your shield's Craftsmanship reaches 100%.${prompt}
If you lose them, I can have them replaced...for a fee.${prompt};That's it for my explanation. This being the last step, I thought it'd be a more difficultaru undertaking, but I guess not. Do be careful though.${prompt}
You've gotten quite the hang of this, haven'taru you?${prompt};I heard that Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno requires the ${item-singular: 0[2]} when it's finished-winished. Please try not to lose it.${prompt}
Ah, yes! The shield!${prompt};Ahh, welcome. Can I help you with something-womething?${prompt}
Well, it looks fabulous indeed, and much lighter than I would have pictured.${prompt};I see... The item you're looking for was a special requestaru made by a Tarutaru from Adoulin.${prompt}
I can barely wait to see what the next stage will bring with it!${prompt};We have a rather difficultaru situation here. I already sent it to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.${prompt}
Ah, but perhaps now you have learned the innermost secrets of weaving. Why not give them a go?${prompt};Therefore, I suppose you should visitaru Jeuno once again and see if it has been delivered.${prompt}
Hello, friend. I see that you are ready-weady to take on the final upgrade.${prompt};Ah, you came at just the rightaru time. I found that item you were looking for stuck in my loom.${prompt}
Now then, let me explain aboutaru how to obtain the necessary materials.${prompt};Hm? You need this thing? Yes, it was for you all along, so I don't see any problem-wroblem with you taking it.${prompt}
The firstaru two things you'll need are ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}.${prompt};Ahh, welcome. This must be it...${prompt}
I have asked Julissois to hold-wold them for me. You simply need to exchange crafter points for them.${prompt};Yes, the shield is quite amazing. I can tell justaru how much work has gone into its creation.${prompt}
The other material-waterial you'll require is ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]}. I can produce it for you once your shield's Craftsmanship reaches 100%.${prompt};The guild emblem that I worked so hard to lovingly-wovingly craft is nicely on display. It turned out even better than I expected.${prompt}
That's it for my explanation. This being the last step, I thought it'd be a more difficultaru undertaking, but I guess not. Do be careful though.${prompt};Now that you're finished, I would like to teach-weach you this new crafting technique.${prompt}
I heard that Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno requires the ${item-singular: 0[2]} when it's finished-winished. Please try not to lose it.${prompt};I know that you will be able to use this technique to further hone your craftaru. I look forward to seeing what you can become.${prompt}
Ahh, welcome. Can I help you with something-womething?${prompt};0: ${number: 0} 1: ${number: 1} 2: ${number: 2} 3: ${number: 3}${prompt}
I see... The item you're looking for was a special requestaru made by a Tarutaru from Adoulin.${prompt};Oh, it's you again. What's the storrry behind that shield?${prompt}
We have a rather difficultaru situation here. I already sent it to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.${prompt};Hmm... I see you've spoken with her. Like me, you're quite currrious about things.${prompt}
Therefore, I suppose you should visitaru Jeuno once again and see if it has been delivered.${prompt};According to her, that shield can boost one's crafting ability. If it's true, that's quite an incrrredible feat.${prompt}
Ah, you came at just the rightaru time. I found that item you were looking for stuck in my loom.${prompt};That's the shield, yes? I have the recipe, so I suppose I could do it if I had the time... I'm really busy, you see.${prompt}
Hm? You need this thing? Yes, it was for you all along, so I don't see any problem-wroblem with you taking it.${prompt};I know... She gave you the shield, yes? You're quite skilled at our crrraft, so how about you give it a try? Yes, it's settled then!${prompt}
Ahh, welcome. This must be it...${prompt};Listen up now. I'm going to teach you the rrrecipe, so pay attention.${prompt}
Yes, the shield is quite amazing. I can tell justaru how much work has gone into its creation.${prompt};So, firrrst, you'll need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to get started.${prompt}
The guild emblem that I worked so hard to lovingly-wovingly craft is nicely on display. It turned out even better than I expected.${prompt};Its purrrpose is to boost the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its full value.${prompt}
Now that you're finished, I would like to teach-weach you this new crafting technique.${prompt};Wait a moment. I have some notes on Craftsmanship that you should hear, so listen carrrefully.${prompt}
I know that you will be able to use this technique to further hone your craftaru. I look forward to seeing what you can become.${prompt};Did you catch all of that?${prompt}
0: ${number: 0} 1: ${number: 1} 2: ${number: 2} 3: ${number: 3}${prompt};Come see me when you've incrrreased the Craftsmanship rating. I'll make you the ${item-singular: 1[2]} that you require.${prompt}
Oh, it's you again. What's the storrry behind that shield?${prompt};Next on your list are ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. You can get them by speaking to Tergil.${prompt}
Hmm... I see you've spoken with her. Like me, you're quite currrious about things.${prompt};I imagine you've made deliveries for people, yes? This is basically the same idea.${prompt}
According to her, that shield can boost one's crafting ability. If it's true, that's quite an incrrredible feat.${prompt};You can speak to Tergil for furrrther details.${prompt}
That's the shield, yes? I have the recipe, so I suppose I could do it if I had the time... I'm really busy, you see.${prompt};That's it for the ingredients. Come show me the shield after it's been upgraded. I'm currrious to see it for myself.${prompt}
I know... She gave you the shield, yes? You're quite skilled at our crrraft, so how about you give it a try? Yes, it's settled then!${prompt};Hm? You forrrgot the recipe already? Okay, here's the list again. Remember, skilled craftsmen only need to hear this once.${prompt}
Listen up now. I'm going to teach you the rrrecipe, so pay attention.${prompt};You've managed to match even my skill as a craftsman. I'm prrretty confident that you can make this shield.${prompt}
So, firrrst, you'll need ${article} ${item-article: 1[2]} to get started.${prompt};Yes, very well done indeed! With this, I can make the ${item-singular: 0[2]} no prrroblem.${prompt}
Its purrrpose is to boost the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 0[2]} to its full value.${prompt};So, this is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Wait a moment. I have some notes on Craftsmanship that you should hear, so listen carrrefully.${prompt};The technique to imbue a craftsman's soul into the shield to form a crystal... It makes no sense to me, but I can definitely feel its power.${prompt}
Did you catch all of that?${prompt};Hmm... It appears that by creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, it also reduced the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
Come see me when you've incrrreased the Craftsmanship rating. I'll make you the ${item-singular: 1[2]} that you require.${prompt};That's fine if you only need to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but you'll have to raise the Craftsmanship if you want to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
Next on your list are ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. You can get them by speaking to Tergil.${prompt};Of course, it's not like you'd ever need to do such a thing. Not someone as rrresponsible as you.${prompt}
I imagine you've made deliveries for people, yes? This is basically the same idea.${prompt};I don't believe it... You'rrre telling me that you lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt}
You can speak to Tergil for furrrther details.${prompt};Oh well. These things happen I guess. Let me see the shield. I'll crrraft you another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt}
That's it for the ingredients. Come show me the shield after it's been upgraded. I'm currrious to see it for myself.${prompt};You're an elite craftsman now. You need to take better care of your ingrrredients or you'll never get any work.${prompt}
Hm? You forrrgot the recipe already? Okay, here's the list again. Remember, skilled craftsmen only need to hear this once.${prompt};It seems you made the upgrrrade. Here, let me see how you did.${prompt}
You've managed to match even my skill as a craftsman. I'm prrretty confident that you can make this shield.${prompt};Hmm... I can see the differrrence and feel its power, but it's clearly not finished yet.${prompt}
Yes, very well done indeed! With this, I can make the ${item-singular: 0[2]} no prrroblem.${prompt};I'm sure she's already told you that you'll need to craft multiple times in order to achieve the expected rrresults.${prompt}
So, this is the ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};Oh yes... You need proof that the shield is complete. Wait just a moment and I'll get that rrready for you.${prompt}
The technique to imbue a craftsman's soul into the shield to form a crystal... It makes no sense to me, but I can definitely feel its power.${prompt};That should do it.${prompt}
Hmm... It appears that by creating the ${item-singular: 0[2]}, it also reduced the Craftsmanship of the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};Simply show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and you'rrre all set.${prompt}
That's fine if you only need to upgrade the ${item-singular: 1[2]}, but you'll have to raise the Craftsmanship if you want to make another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};Oh, one more thing. I often have deliveries for Tergil. I hope you'll agrrree to help me train the newer guild members.${prompt}
Of course, it's not like you'd ever need to do such a thing. Not someone as rrresponsible as you.${prompt};Hello therrre. Yes, I've been expecting you after speaking with you know who.${prompt}
I don't believe it... You'rrre telling me that you lost the ${item-singular: 0[2]}?${prompt};This is the recipe you'll need. Do try to rrremember it, will you?${prompt}
Oh well. These things happen I guess. Let me see the shield. I'll crrraft you another ${item-singular: 0[2]}.${prompt};I hope you didn't forrrget that already.${prompt}
You're an elite craftsman now. You need to take better care of your ingrrredients or you'll never get any work.${prompt};Now, let's discuss how to obtain the ingredients. Firrrst, you'll need to start with the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt}
It seems you made the upgrrrade. Here, let me see how you did.${prompt};You used this before, no? Like with the aspis, you'll need to crrraft while equipping the ${item-singular: 0[2]} in order to boost the shield's Craftsmanship.${prompt}
Hmm... I can see the differrrence and feel its power, but it's clearly not finished yet.${prompt};This time, though, you'll need to put in a little more effort.${prompt}
I'm sure she's already told you that you'll need to craft multiple times in order to achieve the expected rrresults.${prompt};Once you have increased the Craftsmanship to its maximum level, come see me and I'll crrreate the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt}
Oh yes... You need proof that the shield is complete. Wait just a moment and I'll get that rrready for you.${prompt};Next, you need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. Do you remember the ${item-singular: 3[2]} frrrom before? I've given both of them to Tergil.${prompt}
That should do it.${prompt};Last is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. With the help of the A.M.A.N., I've prrrepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt}
Simply show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and you'rrre all set.${prompt};You can rrrefer to the Records of Eminence menu for more details. Once you've cleared them all, you'll get the ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt}
Oh, one more thing. I often have deliveries for Tergil. I hope you'll agrrree to help me train the newer guild members.${prompt};That's it. I know it's harrrd work gathering all of these ingredients, but you've been through worse, no? I know you'll be fine!${prompt}
Hello therrre. Yes, I've been expecting you after speaking with you know who.${prompt};Oh, it seems the shield's Craftsmanship has drrropped.${prompt}
This is the recipe you'll need. Do try to rrremember it, will you?${prompt};Wait just a moment. I'll have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you beforrre long.${prompt}
I hope you didn't forrrget that already.${prompt};Ahh, it turned out just perrrfectly.${prompt}
Now, let's discuss how to obtain the ingredients. Firrrst, you'll need to start with the ${item-singular: 1[2]}.${prompt};Ahh... It looks like crrreating the ${item-singular: 0[2]} has once again caused the shield's Craftsmanship to drop.${prompt}
You used this before, no? Like with the aspis, you'll need to crrraft while equipping the ${item-singular: 0[2]} in order to boost the shield's Craftsmanship.${prompt};It is no easy task to increase its Craftsmanship, so keep it in a safe place until you're rrready to use it, understood?${prompt}
This time, though, you'll need to put in a little more effort.${prompt};Hah... Something about this shield is quite fascinating. Did you use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or something?${prompt}
Once you have increased the Craftsmanship to its maximum level, come see me and I'll crrreate the ${item-singular: 1[2]} for you.${prompt};Yes, I can sense the power of this new shield. It feels rrremarkably different from the previous one.${prompt}
Next, you need ${article} ${item-article: 2[2]} and ${article} ${item-article: 3[2]}. Do you remember the ${item-singular: 3[2]} frrrom before? I've given both of them to Tergil.${prompt};Here, allow me to marrrk it for when you show it to her.${prompt}
Last is the ${item-singular: 4[2]}. With the help of the A.M.A.N., I've prrrepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you.${prompt};Therrre you go. Take this shield to Mewk Chorosap to complete your task.${prompt}
You can rrrefer to the Records of Eminence menu for more details. Once you've cleared them all, you'll get the ${item-singular: 4[2]}.${prompt};This simply will not do. You'rrre going to need to face the final objective once again.${prompt}
That's it. I know it's harrrd work gathering all of these ingredients, but you've been through worse, no? I know you'll be fine!${prompt};You've done well. Now, let's go over the next rrrecipe.${prompt}
Oh, it seems the shield's Craftsmanship has drrropped.${prompt};What's this? You alrrready know the recipe and how to obtain some of the ingredients? Well, this should go quickly then.${prompt}
Wait just a moment. I'll have the ${item-singular: 0[2]} for you beforrre long.${prompt};That just leaves the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}. Very well then.${prompt}
Ahh, it turned out just perrrfectly.${prompt};We have some customers coming to orrrder items from us, so I'm going to have you make the items near them and make the delivery.${prompt}
Ahh... It looks like crrreating the ${item-singular: 0[2]} has once again caused the shield's Craftsmanship to drop.${prompt};It seems many of our customers are quite knowledgeable about boneworking, so they want to see our craftsmen's work up close and perrrsonal.${prompt}
It is no easy task to increase its Craftsmanship, so keep it in a safe place until you're rrready to use it, understood?${prompt};As such, only items made in front of the customer will be accepted, although there are some exceptions to this rrrule.${prompt}
Hah... Something about this shield is quite fascinating. Did you use ${article} ${item-article: 0[2]} or something?${prompt};Forrrgive me, but you'll need to gather the necessary materials to create the item yourself. Fortunately, it doesn't matter how you get them.${prompt}
Yes, I can sense the power of this new shield. It feels rrremarkably different from the previous one.${prompt};By the way, we've reached an agrrreement with the other guilds to buy and sell items that aren't normally available, assuming you have the money.${prompt}
Here, allow me to marrrk it for when you show it to her.${prompt};You can see the items available in this area by speaking to each guild's crafting set vendor. I suppose it'll prrrove quite useful for you.${prompt}
Therrre you go. Take this shield to Mewk Chorosap to complete your task.${prompt};Although, note that each guild is free to set its own rrrules, so you may not always be able to get what you want.${prompt}
This simply will not do. You'rrre going to need to face the final objective once again.${prompt};Once you complete all of the customer requests, I'll give you the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]} as prrromised. Good luck out there.${prompt}
You've done well. Now, let's go over the next rrrecipe.${prompt};This is the ${choice: 0}[first/next/last] request.${prompt}
What's this? You alrrready know the recipe and how to obtain some of the ingredients? Well, this should go quickly then.${prompt};Make a deliverrry of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Silver Owl at the Tenshodo in ${unknown: 0x01053782EC8180}.${prompt}
That just leaves the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]}. Very well then.${prompt};Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Crooked Arrow in ${unknown: 0x01053782F38180}. You can find him in frrront of the Auction House.${prompt}
We have some customers coming to orrrder items from us, so I'm going to have you make the items near them and make the delivery.${prompt};Make a deliverrry of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Silver Owl at the Tenshodo in ${unknown: 0x01053782EC8180}.${prompt}
It seems many of our customers are quite knowledgeable about boneworking, so they want to see our craftsmen's work up close and perrrsonal.${prompt};Make a deliverrry of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Pawkrix at Muckvix's Junk Shop in ${unknown: 0x01053782F58180}.${prompt}
As such, only items made in front of the customer will be accepted, although there are some exceptions to this rrrule.${prompt};Oh, this is an item that doesn't need to be crrrafted near the customer.${prompt}
Forrrgive me, but you'll need to gather the necessary materials to create the item yourself. Fortunately, it doesn't matter how you get them.${prompt};Don't forrrget to report back to me once you finish the request.${prompt}
By the way, we've reached an agrrreement with the other guilds to buy and sell items that aren't normally available, assuming you have the money.${prompt};The current request you're worrrking on is...${prompt}
You can see the items available in this area by speaking to each guild's crafting set vendor. I suppose it'll prrrove quite useful for you.${prompt};How is the request coming along? Everything is going accorrrding to schedule?${prompt}
Although, note that each guild is free to set its own rrrules, so you may not always be able to get what you want.${prompt};Everything okay?
Once you complete all of the customer requests, I'll give you the ${item-singular: 4[2]} and ${item-singular: 5[2]} as prrromised. Good luck out there.${prompt};${selection-lines}
This is the ${choice: 0}[first/next/last] request.${prompt};Everything's great!
Make a deliverrry of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Silver Owl at the Tenshodo in ${unknown: 0x01053782EC8180}.${prompt};It could be better...${prompt}
Deliver ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Crooked Arrow in ${unknown: 0x01053782F38180}. You can find him in frrront of the Auction House.${prompt};I know I can always count on you. Keep up the good work!${prompt}
Make a deliverrry of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Silver Owl at the Tenshodo in ${unknown: 0x01053782EC8180}.${prompt};Hm? What's the matter?! You don't sound very well at all... Are you surrre you're feeling okay? Do you want to give up?${prompt}
Make a deliverrry of ${number: 1} ${item-given-plurality: 1[2], 0[2]} to Pawkrix at Muckvix's Junk Shop in ${unknown: 0x01053782F58180}.${prompt};Will you see this through?
Oh, this is an item that doesn't need to be crrrafted near the customer.${prompt};${selection-lines}
Don't forrrget to report back to me once you finish the request.${prompt};I'll do my best.
The current request you're worrrking on is...${prompt};I've had enough.${prompt}
How is the request coming along? Everything is going accorrrding to schedule?${prompt};I see... I guess you have been working prrretty hard recently. Very well. I'll ask another craftsman to help me.${prompt}
Everything okay?;Try not to push yourself too harrrd. Take a rest for now and I'll have another customer for you when you're ready.${prompt}
${selection-lines};Hello. You look like you're feeling better. Indeed, you're not nearrrly as pale as you were before! Okay, let's get down to business, shall we?${prompt}
